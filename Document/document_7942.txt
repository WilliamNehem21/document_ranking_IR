The Australian raven was first depicted by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they detailed George Caley's initial notes on the species from the Sydney area. Its particular designation "coronoides" "crow-molded" is gotten from the Greek "corone"/ÃÂºÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂÃÂ½ÃÂ· "crow" and "eidos"/ÃÂµÃÂ¯ÃÂ´ÃÂ¿ÃÂ "shape" or "structure". The two naturalists viewed the Australian raven as fundamentally the same as in appearance to the flesh crow ("C. corone") of Europe, however they noted it was bigger with a more drawn out bill. They didn't give it a typical name. The area where the sort example was gathered isn't recorded, yet thought to be in the Parramatta region. Christian Ludwig Brehm portrayed "Corvus affinis" in 1845, later resolved to be this species. In his 1865 "Handbook to the Birds of Australia", John Gould perceived just a single types of corvid in Australia, "Corvus australis", which he called the white-looked at crow. He utilized Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name, which originated before Vigors and Horsfield's depiction. In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe perceived two species, yet recorded that the plume bases of the sort example of "C. coronoides" were white. He named "C. coronoides" as the "crow" and "C. australis" (as "Corone australis") the "raven". Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant remedied this in 1912 after rethinking the sort example, clearing up the species as "C. coronoides" (raven, and joining close to nothing and backwoods ravens) and "C. cecilae" (Torresian crow).
