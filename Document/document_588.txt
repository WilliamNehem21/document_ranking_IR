Indeed, even before Sestak formally proclaimed his appointment on August 4, 2009, Specter and Sestak started trading reactions about one another that were so warmed, "The New York Times" essayist Janie Lorber proposed "the challenge will wind up one of the more horrendous for one year from now's midterm decisions". Sestak over and again said Specter was not a "genuine Democrat" and kept on declaring Specter's switch depended on self-safeguarding as opposed to standards. Ghost called Sestak a "blatant wolf in sheep's clothing" for scrutinizing Specter's faithfulness to the Democratic Party, refering to the way that Sestak himself was enlisted as an Independent until he turned into a Democrat in 2006, just before he kept running for Congress. Sestak asserted that was on the grounds that he was serving in the military and wished to be fair, yet Specter considered that a "weak reason for maintaining a strategic distance from gathering alliance ... undercut by his reported lack of engagement in the political procedure", bringing up that records demonstrated Sestak casted a ballot in just 12 out of 35 races from 1971 to 2005. Multi day after Sestak formally entered the race, Specter depicted Sestak's ongoing 67-province visit as a "citizen financed self-advancement visit around the state". Ghost's battle likewise blamed Sestak for dismissing his obligations in the House and missing in excess of 100 votes in the most recent year, which Specter called the most noticeably awful participation record for any Pennsylvania Congressman. Sestak reacted to the last point that the majority of the missed votes were procedural in nature, and were missed due to the statewide visit and on the grounds that he visited his dad, who was kicking the bucket at the time. Sestak blamed Specter for propelling a "GOP negative style battle", which Specter denied.
