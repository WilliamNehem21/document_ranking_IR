In 1953, Birger Bohlin named "Troodon" "bexelli" in view of a parietal bone from China. In 1964, Oskar Kuhn considered this as an unequivocal types of "Stegoceras"; "S. bexelli". In 1974, the Polish scientistss Teresa MaryaÃÂska and Halszka OsmÃÂ³lska reasoned that the "gastralia" of "Stegoceras" were solidified ligaments, subsequent to distinguishing such structures in the tail of "Homalocephale". In 1979, William Patrick Wall and Peter Galton named the new species "Stegoceras browni", in light of a straightened arch, once in the past depicted as a female "S. validus" by Galton in 1971. The particular name respects Barnum Brown, who found the holotype (example AMNH 5450 in the American Museum of Natural History) in Alberta. In 1983, Galton and Hans-Dieter Sues moved "S. browni" to its own family, "Ornatotholus" ("ornatus" is Latin for "enhanced" and "tholus" for "arch"), and thought of it as the principal known American individual from a gathering of "level headed" pachycephalosaurs, recently known from Asia. In a 1987 survey of the pachycephalosaurs, Sues and Galton improved the particular name "validus" to "validum", which has therefore been utilized in the logical writing. These creators synonymized "S. brevis", "S. sternbergi", and "S. lambei" with "S. validum", found that "S. bexelli" contrasted from "Stegoceras" in a few highlights, and thought of it as a vague pachycephalosaur.
