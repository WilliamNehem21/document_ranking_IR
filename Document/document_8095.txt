Commentators trusted that the principal section, "Dispatch of the "Shouting Narwhal"", was a decent begin to the amusement. Ryan Scott of GameSpy composed that the riddles "for the most part challenge [the player] "only" enough without winding up excessively disappointing", while Eurogamer's Kristan Reed expressed that their quality was "strike against over and over". Be that as it may, analysis was coordinated toward specific riddles' structuresÃ¢ÂÂespecially toward that of one labyrinth baffle. The composition and story were praised, with a few audits recognizing the exchange's silliness. Experience Gamers staff essayist Evan Dickens felt that composing did not coordinate to the nature of "LeChuck's Revenge", in any case. In spite of the fact that the section's supporting cast was viewed as feeble, pundits delighted in the acquaintance of de Singe with the arrangement. The voicework for the primary characters was lauded, just like Land's soundtrack. Faultfinders were generally complimentary toward the scene's designs, with "New Straits Times" Bruno Chan and "The Sunday Times" David Phelan commending the refreshed translation of "The Curse of Monkey Island"s workmanship style while 1UP.com's Bob Mackey called Guybrush "the most convincingly expressive Telltale character yet"; in any case, concerns were voiced over unpredictable graphical quality between characters. The amusement's controls were liable to upbraiding by various surveys; a few favored the console powers over Telltale's new "snap and drag" framework.
