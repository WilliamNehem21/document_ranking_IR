In 2017, two French colour versions were created by Casterman and Moulinsart. 
In his study of the cultural and literary legacy of Brussels, AndrÃ© De Vries remarked that "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets" was "crude by HergÃ©'s later standards, in every sense of the word". Simon Kuper of the "Financial Times" criticised both "Land of the Soviets" and "Tintin in the Congo" as the "worst" of the "Adventures", being "poorly drawn" and "largely plot-free". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that HergÃ© had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie ApostolidÃ¨s of Stanford University, HergÃ© cast the Bolsheviks as "absolute evil" but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet "world of misery" and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as "fairly straightforward" and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as "pantomime cut-outs".
