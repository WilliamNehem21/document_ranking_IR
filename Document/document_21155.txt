On 1 February 1944, "FusÅ" departed Truk with "Nagato" to avoid an American air raid, and arrived at Palau on 4 February. They left on 16 February to escape another air raid. The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, and "FusÅ" was employed there as a training ship. A week later, Captain Masami Ban relieved Tsuruoka. The ship was refitted at Singapore between 13 and 27 April, and returned to Lingga. She was transferred to Tawi-Tawi on 11 May and provided cover for the convoy that failed to reinforce Biak Island at the end of the month. "FusÅ" transferred to Tarakan Island off Borneo to refuel in early July before returning to Japan and escaping an attack by the submarine . In early August at Kure, she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. "FusÅ" and her sister ship were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the 2nd Fleet on 10 September, and "FusÅ" became the flagship of the division under the command of Vice-Admiral ShÅji Nishimura on 23 September. They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga, escaping an attack by the submarine the next day, and arrived on 4 October, where Nishimura transferred his flag to "Yamashiro". The ships then transferred to Brunei to refuel in preparation for Operation "ShÅ-GÅ", the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the invasion of Luzon.
