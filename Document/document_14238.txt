It isn't known whether he had any relatives, however the recorder ÃÂthelweard was an incredible extraordinary grandson of King ÃÂthelred, and this may have experienced ÃÂthelwold. Shashi Jayakumar proposes the competition between King Eadwig and his more youthful sibling Edgar during the 950s goes back to the contention which brought about the Battle of the Holme. Eadwig's better half, ÃÂlfgifu, was likely ÃÂthelweard's sister, and one of Eadwig's supporters, Byrhtnoth, may have been slid from the Mercian imperial family through the ÃÂ¦theling Beorhtnoth, whose child Byrhtsige kicked the bucket battling on ÃÂthelwold's side at the Holme. Adversaries of Eadwig incorporated his grandma, Eadgifu, and Eadwig seized her property. In Jayakumar's view: "The rise of ÃÂlfgifu, relative of the ÃÂ¦theling ÃÂthelwold, did not simply compromise Edgar's position, it spoke to a "revanche" to a line and genealogy with regal cases of its ownÃÂ ... The precursors of Byrhtnoth and ÃÂthelweard had more then likely battled together with ÃÂthelwold on the "Danish" side at the Battle of the Holme, the contrary side to that which Eadgifu's dad Sigehelm had battled for." The marriage among Eadwig and ÃÂlfgifu was disintegrated on the grounds of affiliation, and Edgar prevailing to the position of authority when Eadwig passed on without leaving kids. In the perspective on Nick Higham, ÃÂthelweard demonstrates an "absence of sympathy" for Edward in his narrative, which Higham credits to Edward's triumph over ÃÂthelweard's precursor. ÃÂthelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century, demonstrating that ÃÂthelred's relatives clutched land and power in the century after his passing. ÃÂthelweard's grandson, ÃÂthelnoth, was an eleventh-century Archbishop of Canterbury.
