"Brandenburg" and the remainder of the armada worked under the typical daily schedule of individual and unit preparing in the main portion of 1897. Right off the bat in the year, the maritime order considered sending the I Division to another maritime exhibition off Morocco to dissent the homicide of two German nationals there, however a littler squadron of cruising frigates was sent. The run of the mill routine was hindered toward the beginning of August when Wilhelm II and "Kaiserin" (Empress) Augusta went to visit the Russian royal court; the two divisions of the I Squadron were sent to Kronstadt to go with the Kaiser, who continued to the capital at Saint Petersburg. They had come back to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the remainder of the armada went along with them for the yearly harvest time moves. These activities mirrored the strategic reasoning of the new State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt", "Konteradmiral" Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new administrator of the I Squadron, "Vizeadmiral" August von Thomsen. These new strategies focused precise gunnery, particularly at longer ranges, however the necessities of the line-ahead development prompted a lot of unbending nature in the strategies. Thomsen's accentuation on shooting made the reason for the incredible German gunnery amid World War I. The moves were finished by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven.
