On March 24, La Salle took 52Â men in fiveÂ canoes to find a less exposed settlement site. They found Garcitas Creek that had fresh water and fish, with good soil along its banks. They named it RiviÃ¨re aux Boeufs for the nearby buffalo herds. The fort was constructed on a bluff overlooking the creek, 1.5Â leagues from its mouth. TwoÂ men died, one of a rattlesnake bite and another from drowning while trying to fish. At night, the Karankawa would sometimes surround the camp and howl, but the soldiers could scare them away with a few gun shots. The fort has sometimes been referred to as "Fort St. Louis" but that name was not used during the life of the settlement and appears to be a later invention.
In early June, La Salle summoned the rest of the colonists from the temporary campsite to the new settlement site. SeventyÂ people began the overland trek on June 12. All of the supplies had to be hauled from the "Belle", a physically draining task that was finally completed by the middle of July. The last load was accompanied by the 30Â men who had remained behind to guard the ship. Although trees grew near the site, they were not suitable for building, and timber had to be transported to the building site from several miles inland. Some timbers were salvaged from the "Aimable". By the end of July, over half of the settlers had died, most from a combination of scant rations and overwork.
