As Speaker, Polk worked for the strategies of Jackson and later Van Buren. Polk selected advisory groups with Democratic seats and greater parts, including the New York radical C. C. Cambreleng as the new Ways and Means seat, in spite of the fact that he attempted to keep up the Speaker's customary neutral appearance. The two noteworthy issues amid Polk's speakership were servitude and, after the Panic of 1837, the economy. Polk solidly implemented the "choke rule", by which the House of Representatives would not acknowledge or discuss native petitions in regards to subjection. This touched off wild challenges from John Quincy Adams, who was by then a congressman from Massachusetts and an abolitionist. Rather than figuring out how to quiet Adams, Polk every now and again occupied with futile yelling matches, driving Jackson to reason that the Speaker ought to have indicated better initiative. Van Buren and Polk confronted strain to repeal the Specie Circular, Jackson's 1836 request that installment for government lands be in gold and silver. Some trusted this had prompted the accident by causing an absence of trust in paper cash issued by banks. In spite of such contentions, with help from Polk and his bureau, Van Buren upheld the Specie Circular. Polk and Van Buren endeavored to build up an Independent Treasury framework that would enable the administration to direct its own stores (as opposed to utilizing pet banks), yet the bill was crushed in the House. It in the long run go in 1840.
