In spite of the fact that the presentation of the Bagnall trains and the traffic created by the works at Waddesdon Manor had supported the line's fortunes, it stayed in genuine budgetary trouble. The main association with the national railroad arrange was by the turntable at Quainton Road. In spite of the fact that the third Duke of Buckingham was both the proprietor of the Wotton Tramway and Chairman of the A&B, the last viewed the Tramway as an aggravation, and during the 1870s sought after a strategy of charging excessively high expenses for through traffic between the Tramway and the principle line, with the aim of constraining the Tramway bankrupt. A&B trains would purposely miss associations with the Tramway, causing milk transported by means of Quainton Road to end up unsellable. The Tramway looked for legitimate counsel and was educated that the Duke would probably win a lawful activity against the A&B. Notwithstanding, the A&B was in such a problematic money related position, that any fruitful legitimate activity against it would almost certainly have constrained its through Quainton Road to shut down, separating the Tramway's association with the national system. Numerous Tramway travelers changed trains at Quainton Road to proceed with their adventure on the A&B; in 1885, 5,192 travelers did as such. The Tramway's administration proposed that the A&B sponsor the Tramway to the entirety of ÃÂ£25 (about ÃÂ£ in 2019) every month to permit traveler administrations to proceed, however the A&B consented to pay just ÃÂ£5 (about ÃÂ£ in 2019) every month. By the mid-1880s the Tramway was thinking that its hard to cover the working costs of either merchandise or traveler activities.
