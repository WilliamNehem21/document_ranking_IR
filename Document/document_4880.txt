Inferable from minefields close to the town, flotsam and jetsam hindering its boulevards and German holdouts assaulting the tanks, it was not until 1400 that the regiment had the capacity to gain ground. By 1430 the squadron touched base on an edge south of Cheux where it was locked in by twenty Panzer IVs, sent by the twelfth SS Panzer Division from the Rauray zone, Tiger tanks from the third Company 101st Heavy SS Panzer Battalion and protective layer from the 21st Panzer Division. More tanks from the eleventh Armored Division arrived yet decided German opposition stopped any further development and before the day's over the division had lost twenty-one tanks. At 1800 the 227th (Highland) Brigade of the fifteenth (Scottish) Infantry Division, was focused on the fight. The Highlanders were deferred by battling in help of the remainder of the division and just two organizations from the second Battalion Gordon Highlanders gained much ground. They entered the northern edges of Colleville by 2100 yet before long wound up cut off by German counter-assaults.
