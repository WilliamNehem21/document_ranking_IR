"Century Falls" is thoughtfully a lot darker than its ancestor "Dull Season" and his later work, which Davies ascribed to a pattern that unpracticed essayists "get off on the dim stuff": in a BAFTA meet with Davies, Home reviewed that she "practically got into inconvenience since it did really push at the limits which a portion of the forces that-be would preferably not have been pushed"; and a "Day by day Mail" survey of the arrangement thought about the show's subjects of fire related crime, dark enchantment, and shared dread as being "on a scale ordinarily held for pinnacle time grown-up survey". The arrangement offered a feeling of authenticity in its hero, who isn't courageous and optimistic, has poor social abilities, and is gruffly portrayed by Ben as a "hefty young lady", a training that the "Day by day Mail" adulated as "something that resists the Thought Police". "Century Falls" was the last content he composed for the BBC's kids' specialization for a long time. He had started to define another successor: "The Heat of the Sun", an arrangement set over Christmas 1999 and New Year's Day 2000 that would have incorporated the ideas of clairvoyant forces and global control.
