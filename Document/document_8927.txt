On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a broadcast discourse including what turned into his most cited articulation. "I don't trust in greater part rule ever in RhodesiaÃ¢ÂÂnot in 1,000 years," he said. "I rehash that I put stock in blacks and whites cooperating. On the off chance that one day it is white and the following day it is dark, I trust we have fizzled and it will be a catastrophe for Rhodesia." The main sentence of this announcement turned out to be generally cited as proof that Smith was an unrefined bigot who might never bargain with the dark patriots, despite the fact that the discourse was one in which Smith had said that control imparting to dark Rhodesians was inescapable and that "we must acknowledge that later on Rhodesia is a nation for high contrast, not white rather than dark and the other way around". The "not in 1,000 years" remark was, as per Peter Godwin, an endeavor to console the RF's conservative, which restricted any change at all, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 history of Smith, Berlyn remarks that paying little heed to whether the announcement was "taken outside of any relevant connection to the issue at hand, or whether his real purpose was misconstrued", this was one of his most prominent goofs as Prime Minister as it gave evident ammo to his depreciators.
