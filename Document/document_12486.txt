Pitt was given a role as an Irish Gypsy fighter with a scarcely understandable complement in Guy Ritchie's 2000 criminal film "Grab". A few commentators were disparaging of "Grab"; be that as it may, most adulated Pitt. Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" said Pitt was "in a perfect world give a role as an Irishman whose complement is so thick even Brits can't get him", proceeding to state that, before "Grab", Pitt had been "shackled by jobs that called for agonizing reflection, yet as of late he has discovered his bringing in dark comic unbelievability and conspicuous extroversion;" while Amy Taubin of "The Village Voice" asserted that "Pitt gets greatest comic mileage out of a one-joke job". The next year Pitt featured inverse Julia Roberts in the lighthearted comedy "The Mexican", a film that accumulated a scope of surveys however delighted in film industry achievement. Pitt's next job, in 2001's $143ÃÂ million-earning Cold War spine chiller "Spy Game", was as Tom Bishop, an employable of the CIA's Special Activities Division, tutored by Robert Redford's character. Imprint Holcomb of Salon.com appreciated the film, despite the fact that he noticed that neither Pitt nor Redford gave "quite a bit of an enthusiastic association for the group of onlookers".
