Despite the relative failure of the project as a whole, the individual games of the Capcom Five had a lasting impact on game design. After experimenting with action gameplay in "P.N.03", Mikami was able to apply his experience to "Vanquish", which serves as an evolution and refinement of the former's gameplay. On the other hand, Adam Sorice of Nintendojo suggested that the commercial failure of such a women-driven game made Capcom reluctant to feature female leads in future games for a number of years.

On a broader scale, "Resident Evil 4" deconstructed the survival horror conventions the first "Resident Evil" games established. Some reviewers accused the game of abandoning the genre's essence by adopting an increased emphasis on action and combat. Following "Resident Evil 4"s lead, many "horror" games in the next few years would shift toward more combat-heavy gameplay, including "" and "Alone in the Dark".
