1973 saw the culmination of the rooftop around the outline of the arena, alongside the expansion of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the substitution of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. At that point, in 1975, a ÃÂ£3ÃÂ million development was started, beginning with the expansion of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's eatery disregarded the pitch, however the view was as yet hindered by the rooftop columns. Along these lines, in kind with the tops of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand rooftop was supplanted with a cantilever structure. The Executive Suite and cantilever rooftop were then reached out to the full length of the stand, taking into account the movement of the club workplaces from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then evacuated and supplanted in 1985 with a situated segment bringing the all out seating limit of the arena to 25,686 (56,385 generally speaking). The fulfillment of the cantilever rooftop around three sides of the arena took into account the substitution of the old floodlight arches, and the connection of a column of floodlights around the internal edge of the rooftop in 1987.
