The remainder of the killings in the Whitechapel record was submitted on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was killed under a railroad curve. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson just minutes after the assault at 2:15ÃÂ am at Swallow Gardens, a path under a railroad curve between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor injuries on the back of her head propose that she was tossed fiercely to the ground before her throat was cut no less than twice, from left to right and after that back once more. Generally there were no mutilations to the body. Director Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon a while later from the adjacent Leman Street police headquarters, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been associated with the past homicide examinations, landed by 5ÃÂ am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles before, was captured by the police and accused of her homicide. A prominent examination by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's previous history and his whereabouts at the season of the past Whitechapel murders demonstrates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. Be that as it may, Sadler was discharged on 3 March for absence of proof.
