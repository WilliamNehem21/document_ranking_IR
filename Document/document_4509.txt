The battle begins with a mission clarifying the sources of the Majapahit Empire, wherein Raden Wijaya drives the Javanese to triumph against the Mongols, the Singhasari, and the Kediri. Gajah Mada appropriate at that point shows up on the scene to save King Jayanegara from the city of Trowulan, which is encompassed by dissidents. Notwithstanding, Jayanegara is wicked and is before long killed. His sister, Tribhuwana, takes control and chooses Gajah Mada as her head administrator. Gajah Mada then swears his renowned Sumpah Palapa vow to bind together Nusantara, whereupon he won't eat any nourishment containing flavors until the entire Indonesian archipelago is bound together. The Majapahit realm at that point continues to grow settlements to the islands of Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo, and has clashes with the Sunda, Dhamasraya, and Temasek. The ruler official at that point surrenders to let her currently developed child, Hayam Wuruk, rise the position of royalty, and the Majapahit Empire at that point extends toward the east by annihilating the Docks of Makassar, Kutai, and Luwu. The sole gathering which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada controls them into a snare by orchestrating a marriage between his ruler and a Sunda princess. While the Sunda trust that the marriage will result in a collusion, Gajah Mada has composed into the agreement that by means of the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. The outcome is the Pasunda Bubat Massacre, wherein all the Sunda rulers are slaughtered and Hayam Wuruk's lady of the hour ends it all out of sadness. Gajah Mada is then gathered to the ruler and banished for his activities.
