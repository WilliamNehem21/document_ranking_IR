In the mid year of 1914, when World War I broke out in Europe, the Ottomans at first stayed nonpartisan. Toward the beginning of November, the Black Sea Raid of the German battlecruiser "Goeben", which had been exchanged to the Ottoman naval force and renamed "Yavuz Sultan Selim", brought about revelations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. At this point, "Turgut Reis" was laid up off the Golden Horn, exhausted from substantial administration amid the Balkan Wars. Naval commander , the leader of the German maritime mission to the Ottoman Empire, sent her and "Barbaros Hayreddin" to Nagara to help the Dardanelles fortifications. They stayed on station from 14 to 19 December, before coming back to Constantinople for fixes and gunnery preparing. On 18 February 1915, they left for the Dardanelles and tied down in their terminating positions. Amid this period, their motors were halted to safeguard fuel, yet after the danger of British submarines expanded, they kept steam up in their motors to save their capacity to make equivocal move; the steamer was moored before the ships as a skimming blast. By 11 March, the central leadership chose that just a single ship ought to be kept on station at once, rotating each five days, to enable the boats to recharge stores and ammo.
