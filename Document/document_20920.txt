Regarding the presentation, "Game Revolution"s Chris Hudak thought that "Super Mario Galaxy" was a "next-gen reincarnation" of "Super Mario 64", stating the game was polished, engaging and evocative. Alex Navarro of "GameSpot" commended the colourful and vibrant level details, animations and character designs, saying that "there simply isn't a better-looking Wii game available". Furthermore, Navarro praised the game engine's ability of keeping frame rate drops to "infrequent bouts". Bryn Williams of "GameSpy" asserted that the game had the best visuals on the Wii, saying that the graphics "are out of this world" and that its wide range of colours produces "better-than-expected" texturing. A reviewer from "GamesRadar" stated that "words simply can't describe" the game's visual concepts. Louis Bedigan from "GameZone" thought the visualisations from "Super Mario Galaxy" contrast from the blocky characters of previous "Super Mario" games, praising the planet designs as beautiful and everything else as "pure eye candy". Matt Casamassina of "IGN" thought "Super Mario Galaxy" was the only game that pushed the Wii console, stating it combines "great art" with "great tech", resulting in what he described to be "stunning results". David Halverson of "Play" opined that the game was "supremely" polished and featured "gorgeous next-gen" graphics.
