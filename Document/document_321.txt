In the field of diversion, Mutual based on the exceptional achievement of "The Shadow". WGN's "Chicago Theater of the Air", highlighting hour-long musical show and melodic theater preparations before a live group of onlookers, was communicated without precedent for May 1940. By 1943, the week by week show was being recorded before houses 4,000 in number, assembled to see exhibitions including a full ensemble and theme. "Chicago Theater of the Air" would keep running on Mutual through March 1955. Shared gave an early national outlet to the compelling, skeptical comedian Henry Morgan, whose show "Here's Morgan" started its system keep running in October 1940. However "The Lone Ranger" moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, inside a couple of months Mutual had another solid, and no less renowned, activity legend. "The Adventures of Superman", grabbed from WOR, would keep running on the system from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual propelled what might transform into one of its longest-enduring shows: appearing as "The Return of Nick Carter" and later retitled "Scratch Carter, Master Detective", it would be a system staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual circulated "The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, repeating their jobs from the Universal film arrangement. A prior manifestation of the show had run quickly on the system in 1936; a less starry adaptation would come back to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. "The Mysterious Traveler", a protoÃ¢ÂÂ "Strange place" treasury arrangement, circulated each week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.
