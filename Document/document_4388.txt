Maynard took order of the two furnished sloops on 17ÃÂ November. He was given 57ÃÂ menÃ¢ÂÂ33ÃÂ from HMS "Pearl" and 24 from HMS "Lyme". Maynard and the separation from HMS "Pearl" took the bigger of the two vessels and named her "Jane"; the rest took "Officer", directed by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde. Some from the two boats' non military personnel teams stayed on board. They cruised from Kecoughtan, along the James River, on 17ÃÂ November. The two sloops moved gradually, giving Brand's power time to achieve Bath. Brand set out for North Carolina six days after the fact, touching base inside three miles of Bath on 23ÃÂ November. Incorporated into Brand's power were a few North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to put down any neighborhood complaint to the nearness of remote fighters. Moore went into the town to check whether Teach was there, announcing back that he was not, however that the privateer was normal at "consistently." Brand at that point went to Governor Eden's home and educated him of his motivation. The following day, Brand sent two kayaks down Pamlico River to Ocracoke Inlet, to check whether Teach could be seen. They returned two days after the fact and provided details regarding what in the end unfolded.
