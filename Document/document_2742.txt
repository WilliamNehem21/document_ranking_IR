For the hostile, the corps was strengthened by the 368th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 71st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and the 47th Engineer Battalion. They were to make an achievement on the principal day in the region between the development of the 48th Guards and 184th Rifle Divisions, seizing Yekaterinovka and progressing on Varvarovka and Alexeyevka before the day's over. The assault was booked to start on 12 January 1943, yet was moved back two days attributable to railroad delays. By 13 January, 122 tanks from the militaryÃ¢ÂÂmost having a place with the corps' 113th and 195th BrigadesÃ¢ÂÂwere as yet deferred by upkeep issues. This was on the grounds that the Voronezh Front's underlying hostile arranging commanding that just the twelfth Tank Corps would battle in the principal assault, which brought about the new tanks of the fifteenth being exchanged to the twelfth and the twelfth's exhausted tanks to the fifteenth, despite the fact that it was later chosen that the whole armed force would battle in the task. The fifteenth along these lines had significantly less time to redesign in anticipation of the attack, and because of the 113th and 195th Brigades touching base in the fixation regions on 13 January with just 10 to 12 tanks due to the deferrals, the majority of the useful tanks were exchanged to the 88th Tank Brigade, which was raised to a quality of 74 tanks. This single detachment established the whole of the corps' protected troops engaged with the primary day's assault, as the 113th and 195th were put in armed force save until their tanks arrived.
