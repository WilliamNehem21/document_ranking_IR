"Voalavo" is a little rat looking like a mouse with dim hide. Types of the variety are among the littlest known nesomyines, close in size just to "Monticolomys koopmani". As far as outer morphology, "Voalavo" is scarcely not the same as "Eliurus"; hide shading designs, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) are all the equivalent in the two genera. Notwithstanding, all types of "Eliurus" have an articulated tuft of stretched hairs at the tip of the tail, an element that is missing in "Voalavo", despite the fact that the last has marginally longer hairs close to the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is tantamount to that of the longest-followed types of "Eliurus", Grandidier's tufted-followed rodent and Petter's tufted-followed rodent, however "V.ÃÂ antsahabensis" has a to some degree shorter tail. Moreover, the stack of the feet are bigger in "Eliurus", and explicitly, the thenar cushion (situated at the center of the bone structure) is roundabout and genuinely little in "Voalavo", yet more and bigger in "Eliurus". On the chest, "Voalavo" species have an organ that creates a sweet-swelling musk in reproducing guys; this organ is missing in "Eliurus". Dissimilar to all different nesomyines however "Brachyuromys", "Voalavo" comes up short on an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).
