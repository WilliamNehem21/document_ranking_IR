After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, "The grown-ups don't like it." He said he was told his songwriting was "not up to par", the sound was "unlistenable", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last yearâthere's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myselfâI'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing "In Utero" as it was. According to Cobain, "Of course, they want another "Nevermind", but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning."
