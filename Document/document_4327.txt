In 1076, the climb of the most acclaimed ruler of this Chalukya family, Vikramaditya VI, changed the parity of intensity for the Chalukyas. His fifty-year reign was a critical period in Karnataka's history and is alluded to as the "Chalukya Vikrama time". His triumphs over the Cholas in the late eleventh and mid twelfth hundreds of years put a conclusion to the Chola impact in the Vengi locale for all time. A portion of the outstanding contemporaneous feudatory groups of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya administration and the Southern Kalachuri. At their pinnacle, the Western Chalukyas ruled a huge domain extending from the Narmada River in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. Vikramaditya VI is viewed as a standout amongst the most compelling lords of Indian history. Imperative design works were made by these Chalukyas, particularly in the Tungabhadra stream valley, that filled in as an applied connection between the structure expressions of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas. With the debilitating of the Chalukyas in the decades following the passing of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas picked up their freedom.
