In January 1902 practices started at the OpÃÂ©ra-Comique for the opening of "PellÃÂ©as et MÃÂ©lisande". For three months, Debussy went to practices for all intents and purposes each day. In February there was struggle between Maeterlinck from one perspective and Debussy, Messager and CarrÃÂ© on the other about the throwing of MÃÂ©lisande. Maeterlinck needed his escort, Georgette Leblanc, to sing the job, and was enraged when she was ignored for the Scottish soprano Mary Garden. The musical drama opened on 30 April 1902, and in spite of the fact that the primary night group of onlookers was separated among admirers and doubters, the work rapidly turned into a triumph. It made Debussy an outstanding name in France and abroad; "The Times" remarked that the musical show had "incited more discourse than any work of present day times, with the exception of, obviously, those of Richard Strauss". The Apaches, driven by Ravel (who went to all of the 14 exhibitions in the primary run), were noisy in their help; the preservationist workforce of the Conservatoire attempted futile to prevent its understudies from seeing the musical show. The vocal score was distributed toward the beginning of May, and the full symphonic score in 1904.
