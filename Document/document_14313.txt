The primary pony mentor for JB Kobask as Thunder was Tom Hudson, the coach for Magness Arabians at the time. The mascot's first rider was Angela Moore, at that point a 19-year-old colleague coach to Hudson and an alum of Colorado State University. Ann Judge, otherwise called Ann Judge-Wegener, turned into Thunder's rider in 1998. After a year, Judge took over as coach just as rider. She has been the mentor and rider of Thunder II for his whole profession with the Broncos, and furthermore does as such for Thunder III. Judge experienced childhood with an Arabian pony ranch close West Lafayette, Indiana, and moved on from Purdue University in 1980 with a degree in English Education. She has ridden ponies since she was five years of age, was a member in 4-H as a young, and in the wake of completing school turned into a pony coach, first working in South Carolina and afterward in Colorado. Judge has been depicted by Broncos' administration as a "practiced equestrian". She has contended at the national dimension in Arabian and Pinto horse show rivalry. She is likewise a pony show judge who has arbitrated national and global occasions. Both Thunder II and Thunder III are stabled at Judge's ranch in Bennett, Colorado.
