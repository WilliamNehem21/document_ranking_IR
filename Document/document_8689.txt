Numerous charges of fabrication were brought against Pleydell in the Court of Chancery. Despite the fact that the conditions of many are obscure, a critical suit was started by Member for Chippenham Francis Newdigate toward the beginning of the 1563 parliamentary session, when Pleydell is known to have been in a lot of obligation. Newdigate, second husband of Anne Seymour (Pleydell's boss), blamed Pleydell for imitation with respect to the house of Monkton in his voting demographic, which his mate claimed and Gabriel had rented since 1559. Subtleties are vague, however Newdigate acquainted the case with the House of Commons somewhere in the range of 11 and 27 February 1563, presumably in light of talk encompassing the proposed Forgery Act 1563 (5 Eliz.1 c.14). On 22 March, the Commons collected a board of trustees made up of Recorder of London Richard Onslow, Sir Nicholas Arnold, Walter Haddon, Thomas Norton and Master of the Rolls Sir William Cordell to examine Newdigate's doubts. Cordell's association as an authority of the legal executive may show that Pleydell had again asserted parliamentary benefit against Newdigate's charges, since the case was heard in the Court of Chancery while he was a sitting Member for Wootton Bassett. The board of trustees communicated "extraordinary and intense doubt" of Pleydell in a report which he read and replied. On 10 April the House requested that duplicates of board of trustees records ought to be given to Pleydell and Newdigate and that Pleydell's proof would be kept by the Commons, and no further notice of the issue is clear.
