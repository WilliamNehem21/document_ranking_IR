Antiochus XII's first Nabataean crusade was propelled in 87 BC, and might have incorporated a fight close Motho, current Imtan in the district of Hauran, as proposed by student of history Hans Peter Roschinski, who drew on the compositions of Stephanus of Byzantium. The Byzantine student of history saved in his book, "Ethica", parts from a lost work by antiquarian Uranius of Apamea, who composed a book titled "Arabica", which has been dated to 300 AD. In the record of Uranius, King Antigonus I ( BC) is murdered at Motho by a ruler of the Arabs named Rabbel. The name Motho could allude to a northern city in Hauran or a southern city in Moab. The name of Antigonus was consistently "rectified" to Antiochus by various researchers who trusted that Uranius was alluding to Antiochus XII. History specialist JÃÂ³zef Milik rejected the act of amending Uranius' work. Antigonus I was really slaughtered in 301 BC at the Battle of Ipsus; Milik trusted that rather than Antigonus I or Antiochus XII, the entry alludes to Athenaeus, an authority of Antigonus who battled the Nabataeans. Roschinski thought of it as possible that Stephanus was conflating two occasions occurring amid the rule of the Nabataean King Rabbel I: a clash of the first Nabataean crusade at Motho in the north, and the fight from the second Nabataean battle in which Antiochus XII was killed. Shatzman, then again, noticed that no place in his work did Stephanus demonstrate that the skirmish of Motho occurred in the north.
