Thurlow suspected that Tyndall's persuasive style was found out from Mosley's precedent, while Trilling rather trusted that it depended on that of Hitler. As per Trilling, Tyndall's "discourses were self important yet studiedÃÂ ... [he] duplicated the hand signals, the rising conveyance that finished in a crescendo of irate designations [from Hitler]ÃÂ ... In any case, it was level and dreary, similar to a common PE educator endeavoring to demonstrate his exhausted students how the rugby or football greats may have done it." After Tyndall's demise, the BNP representative Phil Edwards said that "he was a superb speaker. He could hold a room and entrance them, however he didn't have the response to the issues." Copsey expressed that "Tyndall may have been an energizing speaker, yet his strategic knowledge and vision came up short". The East London BNP extremist Eddy Butler noticed that at a 1986 gathering rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall "lost them totally. He realized how to converse with a little room of patriots, yet he didn't have a clue how to converse with a thousand Yorkshire youthful geezers. He hadn't obtained some much needed education about typical individuals or ordinary governmental issues. He'd go on about the Britain of Sir Francis Drake; you'd believe 'what's he on about?'".
