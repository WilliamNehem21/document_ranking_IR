Amid Roman occasions, Volubilis was a noteworthy maker of olive oil. The remaining parts of structures devoted to olive squeezing are still promptly noticeable, just like the remaining parts of the first presses and olive plants. One such structure has been recreated with a full-estimate imitation of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was fundamental to the life of the city, as it was a foodstuff as well as was additionally utilized for lights, washing and drugs, while the squeezed olives were bolstered to creatures or dried out and utilized as fuel for the bathhouses. Thus, even the absolute most excellent manors had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-squeezing edifices have so far been found in Volubilis. They housed a standard arrangement of components: a plant, used to squash the olives, a decantation bowl to get the oil from squeezed olives, and a press that included a stabilizer, a "prelum" or cross-bar and the wooden backings inside which the "prelum" was fixed. The olives were first squashed into a glue, at that point put into woven bushels that were exposed to squeezing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation bowl, to which water was intermittently added to make the lighter oil buoy to the surface. This was then scooped out of the bowl and filled amphorae. There is likewise considerable proof of the city being a vivacious business focus. No less than 121 shops have been distinguished up until now, a large number of them pastry kitchens, and making a decision from the quantity of bronzes found at the site it might likewise have been an inside for the creation or circulation of bronze works of art.
