This viably left Pistrucci with little to do at the Mint. He made a few medallic works, for instance a little commemoration award for the King's sibling, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was well known, in regal circles, mounted in rings. He was approached to structure the Coronation award in the wake of King William IV went to the position of authority on George's passing in 1830, yet declined as he was approached to duplicate a bust by Chantrey, and the King would not sit for him. He made, in 1830Ã¢ÂÂ 1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-battle decoration of the British Army. He took a year to do as such, a timeframe Craig found unduly long. He kept on cutting appearances, and to work, gradually, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. Walk, attached his reluctance to take a shot at the Waterloo Medal to his despondency about his situation at the Mint, and he may have inferred that he would be sacked in the event that he completed the decoration. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, expressed that he felt the decoration could be done in year and a half, and offered Pistrucci installment in the event that he would take on four disciples and completion it. Pistrucci declined.
