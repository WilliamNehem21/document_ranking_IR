In 1903, at Willow Creek, Montana, several fossil osteoderms were discovered "lying upon the surface of the soil" by John Bell Hatcher and T.W. Stanton. These osteoderms were initially attributed to the ankylosaurid dinosaur "Euoplocephalus". Excavation at the site, carried out by W.H. Utterback, yielded further fossils, including additional osteoderms, as well as vertebrae, ribs, and a pubis. When these specimens were examined, it became clear that they belonged to a large crocodilian and not a dinosaur; upon learning this, Hatcher "immediately lost interest" in the material. After Hatcher died in 1904, his colleague W.J. Holland studied and described the fossils. Holland assigned these specimens to a new genus and species, "Deinosuchus hatcheri", in 1909. "Deinosuchus" comes from the Greek Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½ÏÏ/"deinos", meaning "terrible", and ÏÎ¿á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï/"suchos", meaning "crocodile".
A 1940 expedition by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more fossils of giant crocodilians, this time from Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name "Phobosuchus riograndensis". Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to "Deinosuchus", which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name "Phobosuchus", which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained a variety of different crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.
