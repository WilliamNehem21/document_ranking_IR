The child of Tughj ibn Juff, a general of Turkic inception who served both the Abbasids and the self-governing Tulunid leaders of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj was conceived in Baghdad however experienced childhood in Syria and obtained his first military and authoritative encounters at his dad's side. He had a violent early profession: he was detained alongside his dad by the Abbasids in 905, was discharged in 906, took part in the homicide of the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i in 908, and fled Iraq to enter the administration of the legislative leader of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. In the end he obtained the support of a few compelling Abbasid magnates, essentially the ground-breaking president Mu'nis al-Muzaffar. These binds drove him to being named representative first of Palestine and after that of Damascus. In 933, he was quickly named legislative leader of Egypt, yet this request was disavowed after the demise of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj needed to battle to save even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-named to Egypt, where he immediately vanquished a Fatimid intrusion and balanced out the tempestuous nation. His rule denotes an uncommon time of local harmony, strength and great government in the chronicles of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph al-Radi allowed his solicitation for the title of "al-Ikhshid", which had been borne by the leaders of his tribal Farghana Valley. It is by this title he was known from that point.
