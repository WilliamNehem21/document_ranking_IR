Lang kept away from continuation of the Prayer Book contention of 1928 by enabling the parliamentary procedure to slip by. He at that point approved an announcement allowing utilization of the rejected Book locally if the parochial church committee gave endorsement. The issue stayed lethargic for the remainder of Lang's residency at Canterbury. He drove the 1930 Lambeth Conference, where further advancement was made in improving relations with the Orthodox Churches and the Old Catholics, albeit again no understanding could be come to with the non-episcopal Free Churches. On an issue of more noteworthy worry to standard individuals, the Conference gave restricted endorsement, out of the blue, to the utilization of preventative gadgets, an issue in which Lang had no intrigue. Through the 1930s Lang kept on working for Church solidarity. In 1933 the Church of England get together shaped a Council on Foreign Relations and, in the next years, various trade visits with Orthodox appointments occurred, a procedure just stopped by the episode of war. Lang's 1939 visit to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is viewed as the high purpose of his ecumenical record. George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, kept up that nobody in the Anglican Communion accomplished more than Lang to advance the solidarity development.
