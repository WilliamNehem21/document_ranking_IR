Trimmer's more than four hundred surveys established a lot of particular and recognizable criteria in regards to what was important in this new kind. As a high-church Anglican, she was determined to shielding Christianity from secularism just as fervency, especially as the last showed itself in Methodism. Her surveys likewise uncover her to be a staunch monarchist and adversary of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, "her underlying inquiries of any kids' books that preceded her were in every case first, was it harming to religion and second, was it harming to political faithfulness and the built up social chain of importance". Religion was Trimmer's first need and her accentuation on the tenet of Biblical inerrancy represented her fundamentalism. She kept in touch with a companion: "I will just say, that the more I ponder the subject, the more I am persuaded that it isn't on the whole correct to "override" the "allegorical" style in which they discuss "God" and "perfect things", my sentiment is, that whoever endeavors to show the facts of heavenly disclosure, ought to pursue the "strategy" of the "roused scholars" as almost as could reasonably be expected" [emphasis Trimmer's]. For Trimmer, reality of the Bible was in its substance, yet additionally in its style, and a portion of her harshest surveys were composed against writings that modified both the style and the substance of the Bible.
