"Paraceratherium" is one of the largest known land mammals that have ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of complete specimens. Early estimates of are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of at maximum, and as low as on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of "P. transouralicum" because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. Its total body length was estimated as from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and by the Soviet palaeontologist Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of "Paraceratherium" was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth ("Mammuthus trogontherii"). Despite its roughly equivalent mass, "Paraceratherium" might have been taller than any proboscidean. Its shoulder height was estimated as at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but by the American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul in 1997. The neck was estimated at long by the palaeontologists Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013. "P. huangheense" differs from "P. bugtiense" only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, as well as its larger size.
