As indicated by Tammas, the nuckelavee has a man's middle joined to a steed's back as though it were a rider. The male middle has no legs, yet its arms can achieve the ground from its situation over the equine body, the legs of which have balance like limbs. The middle has an extensive headÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ conceivably as much as in diameterÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that moves forward and backward. The beast depicted by Tammas has two heads; the equine head has a colossal expanding mouth that radiates a malodorous poisonous vapor, and a solitary mammoth eye like a consuming red fire.
