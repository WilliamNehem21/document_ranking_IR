Among its other influences on popular culture, "Pinafore" had perhaps its most profound influence on the development of musical theatre. According to theatre historian John Kenrick, "Pinafore" "became an international sensation, reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States." The music writer Andrew Lamb notes, "The success of "H.M.S. Pinafore" in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French opÃ©ra bouffe throughout the English-speaking world". The historian John Bush Jones opines that "Pinafore" and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre "can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value" and that "Pinafore" created the model for a new kind of musical theatre, the "integrated" musical, where "book, lyrics, and music combined to form an integral whole". He adds that its "unprecedentedÂ ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre, while the show itself became a model for form, content, and even intention ofÂ ... musicals ever since, especially socially relevant musicals." Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of "Pinafore" described above, musicals in which the story line involves a production of "Pinafore" and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music. Other examples include "The Pirates of Pinafore", "The Pinafore Pirates" (which Bradley calls "splendid" and describes in detail in Bradley (2005), pp.Â 174â75), "Mutiny on the Pinafore", and "H.M.S. Dumbledore" (2004) by Caius Marcius.</ref> The first such parody was a short-lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882, called "The Wreck of the Pinafore" by H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle; the opera's characters are shipwrecked on a desert island. It was described by "The Era" as "chiefly remarkable for its impudence".
