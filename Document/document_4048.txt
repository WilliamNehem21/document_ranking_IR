Ten of the eleven protected shipper naval force's wound up at Barry Scrapyard with one motor, 35028 "Family Line" being purchased by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society direct from British Railways administration in 1967, and has since been viewed as the 'leader' of the class. Albeit eleven individuals from the class have made due into the safeguarding time, all things considered, many will never steam again, with just five having kept running in conservation up to this point. This is on the grounds that the class is excessively expansive and substantial for use on the majority of the present legacy railroads. As the whole class was modified from 1956 onwards, no Merchant Navy class trains exist in as-manufactured condition, in spite of the fact that a group are endeavoring to figure out 35011 "General Steam Navigation" to unique condition. Different relics of the class have made due in the appearance of train nameplates and smokebox number plates, which were taken from their trains towards the finish of steam on the British Railways Southern Region during the 1960s. Thus, many exist in private accumulations and a few have been seen at sell-offs, selling for a few a large number of pounds.
