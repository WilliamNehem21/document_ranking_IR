Wooly mammoths had long tusks (altered incisor teeth), which were more bended than those of present day elephants. The biggest realized male tusk is long and weighs , yet and was an increasingly common size. Female tusks were littler and more slender, and gauging . The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and separated intently. About a fourth of the length was inside the attachments. The tusks developed spirally in inverse ways from the base and proceeded in a bend until the tips pointed towards one another, occasionally crossing. Along these lines, a large portion of the weight would have been near the skull, and less torque would happen than with straight tusks. The tusks were normally unbalanced and indicated significant variety, with certain tusks bending down rather than outwards and some being shorter because of breakage. Calves grew little milk tusks a couple of centimeters long at a half year old, which were supplanted by lasting tusks a year later. Tusk development proceeded all through life, however turned out to be slower as the creature achieved adulthood. The tusks developed by every year. Some cavern artworks show wooly mammoths with little or no tusks, yet whether this reflected reality or was aesthetic permit is obscure. Female Asian elephants have no tusks, however no fossil proof demonstrates that any grown-up wooly mammoths needed them.
