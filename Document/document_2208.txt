The sharp foramina, which puncture the sense of taste between the incisors and the molars, are short and don't reach close to the principal molars; they are longer in "T.ÃÂ hylophilus". They are most extensive where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The sense of taste itself is likewise short, not reaching out past the third molars, and is wide and needs edges or notches. There are straightforward posterolateral palatal pits at the back of the sense of taste, close to the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening situated behind the finish of the sense of taste, is expansive and its rooftop is either completely hardened or punctured by little sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid swagger isolates two foramina (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The example of scores and foramina on the head shows that the flow of the courses in the head of "T.ÃÂ ucucha" pursues the crude example. The tegmen tympani, the top of the tympanic hole, covers the suspensory procedure of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular procedure to get the foundation of the lower incisor, which is missing in "T.ÃÂ hylophilus".
