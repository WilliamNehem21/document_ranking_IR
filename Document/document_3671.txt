By the mid-1960s Harrison had turned into an admirer of Indian culture and otherworldliness, acquainting it with the different Beatles. Amid the taping of "Help!" in the Bahamas, they met the originator of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave every one of them a marked duplicate of his book, "The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga". Between the finish of the last Beatles visit in 1966 and the start of the "Sgt Pepper" recording sessions, he made a journey to India with his significant other Pattie; there, he considered sitar with Ravi Shankar, met a few masters, and visited different blessed spots. In 1968 he headed out to Rishikesh in northern India with the different Beatles to ponder contemplation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's utilization of hallucinogenic medications urged his way to contemplation and Hinduism. He remarked: "For me, it resembled a glimmer. The first occasion when I had corrosive, it simply opened up something in my mind that was within me, and I understood a ton of things. I didn't learn them since I definitely knew them, however that happened to be the key that opened the way to uncover them. From the minute I had that, I needed to have it constantly Ã¢ÂÂ these considerations about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."
