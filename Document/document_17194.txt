Maurice Richardson, of "The Observer", considered the novel "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in "The Manchester Guardian" referred to Johnson's "sex, snobbery and sadism" complaint. They highlighted the "sinisterÂ ... cult of luxury for its own sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel was a sign of moral decay; rather, "we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." This reviewer also conceded that while "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to "The Manchester Guardian" in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of "Dr. No" and the article in "The Twentieth Century". Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices "vulgar foibles" which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies."
