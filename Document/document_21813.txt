The graphic depiction of violence in "The Last of Us" generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives. "Kotaku"s Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of "Computer and Video Games" stated that, despite the "incredibly brutal" combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. "Eurogamer"s Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of "Game Informer" observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of "The Guardian" wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game.
