"Chesma" joined the Allied armada off Salamis requesting the demilitarization of the Greek armada soon thereafter and left after the Greeks consented to satisfy the Allied needs. Her apparatus was updated at Birkenhead by Cammell Laird, starting on 5 December, and her primary deck six-inch and 12-pounder weapons were evacuated. In return she got four enemy of airplane firearms mounted on her superstructure. She touched base at Aleksandrovsk, a port in the Murmansk Oblast, on 16 January 1917 and the political circumstance turned out to be extremely mistaken for the February Revolution not long after her entry. She was alloted to the White Sea Fleet on 3 February. Her team proclaimed for the Bolsheviks in October, yet tried to meddle with the Allied arriving at Murmansk in March 1918. In spite of the fact that the ship was regarded "on solid land and unseaworthy" by the British without further ado subsequently, they caught the ship and utilized her as a skimming jail in April 1919 to house 40 Bolshevik detainees. After the British pulled back, the surrendered ship was caught by the Red Army in March 1920 and consolidated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla on 24 April. No longer of any military esteem, she was swung over to the port of Archangelsk on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the rundown of maritime vessels on 3 July 1924, after which she was rejected.
