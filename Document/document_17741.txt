"Armageddon", released in 1998, established Affleck as a viable leading man for Hollywood studio films. "Good Will Hunting" had not yet been released during the casting process and, after Affleck's screen test, director Michael Bay dismissed him as "a geek". He was convinced by producer Jerry Bruckheimer that Affleck would be a star, but the actor was required to lose weight, become tanned, and get his teeth capped before filming began. The film, where he starred opposite Bruce Willis as a blue-collar driller tasked by NASA with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, was a box office success. Daphne Merkin of "The New Yorker" remarked: "Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom." Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy "Shakespeare in Love", starring his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow. Lael Loewenstein of "Variety" remarked that Affleck "does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling," while Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" found him "very funny". "Shakespeare in Love" won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film "Phantoms". Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" wondered why actors like Affleck and Peter O'Toole had agreed to appear in the "junky" film: "Affleck's thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards."
