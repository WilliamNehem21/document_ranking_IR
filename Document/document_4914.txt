Simply outside the dividers of the city, on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane, was discovered a progression of interlocking patio structures, of which the biggest contained a hammam, or shower. This is a L-molded structure, with a virus room cleared with flagstones and seats running at the edges. Toward the end is discovered a dive pool with three stages driving into it. From the virus room one moved to a vestibule at the edge of the structure, finished with a help of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From that point, one moved into the warm room, still secured by a vault, lastly into the hot room. The vault of this has now been reestablished, however it is conceivable to see the directs in the floor through which the tourist passed. Past this a heater warmed the room, just as the boiling water which would have streamed into bowls in the corners. The patio of which this hammam shaped as far as possible was huge, and contained various substantial storehouses for grain stockpiling. Toward the south of this patio was one obviously intended for gathering, with long thin rooms toward the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low seat or divan toward one side. Further south a third yard, just halfway unearthed, appears to have been dedicated to household use. The arrangement, with its vast patios and tight rooms, is altogether different from the contemporary a couple stayed structures inside the dividers, most likely occupied by the Berbers of the Awraba clan. It is dated by coins and earthenware to the rule of Idris I, and has been recognized as his central station .
