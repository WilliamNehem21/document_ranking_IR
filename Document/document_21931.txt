The climactic sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan has been compared to the fight in the 1894 novel, "The Prisoner of Zenda". In 1976, American film historian William K. Everson compared the comedians in "Chandralekha" to Laurel and Hardy. Although Randor Guy considers the film's drum-dance scene the first of its kind in Indian cinema, the 1947 film "Naam Iruvar" includes a scene when the lead actress' younger sister dances on drums to the Tamil poet Subramania Bharati's "Kottu Murase"; French film historian Yves Thoraval wrote that it "prefigured the dance that "Chandralekha" made famous the very next year." According to American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, the film "belongs to the same childhood continuum" as Fritz Lang's 1959 films "The Tiger of Eschnapur" and "The Indian Tomb" (which were set in India). In his 2009 book, "50 Indian Film Classics", film critic M. K. Raghavendra wrote that "Chandralekha" was constructed in a manner which "enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre." According to Guy, the setting of the song "Naattiya Kuthirai" with Sundari Bai (including her dance and costume) were inspired by the 1943 musical film "Coney Island". Film scholar Uma Vangal wrote that the film reflects Vasan's "vision of a truly democratic nation, based on equal rights for men and women" by portraying "a world where men and women work together to establish a rightful rule".
