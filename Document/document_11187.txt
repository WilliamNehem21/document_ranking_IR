The scene's last minutes wait on Dean "meat-snared in the focal point of what resembles a thousand mile spiderweb of corroded chains", a scene Kripke depicted as "M. C. Escher meets "Hellraiser"". The first vision for the last scene would have put Dean in an "extremely awful, bleeding slaughterhouse, dangling from meat snares". Here, Dean would begin shouting as shadows fall over him. Dialogs between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden prompted the choice to show "one epic look" of Hell, however they kept away from angles, for example, flame and brimstone to concentrate on progressively reasonable visuals. Much discussion went into the presence of Hell in light of its numerous varieties. In spite of the fact that the scene coordinated with the numerous adaptations of "chains and individuals being tore separated", craftsmanship chief John Marcynuk felt they ought to have made it "somewhat more secretive and dull". He remarked, "My supposition is, the vaguer the better, since you let the creative energy dominate. Individuals have diverse feelings of dread, and Hell's such an individual torment." In arrangement author Sera Gamble's assessment, Dean's area is a greater amount of the "lounge area"Ã¢ÂÂ the spot "they stick you before they give you the sign-in sheet"Ã¢ÂÂ a long ways from what he will encounter "once he gets into the primary council of Hell".
