The fine art in "Shocking" was at first very poor, which was obvious given the minute spending plan Pohl needed to work with. A significant part of the craftsmanship was provided by fans and specialists from the get-go in their vocations, including Doris Baumgardt (under the nom de plume Perri) and Dorothy Les Tina, who later turned into Pohl's first and second spouses, individually. One fan craftsman who emerged from the rest was Hannes Bok, who proceeded to turn into an all around regarded craftsman with a particular style. Beam Bradbury remarked decidedly on Bok's work in a letter in the August 1940 "Surprising", and Bok thusly delineated an account of Bradbury's in the April 1943 issue. Aleck Portegal, Popular's craft executive, had at first revealed to Pohl that the customary craftsmen would be reluctant to work for the low rates he could offer, yet in the occasion some of them were eager to take less pay to get the additional work. Increasingly proficient craftsmanship started to show up in the magazine, including work by Virgil Finlay, Alexander Leydenfrost, Leo Morey, Hans Wessolowski, and Frank R. Paul, all notable in the field. Some workmanship showed up under the name Stephen Lawrence, which was known to be a pen name Lawrence Stevens, yet it was along these lines found that a portion of this work was quite Lawrence Stevens' child Peter.
