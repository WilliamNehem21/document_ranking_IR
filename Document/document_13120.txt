Writers Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown talk about misinterpretations about the Xenu message in their book "World Religions at Your Fingertips", and watch, "Presumably the most questionable, misjudged, and every now and again distorted piece of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology fantasy ordinarily alluded to as the Legend of Xenu. While this story has now been without a doubt demonstrated a piece of the religion (in spite of the way that congregation agents regularly deny its reality), the story's actual job in Scientology is frequently distorted by its commentators as confirmation that they 'have faith in outsider parasites.' While the story may undoubtedly appear to be odd, this is basically not the situation." The writers compose that "The story is really intended to be a working fantasy, showing the Scientology conviction that people were at one time otherworldly creatures, existing on boundless dimensions of intergalactic and interdimensional substances. Sooner or later, the creatures that we used to be wound up caught in physical reality (where we stay right up 'til today). This should be the basic message of the Xenu story, not that people are "controlled by outsiders". McDowell and Brown presume that these unseemly misguided judgments about the Xenu content have had a negative effect, "Such brutal explanations are the reason numerous Scientologists presently become energetically insulted at even the notice of Xenu by nonmembers."
