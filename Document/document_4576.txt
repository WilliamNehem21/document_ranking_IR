Among Arabs, the 717Ã¢ÂÂ 718 attack turned into the most popular of their endeavors against Byzantium. A few records endure, yet most were made at later dates and are semi-anecdotal and opposing. In legend, the thrashing was changed into a triumph: Maslama withdrew simply after emblematically entering the Byzantine capital on his steed joined by thirty riders, where Leo got him with respect and drove him to the Hagia Sophia. After Leo paid respect to Maslama and guaranteed tribute, Maslama and his troopsÃ¢ÂÂ30,000 out of the first 80,000 that set out for ConstantinopleÃ¢ÂÂleft for Syria. The stories of the attack affected comparative scenes in Arabic epic writing. An attack of Constantinople is found in the story of Omar container al-Nu'uman and his children in the "Thousand and One Nights", while both Maslama and the Caliph Sulayman show up in a story of the "Hundred and One Nights" from the Maghreb. The administrator of Maslama's protector, Abdallah al-Battal, turned into a commended figure in Arab and Turkish verse as "Battal Gazi" for his endeavors in the Arab assaults of the following decades. So also, the tenth century epic "Delhemma", identified with the cycle around Battal, gives a fictionalized variant of the 717Ã¢ÂÂ 718 attack.
