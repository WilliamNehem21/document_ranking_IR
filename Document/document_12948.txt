An audit distributed in "The Times" not long after the book's production depicted it as an "enchanting philosophical story", and in his paper the student of history and instructor Bob Barker applauded the novel for being "momentous for its cool yet clear style". Commentator Orville Prescott, writing in "The New York Times", in spite of the fact that conceding that the novel was "flawlessly expressed" and "a triumph of sensitive and suggestive confusion", by and by inferred that the story was "absurd" and "vexatious". He finished his survey with the words: "One feels continually that sparkling realities are going to be uncovered; that there is something critical, something huge, covered up in these pages. In any case, it is never clarified, while the ludicrous subtleties stay very prominently in view." Prescott was similarly as condemning of Rexroth's prelude to the principal American version, depicting it as a "self-absorbed presentation of remarkable thickness". Writing in "The Independent" in 1993, soon after the 100th commemoration of Read's introduction to the world, commentator Geoffrey Wheatcroft remarked that Read might not have been an incredible author "yet "The Green Child" is the sort of book to compose in the event that you are going to leave only the one novel behind: particular, odd, totally unique".
