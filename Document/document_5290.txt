Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, in their "Compact Dictionary of Australian Artists", believed Fuller's specialty to be made in "a free painterly style obligated to Impressionism". Amid the primary decade of the twentieth century, audits attracted regard for her particularly Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was incorporated into a presentation of frontier specialists in London (counting canvases from Canada and Australia), the reporter from the "Adelaide Advertiser" portrayed Fuller's commitment as "most Australian in inclination". Inspecting her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth faultfinder announced: "Of the 16 or 17 Australian craftsmen showing at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the special case who picked a normally Australian scene. Her image demonstrates a young lady in slight white, sticking, dress, remaining on a shaggy bit of countryÃÂ ... As the London "Eyewitness" says, the air that washes the effortless figure of the young lady is capitally made do with its note of subtropical warmth". One analyst respected her representations, however was less persuaded about Fuller's way to deal with the Australian light, writing:She had less accomplishment with our scenes than with her figure subjects. That was the consequence of her energy for conditioning her photos for extreme indoor hanging. Consequently she lost, or enlightened, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and alarming relative qualities. Noticeable also was the impact of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never might she be able to force herself to see our trees as diminish hued as they for the most part may be.
