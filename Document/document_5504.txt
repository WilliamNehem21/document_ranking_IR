"Sardines" was composed with the goal that a sentiment of claustrophobia would create as the story advanced; Pemberton said that "our first thought was, 'Would we be able to get 12 individuals in a closet?' So when we did the content read-through, the architect paid a closet off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the entryway". Journalists for "Communicate" depicted seeing the combination of performers "packed inside a monumental closet" amid shooting as "a capturing exhibition". The story is shot from inside a solitary room, with a lot of it occurring inside the closet. Taping exhibited a specific test, as the point was to give the feeling that the watcher was in the closet with the characters, and not to "cheat" by giving the feeling that the watcher was outside the closet looking in. The scene was taped with two closets; one complete one, and one "faked" one. The total prop was utilized to film the characters entering the closet, while the other was in an alternate space for close-up shots from "inside" the closet. For executive David Kerr, the trouble was continuing the figment that everything was going on in a solitary spot, in a perfect world without watchers notwithstanding understanding that there was a specialized test included. The scene was shot generally in succession, which means more performers touched base as the shooting kept, mirroring the way that more characters land as the scene advances. Kerr went for an especially "vivid" taping style on the scene, with broad utilization of wide point shots. He intended to abstain from "driving" the gathering of people with respect to the more essential characters, by, for example, "not giving [them] inclusion" prior in the scene.
