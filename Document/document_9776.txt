Lekson trusts that Chetro Ketl was in all likelihood not involved by scores of families, and in that sense was not a pueblo as early archeologists had closed. He additionally takes note of that, while most if not all round rooms in the gulch have customarily been marked as kivas, the littler ones found at Chetro Ketl were in all probability not kivas, "however the last and most expand type of the pit-house", which had filled in as the locale's essential lodging structure amid the five hundred years preceding the settlement of Chaco Canyon. He suggested that Chacoan incredible houses were imperial castles; Chetro Ketl was a home for the first class, yet in addition a focal area for administration, stockpiling, craftworks, custom, and organization. Numerous researchers differ in light of the fact that they expect "castles suggest states", and "it is commonly acknowledged that no Native state at any point existed" north of Mexico. As he would like to think, the view that royal residences can't exist outside states is confused, and social orders like Chaco may have accomplished practically identical political multifaceted nature on a littler than run of the mill scale. He considers the political "glass celling" a "practically supremacist" leftover of early archeologists who accepted Native American political modernity was, by definition, constrained to "chiefdoms" and not equipped for achieving statehood.
