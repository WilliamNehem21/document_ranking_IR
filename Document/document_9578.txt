The Danish humanist Benedikte Brincker sees that the view of Nielsen and his music in his nation of origin is somewhat not quite the same as his global appreciation. His advantage and foundation in society music had exceptional reverberation for Danes, and this was escalated amid the nationalistic developments of the 1930s and amid World War II, when singing was an imperative reason for the Danes to separate themselves from their German adversaries. Nielsen's tunes hold an imperative spot in Danish culture and instruction. The musicologist Niels Krabbe depicts the prominent picture of Nielsen in Denmark as resembling "the odd one out disorder" Ã¢ÂÂ a reference to the story of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen Ã¢ÂÂ whereby "a poor boyÃÂ ... going through difficulty and frugalityÃÂ ... walks into Copenhagen andÃÂ ... comes to overcome the situation as the uncrowned King". Along these lines while outside Denmark Nielsen is to a great extent thought of as the writer of instrumental music and the musical drama "Maskarade", in his own nation he is all the more a national image. These opposite sides were formally united in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a rundown of the twelve biggest Danish melodic works, which included three by Nielsen Ã¢ÂÂ "Maskarade", the Fourth Symphony, and a couple of his Danish tunes. Krabbe makes the logical inquiry: "Can 'the national' in Nielsen be exhibited in the music as specific subjects, harmonies, sounds, frames, and so forth., or is it an unadulterated build of gathering history?"
