On 8 February 1916, Weathers enrolled as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and was at first designated as a support to the tenth Battalion. In June he was exchanged to the 43rd Battalion, some portion of the eleventh Brigade, third Division. The 43rd Battalion set out on HMAT "Afric" in June 1916, and after a concise stop in the Middle East and travel through France, spent the remainder of the year preparing at Larkhill on the Salisbury Plain in southern England. The third Division set out for the Western Front in November, and entered the channels without precedent for late December. Climates revealed wiped out in late January 1917, and did not rejoin his unit until late April. He came back to the bleeding edges so as to partake in the main significant activity his unit found in the war, the Battle of Messines, amid which the 43rd Battalion brought about 122 losses in an evening time task to catch the last goal, the Oosttaverne Line. One of those setbacks was Weathers, who endured a shot injury to the leg on 10 June. Emptied to emergency clinic in the United Kingdom, he didn't come back to his unit until early December. The third Division spent the winter of 1917Ã¢ÂÂ 1918 pivoting through the bleeding edges in the Messines area of the Flanders district of Belgium, to a great extent improving the channels against a normal German hostile in the spring.
