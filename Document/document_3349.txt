From the association's establishment, the Romney Literary Society continuously started to perceive that the neighborhood membership educational systems gave just basic and frequently fragmentary instruction and never again fulfilled the scholastic needs of the Romney people group. The general public intermittently occupied with protracted consultations on which hypotheses of instructive progression and prevalent training were best. Not long after its foundation, the general public started a development to set up an organization for "the advanced education of the adolescent of the network." In 1820, because of this activity, the instructing of the works of art was brought into the educational modules of Romney Academy, along these lines making the establishment the primary school of advanced education in the Eastern Panhandle. Under the direction, initiative, and exacting control of Dr. Henry Johnston, Romney Academy turned out to be generally famous for its courses in "higher works of art." His successor and society part William Henry Foote presented courses in religious philosophy, and the school's enlistment developed to incorporate understudies getting ready for service. As the school turned out to be progressively eminent in the South Branch Potomac River valley, understudies originated from further and further away. Thomas Mulledy and Samuel Mulledy were among the early teachers at the foundation, both of whom later filled in as leaders of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
