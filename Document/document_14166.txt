Prior to World War II, most school groups were military-style and only male. At the point when the war started, most band individuals left to serve in the military, which enormously stressed the cliqueÃ¢ÂÂto the point that 90 percent of parts were compelled to suspend exercises. The Grand Council conceded those parts that were compelled to suspend their exercises "war vacation" so that as opposed to regarding the section as dormant, their administration would be respected. War leave of absence empowered a part to seal its records and keep its materials in protection for the span of the war. Petitions for war leave required the marks of every single dynamic part, the chief of groups or other employee who was a privileged individual from the organization, just as the mark of the school or college president. Just five sections stayed dynamic amid the war: the Alpha part at Oklahoma A&M College, Alpha Beta at Butler University, Alpha Iota at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Alpha Omicron at Texas Technological College, and Alpha Pi at the University of Tulsa. With such a large number of individuals serving abroad, including individuals from the Grand Council, the 1943 and 1945 national traditions were dropped.
