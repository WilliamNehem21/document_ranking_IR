Like most other Proteaceae, "B.Â integrifolia" has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Studies on "B.Â integrifolia" suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment.
"B.Â integrifolia" flowers have an unusually short life span for "Banksia" species, producing nectar for only about four to twelve days after anthesis. Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced all through the year, but there is a strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of insects; many species of bird including "Phylidonyris novaehollandiae" (New Holland honeyeater), "Anthochaera carunculata" (red wattlebird), "Anthochaera chrysoptera" (little wattlebird), "Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris" (eastern spinebill) and "Trichoglossus haematodus" (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as "Petaurus norfolcensis" (squirrel glider), "Petaurus breviceps" (sugar glider), "Acrobates pygmaeus" (feathertail glider) and "Pteropus poliocephalus" (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, "B.Â integrifolia" is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (MarchâApril) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of "B.Â integrifolia" was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in Wilsons Promontory National Park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.
