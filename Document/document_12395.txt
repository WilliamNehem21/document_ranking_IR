When they reach Zanarkand, YunalescaÃ¢ÂÂthe first summoner to overcome Sin and unsent from that point forwardÃ¢ÂÂtells the gathering that the Final Eon is made from the fayth of one near the summoner. Subsequent to crushing Sin, the Final Eon executes the summoner and changes into another Sin, which has made its cycle of resurrection proceed. Yuna rules against utilizing the Final Eon, because of the vain penances it conveys and the way that Sin would even now be reawakened. Frustrated by their goals, Yunalesca attempts to murder Tidus' gathering, yet she is crushed and evaporates, finishing any expectation of consistently achieving the Final Eon. After the battle, the gathering discovers that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his mankind and brain, is behind Sin's cycle of resurrection. This leads the gathering to invade Sin's body to fight Seymour, and Jecht's detained soul. With Sin's host crushed, Tidus' gathering vanquishes Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of resurrection closes, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are liberated from their detainment. Auron, who had been uncovered to be unsent, is sent to the Farplane. Dream Zanarkand and Tidus vanish, presently that the liberated fayth halted the calling. A short time later, in a discourse to the residents of Spira, Yuna takes steps to help reconstruct their reality since it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus stirs submerged. He at that point swims towards the sea surface, and the screen blurs to white.
