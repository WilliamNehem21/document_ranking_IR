A Canadian release of "Odd Tales" showed up from June 1935 to July 1936; each of the fourteen issues are believed to be indistinguishable to the U.S. issues of those dates, however "Imprinted in Canada" showed up on the spread, and in somewhere around one case another content box was set on the spread to hide some portion of a bare figure. Another Canadian arrangement started in 1942, because of import confinements put on U.S. magazines. Canadian releases from 1942 up to January 1948 were not indistinguishable to the U.S. releases, yet they coordinate firmly enough that the firsts are effectively recognized. From the May 1942 to January 1945 issues, they relate to the U.S. versions two issues prior, that is, from January 1942 to September 1944. There was no Canadian issue comparing to the November 1944 U.S. issue, so starting there the Canadian issues were just a single behind the U.S. ones: the issues from March 1945 to January 1948 compare to the U.S. issues from January 1945 to November 1947. There was no Canadian issue of the January 1948 U.S. issue, and from the following issue, March 1948, till the finish of the Canadian keep running in November 1951, the issues were indistinguishable to the U.S. forms.
