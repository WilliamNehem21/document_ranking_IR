Paper response to the outcome was by and large along factional lines. The "Cincinnati Commercial Tribune", a Republican paper, expressed of Hanna, "And this is the man against whom has been pursued a war than which political history outfits none progressively venomous, awful, and persistently vituperative. It is a shameful story, known about all men." "The Blade", another Republican paper, concurred, stating, "The battle against Mr. Hanna was the most threateningly traitorous challenge at any point pursued in the political chronicles of Ohio." "The Cincinnati Enquirer", a Silver Democratic paper, contended, "The Republican unexpected which adhered to the last against Hanna has made a record which the successful group may well envyÃÂ ... Their battle wasÃÂ ... against the executive of the national advisory group and every one of its powers and assets; against the leader of the United States, with his huge gathering impact and progressively compelling support. Against this they have chopped down the man who a year back was, by the president, the main Republican of the United States, to a miserable dominant part of one in his desire to be chosen to the Senate, and that got under conditions not noteworthy to him. They pursued him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges examined." Hearst's New York "Diary" noted, "Thus it is to be 'Congressperson Hanna' for a long time. All things considered, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's capacity for malevolence. For whatever length of time that Hanna has his cash he can control senatorships, regardless of whether he possesses them or not. Maybe it is ideal to have him in the open."
