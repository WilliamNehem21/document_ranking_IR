Heseltine spent a significant part of the 1915 summer in a leased occasion bungalow in the Vale of Evesham, with a gathering that incorporated a youthful craftsman's model named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as "Jaguar" as a result of her unpredictable personality. She and Heseltine before long went into an energetic relationship. Amid this mid year break Heseltine stunned neighbors by his uninhibited conduct, which included riding a bike exposed down adjacent Crickley Hill. In any case, his letters demonstrate that as of now he was frequently discouraged and unreliable, coming up short on any reasonable feeling of direction. In November 1915 his life increased some driving force when he met D. H. Lawrence and the pair found a prompt affinity. Heseltine announced Lawrence to be "the best abstract virtuoso of his age", and energetically fell in with the essayist's arrangements to establish an Utopian province in America. In late December he pursued the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he attempted, unavailingly, to set up a distributing organization with them. Interests among Heseltine and Puma had in the interim cooled; when she uncovered that she was pregnant, Heseltine trusted to Delius that he had small preference for her and had no aim of helping her to bring up this undesirable youngster.
