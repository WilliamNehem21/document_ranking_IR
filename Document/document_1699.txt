At the point when Alexandria harbor had demonstrated lacking for his armada, Brueys had assembled his skippers and talked about their alternatives. Bonaparte had requested the armada to grapple in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and uncovered harbor, yet had enhanced the requests with the recommendation that, if Aboukir Bay was excessively perilous, Brueys could cruise north to Corfu, leaving just the vehicles and a bunch of lighter warships at Alexandria. Brueys won't, in the conviction that his squadron could give basic help to the French armed force on shore, and called his chiefs on board his 120-weapon lead "Situate" to talk about their reaction should Nelson find the armada in its harbor. Regardless of vocal restriction from Contre-amiral Armand Blanquet, who demanded that the armada would be best ready to react in vast water, the remainder of the commanders concurred that tying down in a line of fight inside the narrows exhibited the most grounded strategy for defying Nelson. It is conceivable that Bonaparte imagined Aboukir Bay as a brief port: on 27 July, he communicated the desire that Brueys had just exchanged his boats to Alexandria, and after three days, he issued orders for the armada to make for Corfu in anticipation of maritime tasks against the Ottoman regions in the Balkans, in spite of the fact that Bedouin partisans captured and killed the messenger conveying the directions.
