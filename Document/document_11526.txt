In 1929, the state chose to assemble another detour of the focal part through Piru Canyon, and to overhaul the northern bit over Tejon Pass and down the slope at Grapevine. This Ridge Route Alternate, or Ridge Alternate Highway, abbreviated the course by and expanded the base bend sweep from . This was done over concerns with respect to the security of the street, which had a high number of car crashes, just as the roadway's expanded use. The old parkway was to be surrendered to Los Angeles County, and consolidated into the province street framework. Development started in 1930, and the street south of Tejon Pass was authoritatively opened on October 29, 1933; substitution of the Grapevine level was finished by 1936. The street, which incorporated an inside "suicide" passing path, cost $3.5ÃÂ million (about $ in ), paid for by the state gas charge. It was assessed that it would pay itself off in 2.5ÃÂ years with the investment funds in time and gas. Another detour of the Newhall Tunnel, through Weldon Canyon, had been opened on May 28, 1930, accordingly giving drivers a superior course right from Los Angeles to Bakersfield. The roadway was broadened to a freeway by 1952 at an expense of $13.5ÃÂ million (about $ in ), giving two paths toward every path and an inside middle, however holding at-level crossing points.
