Some quick bowlers explored different avenues regarding leg hypothesis before 1932, at times going with the strategy with short-pitched bowling. In 1925, Australian Jack Scott initially bowled a type of what might later have been called bodyline in a state coordinate for New South Wales; his commander Herbie Collins despised it and would not give him a chance to utilize it once more. Other Australian commanders were less specific, including Vic Richardson who let Scott utilize those strategies when he moved to South Australia. He rehashed them against the MCC in 1928Ã¢ÂÂ 29. In 1927, in a Test preliminary match, "Nobby" Clark bowled short to a leg-trap (a group of defenders put close on the leg side). He was speaking to England in a side captained by Douglas Jardine. In 1928Ã¢ÂÂ 29, Harry Alexander bowled quick leg hypothesis at an England group, and Harold Larwood quickly utilized a comparative strategy on that equivalent visit in two Test matches. Freddie Calthorpe, the England chief, reprimanded Learie Constantine's utilization of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field in a Test coordinate in 1930; one such ball struck Andy Sandham, however Constantine just returned to increasingly regular strategies after an objection from the England group.
