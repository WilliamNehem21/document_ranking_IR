The police found a dispersed trail of blood that prompted the seventh floor of Block 12. Venturing into the basic passage from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira saw a varied blend of religious images (a cross, a mirror, and a blade edge) on the passageway of the principal level (unit number 467F). The proprietor of the level, Adrian Lim, moved toward the overseer and presented himself, educating Pereira that he was living there with his better half, Tan Mui Choo, and a sweetheart, Hoe Kah Hong. Allowed by Lim to look through his level, the police discovered hints of blood. Lim at first attempted to pass the stains off as flame wax, yet when tested guaranteed they were chicken blood. After the police discovered pieces of paper composed with the dead youngsters' close to home subtleties, Lim endeavored to relieve doubts by guaranteeing that Ghazali had gone to his level looking for treatment for a draining nose. He prudently expelled hair from under a floor covering and endeavored to flush it down the latrine, yet the police ceased him; crime scene investigation later decided the hair to be Ng's. Mentioning a record verification on Lim, Pereira got word from neighborhood officers that the medium was as of now engaged with an assault examination. Lim caught them and ended up upset, raising his voice at the law implementers. His rage was impersonated by Hoe as she motioned fiercely and yelled at the officers. Their activities further raised the agents' doubts that the trio were profoundly engaged with the homicides. The police gathered the proof, fixed the level as a wrongdoing scene, and brought Lim and the two ladies in to be interrogated.
