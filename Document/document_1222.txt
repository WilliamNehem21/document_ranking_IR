Because of requests for more aircrew to satisfy Australia's duties to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying preparing experienced real changes in 1951Ã¢ÂÂ 52, the prospectus at No.ÃÂ 1 FTS being part among three independently found units. No.ÃÂ 1 Initial Flying Training School (No.ÃÂ 1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to grant understudies with general aeronautical and military information, after which they got their flight evaluating amid twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.ÃÂ 1 IFTS went on to the recently shaped No.ÃÂ 1 Basic Flying Training School (No.ÃÂ 1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they experienced a further 90 hours of ethereal guidance that included instrument, arrangement and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and after that on Wirraways. Effective understudies at long last exchanged to No.ÃÂ 1 FTS, which was renamed No.ÃÂ 1 Applied Flying Training School (No.ÃÂ 1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they attempted 100 flying long periods of cutting edge weapons and battle preparing on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots. RAAF College, shaped at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's essential wellspring of appointed officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.ÃÂ 1 BFTS were accordingly supplanted by the CAC Winjeel, first conveyed in 1955.
