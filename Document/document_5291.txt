As a result of a potential obligation for ÃÂ£10,000 of redesign work upon the expiry of the rent, Betjeman considered the house too expensive to even think about maintaining, and thusly emptied it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood void and endured vandalism and disregard. A review attempted in January 1965 uncovered that the outside stonework was gravely rotted, dry decay had eaten through the rooftop and the basic floor timbers, and the upper rooms were swarmed with pigeons. Vandals had taken the lead from the water tanks and had harmed the mirrors, chimneys and cutting work. The most outstanding misfortune was the burglary of the cut figure of "Popularity" from the Dining Room chimneypiece. Betjeman recommended that the proprietor's specialists had intentionally would not let the house, and enabled it to decay, expecting to annihilate it and redevelop the site. Writing in "Nation Life" in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took an alternate view saying that "the Ilchester Estate, whereupon the house is arranged, are on edge that it ought to be protected and [have] went into a long rent contingent upon the house being put into a condition of good fix." In March 1965, the Historic Buildings Council got a safeguarding request on the house, empowering the buyer of the rent, Lady Jane Turnbull, girl of William Gray, ninth Earl of Stamford, to start a program of rebuilding the next July. These redesigns were bolstered by awards of ÃÂ£4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and ÃÂ£3,000 from the Greater London Council. The rent was sold in 1969.
