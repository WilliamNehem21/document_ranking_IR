This Bull was affirmed by Pope Alexander's successor Pope Lucius III. Jocelin had acquired this affirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and mid 1182. He had been sent there by King William, alongside abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Kelso and the earlier of Inchcolm, so as to engage the Pope in regards to his position in a battle over the Bishopric of St Andrews and the sentence of expulsion and forbid the Pope had set over the lord and kingdom. The question concerned the race to the ward of John the Scot, which had been restricted by the ruler, who sorted out the race of his own competitor, Hugh. The mission was effective. The Pope lifted the forbid, exonerated the ruler and designated two legates to explore the issue of the St Andrews progression. The Pope even sent the ruler a Golden Rose, a thing generally given to the Prefect of Rome. The issue of the progression, in any case, did not leave. In 1186, Jocelin, alongside the abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Newbattle, banned Hugh on the guidelines of Pope Lucius. Hugh made a trip to Rome in 1188, and got exoneration, however he passed on of the plague in that city a couple of days after the fact, therefore enabling the issue to be settled.
