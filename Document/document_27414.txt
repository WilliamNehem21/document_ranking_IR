The quality of the magazine remained high even as the financial stress was mounting in the late 1970s. White acquired cover artwork by Stephen Fabian and Douglas Beekman, and stories by some of the new generation of sf writers, such as George R. R. Martin and Charles Sheffield. White departed in November 1978, but the first issue of "Fantastic" under Elinor Mavor's editorial control was April 1979. Because White had returned unsold stories she had very little to work with and was forced to fill the magazine with reprints. This led to renewed conflict with the sf community, which she did her best to defuse. At a convention in 1979 she met Harlan Ellison, who complained about the reprint policy; she explained that it was temporary and was able to get him to agree to contribute stories, publishing two pieces by him in "Amazing" over the next three years. The January 1980 issue of "Fantastic" (Mavor's fourth issue) was the last to contain reprinted stories. Once the reprints had been phased out, Mavor was able to find new writers to work with, including Brad Linaweaver and John E. Stith, both of whom sold their first stories to "Fantastic". The last year of "Fantastic" showed "a steady improvement in content", according to Mike Ashley, who cites in particular "Daemon", a serialized graphic story, illustrated by Stephen Fabian. However, at the end of 1980 "Fantastic"s independent existence ceased, and it was merged with "Amazing".
