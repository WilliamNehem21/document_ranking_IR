Garrow's first legal arrangement came in 1814, when he was made Chief Justice of Chester. This was restricted by Sir Samuel Romilly, who contended that the places of Chief Justice and Attorney General were contradictory, saying "to designate a courteous fellow holding a worthwhile office at the sole delight of the Crown to a high legal circumstance, was amazingly conflicting with that freedom of the legal character which it was so critical to protect untouched". On 6 May 1817, Garrow was made a Baron of the Exchequer and Serjeant-at-Law, succeeding Richard Richards, and leaving his seat in Parliament and his situation as Attorney General. He was not an especially recognized judge in the Exchequer, for the most part because of an absence of information of the better purposes of law. Rehearsing on the Assize Circuits, be that as it may, was an alternate issue; managing his more commonplace criminal law as opposed to the business law of the Exchequer, Garrow performed far superior. Braby shows that he routinely astonished the two lawyers and litigants with his insight into the complexities of wrongdoing. Garrow resigned on 22 February 1832, supplanted by John Gurney, and was made a Privy Councilor on retirement as a proportion of the Government's regard for him. He kicked the bucket at home on 14 September 1840, matured 80.
