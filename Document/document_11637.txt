Pat Nixon held the record as the most-voyaged First Lady until her imprint was outperformed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. In President Nixon's first term, Pat ventured out to 39 of 50 states, and in the principal year alone, shook hands with a fourth of a million people. She embraced numerous missions of generosity to remote countries too. Her first outside outing took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such outings, Pat would not be overhauled by a company, feeling that they were a pointless obstruction and a weight for citizens. Before long, amid an outing to South Vietnam, Pat turned into the main First Lady to enter a battle zone. She had tea with the spouse of President NguyÃ¡Â»Ân VÃÂn ThiÃ¡Â»Âu in a royal residence, visited a halfway house, and lifted off in an open-entryway helicopterÃ¢ÂÂequipped by military gatekeepers with automatic riflesÃ¢ÂÂto witness U.S. troops battling in a wilderness beneath. She would later confess to encountering a "snapshot of dread going into a fight zone", in light of the fact that, as writer and student of history Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, "Pat Nixon was truly in a line of shoot." She later visited a military emergency clinic, where, for two hours, she strolled through the wards and talked with each injured patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon's trek "strengthened our spirit".
