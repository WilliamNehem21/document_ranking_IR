The band was not happy with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and chose to record in Ulrich's local Denmark. Ulrich took drum exercises, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to figure out how to record all the more effectively. Ulrich was in chats with Rush's bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to deliver the collection, however the joint effort never emerged as a result of awkward calendars. Metallica recorded the collection with maker Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The composition of the considerable number of tunes with the exception of "Orion" and "The Thing That Should Not Be" was finished before the band's entry in Copenhagen. Rasmussen expressed that the band brought all around arranged demos of the tunes, and just slight changes were made to the structures in the studio. The chronicle took longer than the past collection on the grounds that Metallica had built up a feeling of compulsiveness and had higher aspirations. Metallica shunned the smooth creation and synthesizers of contemporary hard shake and overwhelming metal collections by Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. With a notoriety for drinking, the band remained calm on account days. Hammett reviewed that the gathering was "simply making another collection" at the time and "had no clue that the record would have such a scope of impact, that it proceeded to have". He likewise said that the gathering was "unquestionably topping" at the time and that the collection had "the sound of a band truly gelling, truly figuring out how to function admirably together".
