Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there seem, by all accounts, to be many "mistakes and logical inconsistencies" in records of the occasions following Beswick's passing in 1758. Many recommend that she left ÃÂ£25,000 (comparable to about ÃÂ£ starting at 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the originators of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, relying on the prerequisite that her body was kept over the ground, and that intermittently she was to be checked for indications of life. Beswick's will in any case, dated 25ÃÂ July 1757 (not exactly a year prior to her demise), states just that White was to get ÃÂ£100 (ÃÂ£ starting at 2019), and that ÃÂ£400 (ÃÂ£ starting at 2019) was to be designated for burial service costs. A few records have recommended that White was an agent of Beswick's will and that he got the ÃÂ£400 himself, from which he was allowed to keep any surplus after the memorial service costs had been paid. Having Beswick preserved subsequently enabled him to keep the entire sum. On the other hand it has been recommended that White was extensively owing debtors to Beswick, an obligation that would need to be reimbursed after the memorial service, which was maintained a strategic distance from by her preserving, however Beswick's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her agents, not White. In 1866, more than 100ÃÂ years after her demise, the subtleties of Beswick's will were all the while being debated.
