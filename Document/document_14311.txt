James Douglas represented his reprobation of "The Well" with a photo of Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking coat and necktie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was likewise wearing a straight knee-length skirt, however later "Sunday Express" articles edited the photograph so firmly that it ended up hard to tell she was not wearing pants. Corridor's style of dress was not shocking during the 1920s; short haircuts were normal, and the mix of custom fitted coats and short skirts was a perceived design, talked about in magazines as the "seriously manly" look. A few lesbians, similar to Hall, embraced varieties of the style as a method for flagging their sexuality, yet it was a code that just a couple realized how to peruse. With the debate over "The Well of Loneliness", Hall turned into the open essence of sexual reversal, and all ladies who favored manly molds went under new examination. Lesbian columnist Evelyn IronsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who considered Hall's style of dress "rather delicate" contrasted with her ownÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ said that after the distribution of "The Well", truck drivers would get down on about the road to any lady who wore a neckline and tie: "Goodness, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some respected their recently discovered perceivability: when Hall talked at a lunch get-together in 1932, the gathering of people was brimming with ladies who had imitated her look. In any case, in an investigation of lesbian ladies in Salt Lake City during the 1920s and '30s, about all lamented the production of "The Well" since it had attracted undesirable regard for them.
