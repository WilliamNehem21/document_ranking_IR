The shooting content highlights a scene in Angela's vehicle in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and excellence; the scene varied from before adaptations, which set it as a "major scene on a turnpike" in which the three observer a fender bender and see a dead body. The change was a viable choice, as the generation was behind timetable and they expected to cut expenses. The calendar called for two days to be spent recording the accident, yet just a large portion of multi day was accessible. Ball concurred, yet just if the scene could hold a line of Ricky's the place he considers having once observed a dead vagrant: "When you see something to that effect, it resembles God is taking a gander at you, only for a second. Also, in case you're watchful, you can look directly back." Jane asks: "And what do you see?" Ricky: "Magnificence." Ball stated, "They needed to cut that scene. They said it's not vital. I stated, 'You're out of your screwing mind. It's a standout amongst the most critical scenes in the movie!'ÃÂ [...] If any one line is the substance of this film, is the line." Another scene was changed to suit the loss of the turnpike grouping; set in a schoolyard, it displays a "defining moment" for Jane in that she strolls home with Ricky as opposed to running with Angela. Before the finish of shooting, the content had experienced 10 drafts.
