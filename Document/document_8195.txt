On the Sunday before his gathering with the city hall leader, somewhere in the range of 8 and 9 o'clock at night, Rykener was by Soper Lane, off Cheapside, and lookingÃ¢ÂÂas Dinshaw phrases itÃ¢ÂÂ"lady enough" to pull in the consideration of the Yorkshireman John Britby. Rykener said Britby propositioned him in Cheapside, and they went to Soper Lane. They additionally grabbed the eye of "specific officers of the city", who captured them. They were blamed for "lying by a specific slow down in Soper's Lane, submitting that wretched unmentionable and disgraceful bad habit". Rykener was cross examined in a similar female garments he had been captured in. He presented himself as "Eleanor" to the city hall leader and authorities amid these procedures. The "unmentionable" demonstration they were blamed for submitting, recommends Jeremy Goldberg, was probably butt-centric sex. There can be no conviction on this point, as, Goldberg has called attention to, the agent's language frequently comprises of what Goldberg marks "intentionally dark aversion". Rykener and Britby were questioned independently by the civic chairman, John Fresshe, and the gathered magistrates of the regular chamber. The exact date of the cross examinations is obscure; the first archive in the Common Council's Plea and Memoranda Rolls (itself, says Goldberg, just kept in a "somewhat free sequential request") can be dated just by its position promptly going before a plaint with respect to a property debate on 26 January 1395.
