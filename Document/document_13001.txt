The second-most brilliant star, the yellow-white subgiant star Alpha Trianguli (3.41) with a nearby dimmer sidekick, is otherwise called Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the summit of the triangle. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha Arietis. Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white principle succession star of ghostly kind A1Vnn of evident extent 4.00 around 112 light-years from Earth. It is around twofold the extent of and around multiple times as brilliant as the sun and turns quickly. Like Beta, it is encompassed by a dusty flotsam and jetsam circle, which has a sweep multiple times the separation of the Earth from the Sun. Lying close Gamma and shaping an optical triple framework with it are Delta and 7 Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic paired framework made out of two yellow fundamental grouping stars of comparable measurements to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars circle each other each ten days and are a simple 0.1 AU separated. This framework is the nearest in the group of stars to the Earth. Just of size 5.25, 7 Trianguli is a lot further away at around 280 light-years removed from Earth.
