When the ship was examined on 5Â November, her aviation fuel system was leaking and required repairs. Five of her aircraft were transferred to "Illustrious" for an attack on 11Â November on Taranto (Operation Judgement), whilst "Eagle" remained in Alexandria. One of "Eagle"s Swordfish was shot down by the intense Italian anti-aircraft fire. The ship covered multiple convoys to Greece and Malta during the rest of November. Six of her aircraft bombed Tripoli harbour during the night of 24/25Â November without loss. "Eagle" spent most of December in Alexandria, but her aircraft supported the ground war, most notably when they spotted for the battleships and during the bombardment of Bardia on 2Â January 1941. In mid-January, the ship covered a convoy to Greece, but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route. After her return, her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters, as "Eagle" now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of "Illustrious" by German dive bombers on 11Â January. In order to make room for the fighters, one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war. When "Eagle" was covering another convoy to Malta in mid-February, the ship carried nine Fairey Fulmars of 805 Squadron, five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish.
