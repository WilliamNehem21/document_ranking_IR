Numismatic student of history Don Taxay thought it likely that individuals from the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures had consented to help a Hawaii half dollar preceding a bill being submitted, as arrangements had just started. Enactment for such was brought into the House of Representatives by the domain's agent to Congress, Victor Stewart Kaleoaloha Houston, on December 5, 1927. It was alluded to the coinage board of trustees, of which New Jersey Congressman Randolph Perkins was the seat, and which held hearings on the bill on January 23, 1928. Representative Houston showed up in help of his bill, and to the amazement of board of trustees individuals, had gotten an announcement from Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, expressing that Mellon did not contradict the bill. More often than not, when a memorial coin was proposed, Mellon contended that an award ought to be issued. This had been the situation for the Norse-American decoration three years already; its support, advisory group part Ole J. Kvale of Minnesota, had left designs for a coin in view of Treasury Department resistance. Congressman Kvale was "especially keen on realizing what forces of influence have been practiced by the courteous fellow from Hawaii to bring out such a good report". Kvale, a Norse-American, asked, "why this victimization over two million individuals in the United States has occurred for around 35,000 whites in that Territory?"
