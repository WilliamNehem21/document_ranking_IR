Jacques started 1968 by appearing with Spike Milligan and Frank Thornton in thirteen episodes of the sketch show "The World of Beachcomber", based on the Beachcomber column in the "Daily Express" newspaper and broadcast on the BBC from January to April. Shortly after the series finished, she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show, "Howerd's Hour", on ITV. She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969, including another with Sellers, "The Magic Christian". Here she portrayed a character named Ginger, who was described as a "grotesque figure", with an "insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two". She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and Roy Castle in "Pickwick", which was based on the musical of the same name, and in "Carry On Christmas", broadcast on Christmas Eve. Although 1969 had been busy, 1970 was relatively quiet in terms of her professional output: apart from an episode of "Catweazle", she appeared alongside Willoughby Goddard in a six-episode series of "Charley's Grants". She spent May and June filming "Carry On Loving", in which she played Sophie Bliss, released in September that year. Another "Carry On" film followed in 1971, "Carry On at Your Convenience", where she played Beattie Plummer, the housebound wife of Sid Plummer, played by Sid James. In the same year she completed another series with Sykes, "Sykes and a Big, Big Show", a music and sketch programme which had six episodes, broadcast between February and April.
