They additionally kept up that it didn't compel sugarcane ranchers, who were the essential polluters, to pay enough of the expenses, and expanded the edge of what was an adequate measure of phosphorus in water from 10ÃÂ ppb to 50ÃÂ ppb. Senator Chiles at first named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, yet Douglas was so disinterested with the move it made against polluters that she kept in touch with Chiles and requested her name be stricken from it.

The SFWMD expressed that its activities have surpassed desires sooner than foreseen, by making Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) inside the EAA that contain a calcium-based substance, for example, lime shake layered among peat, and loaded up with calcareous periphyton. Early tests by the Army Corps of Engineers uncovered this strategy decreased phosphorus levels from 80ÃÂ ppb to 10ÃÂ ppb. The STAs are proposed to treat water until the phosphorus levels are low enough to be discharged into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge or different WCAs.
