Elephants have been spoken to in workmanship since Paleolithic occasions. Africa, specifically, contains many shake works of art and inscriptions of the creatures, particularly in the Sahara and southern Africa. In Asia, the creatures are portrayed as themes in Jain, Hindu and Buddhist hallowed places and sanctuaries. Elephants were regularly hard to depict by individuals with no direct involvement with them. The antiquated Romans, who kept the creatures in imprisonment, portrayed anatomically exact elephants on mosaics in Tunisia and Sicily. Toward the start of the Middle Ages when Europeans had practically zero access to the creatures, elephants were depicted progressively like dream animals. They were frequently delineated with pony or ox like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a pig; some were even given hooves. Elephants were regularly included in themes by the stonemasons of the Gothic holy places. As more elephants was sent to European rulers as blessings amid the fifteenth century, portrayals of them turned out to be progressively exact, including one made by Leonardo da Vinci. Regardless of this, a few Europeans kept on depicting them in an increasingly stylised manner. Max Ernst's 1921 surrealist painting, "The Elephant Celebes," portrays an elephant as a storehouse with a trunk-like hose jutting from it.
