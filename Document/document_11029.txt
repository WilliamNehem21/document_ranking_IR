The Special Weapons Office was abrogated in November 1946, and the Manhattan Project went with the same pattern toward the year's end. A regular citizen organization, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was made by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to assume control over the capacities and resources of the Manhattan Project, including advancement, creation and control of atomic weapons. The law accommodated a Military Liaison Committee (MLC) to exhort the AEC on military issues, and Parsons turned into a part. A joint Army-Navy association, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), was made to deal with the military parts of atomic weapons. Forests was delegated to order the AFSWP, with Parsons and Air Force Major General Roscoe C. Wilson as his agents. In this limit, Parsons squeezed for the advancement of improved atomic weapons. Amid the Operation Sandstone arrangement of atomic weapon tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948, Parsons by and by filled in as agent officer. Parsons trusted that his next presenting would be on ocean, yet he was rather sent to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in 1949. He at long last came back to ocean obligation in 1951, this time as Commander, Cruiser Division 6, regardless of having never directed a ship. Parsons and his cruisers led a voyage through the Mediterranean demonstrating the banner. He at that point progressed toward becoming Deputy Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance in March 1952.
