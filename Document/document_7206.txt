At first light on 29 June, the renegades assaulted the UstaÃÂ¡e in a town on the MostarÃ¢ÂÂ Nevesinje street. Prohaska requested assistance from Mostar, and intended to send a power from Nevesinje to help. From Mostar, an organization of the 21st Battalion was despatched to calm the UstaÃÂ¡e, who had figured out how to hold off the agitators. The Home Guard organization at that point assumed control over the post from the UstaÃÂ¡e. That day, two new forces touched base in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from Osijek and the fifteenth Battalion from Travnik. These fortifications arrived similarly as PrpiÃÂ got affirmation that Avtovac had been caught by the agitators. The staying little army in Gacko, comprising of just 20 gendarmes and 30 UstaÃÂ¡e, were holding out yet anticipating more assaults by the revolutionaries. Toward the beginning of the day, the assault by components of the tenth Battalion slowed down until the contingent administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Julije ReÃÂ¡, actually took direction of the activity, making room for the Italians. The guaranteed Italian mediation started about late morning, and around 100 trucks of Italian troopers touched base in Gacko about 17:00. As they had gone through Avtovac, the renegades had left the town and pulled back to towns toward the east. About 18:00, the tenth Battalion assuaged the blockaded gendarmes in the town school building. ZNDH flying machine from Mostar landing strip flew observation fights over the territory and dropped pamphlets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and PluÃÂ¾ine.
