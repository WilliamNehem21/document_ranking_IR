The white-bellied ocean falcon is recorded as being of "Least Concern" by the IUCN. There are an expected 10 thousand to 100 thousand people, in spite of the fact that there is by all accounts a decrease in numbers. They have turned out to be uncommon in Thailand and some different pieces of southeast Asia. They are moderately copious in Hong Kong, where the populace expanded from 39 to 57 flying creatures somewhere in the range of 2002 and 2009. A field think about on Kangaroo Island in South Australia demonstrated that settling sets in regions of high human unsettling influence (as characterized by clearing of scene and high human action) had lower reproducing achievement rates. In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, homes have been emptied as human exercises have infringed on the birds' regions. Somewhere else, the clearing of trees reasonable for settling has seen it to a great extent vanish locally, for example, the expulsion of stands of "Casuarina equisetifolia" in Visakhapatnam region in Andhra Pradesh in India. In India, home densities of around one for every 4.32ÃÂ km of coastline have been noted in Sindhudurg and one for each 3.57ÃÂ km (45 settles along 161ÃÂ km) in Ratnagiri region of Maharashtra. They additionally home on Netrani Island, where around a 100 feathered creatures were noted in 1875 (at that point known as Pigeon Island) by Allan Octavian Hume who noticed this was maybe the biggest reproducing state of the species. In 2000, the unsettling influence to the island from torpedo-terminating practices led by the Indian naval force was noted as a danger. Almost 100 homes have been noted in 2004 on this island.
