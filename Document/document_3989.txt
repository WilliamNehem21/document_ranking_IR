The third book indicates unequivocally the expanded impact of Wert, at that point Monteverdi's immediate predominant as "maestro de capella" at Mantua. Two writers overwhelm the gathering: Tasso, whose expressive verse had figured noticeably in the second book yet is here spoken to through the more epic, courageous sections from "Gerusalemme liberata", and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose stanzas had showed up sporadically in Monteverdi's prior distributions, however structure around half of the substance of the third book. Wert's impact is reflected in Monteverdi's straightforwardly current methodology, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's stanzas. Of the Guarini settings Chew expresses: "The epigrammatic styleÃÂ ... intently coordinates a lovely and melodic perfect of the periodÃÂ ... [and] frequently relies upon solid, last cadential movements, with or without the increase given by chains of suspended cacophonies". Bite refers to the setting of "Stracciami pur il center" as "a prime case of Monteverdi's unpredictable cacophony practice". Tasso and Guarini were both ordinary guests to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's relationship with them and his assimilation of their thoughts may have helped establish the frameworks of his own way to deal with the melodic shows that he would make 10 years after the fact.
