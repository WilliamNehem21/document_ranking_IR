Proceeding with their training from past seasons, Parker and Stone composed and created every scene inside the week prior to its communicate date, despite the fact that as in past seasons, just Parker was recorded as author at last credits. The team considered a rundown of scene thoughts toward the beginning of the period, however said they wanted to hold up until the last moment to begin working. Due date weight, they clarified, stimulated them as though they were completing a live show. Stone said of the training, "We sort of need that [chaos] to work. We're, similar to, 'We need to accomplish something at this moment. It's going reporting in real time in only a couple of minutes.'" For instance, three days before the communicate of the period debut, "The Ring", the content was just half-completed and the movement was fragmented. In like manner, they didn't begin take a shot at "Whale Whores" until five days before the scene publicized, and the contents for "Margaritaville" and "Pee" were both as yet being done the day preceding the scenes were first communicated. Parker and Stone said "Dead Celebrities" was an especially provoking scene to makeÃ¢ÂÂthey were up throughout the night taking a shot at it the day preceding it publicized, and did not complete until 11ÃÂ a.m. on its communicate date. A few faultfinders have said that this short turnaround process enables "South Park" to remain new and enables the show to address recent developments in a convenient manner.
