As a little tyke, Miller's major wearing desire was to be a racer, however he kept on playing cricket and Australian football. At 12 years old, he played for an under-15 Victorian students cricket group that visited Queensland under the captaincy of future Test batsman Merv Harvey. At the time, Miller stood just and used a sawn-off bat. His shots did not go far, however he awed onlookers with the way in which he moved his feet and stroked the ball. Mill operator's little stature in a physical game, for example, football constrained him to depend on physical valor, something for which he wound up celebrated. In any case, his absence of tallness provoked him to swing to horseracing. Mill operator saw his first Melbourne Cup in 1926 at seven years old and had been captivated from that point onward. Caulfield Racecourse was just a short separation from the family home, and Miller spent numerous early mornings viewing the coaches and maneuvers experience their schedules. He in the end induced his dad to give him a chance to take horseriding exercises. Beside being pulled in to the dashing society, Miller felt that as he seemed bound to be a little individual, he was bound to have an effective profession as a racer than in cricket or football.
