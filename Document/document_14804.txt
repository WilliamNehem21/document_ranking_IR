In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac met at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, with enlisted engineers Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Creation obligations were shared by the three gatherings, while the more actually skilled Caillat was in charge of the vast majority of the designing; he withdrew from nonappearance from Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles on the reason that Fleetwood Mac would inevitably utilize their offices. The set-up in Sausalito incorporated various little chronicle rooms in an expansive, austere wooden structure. Most band individuals griped about the studio and needed to record at their homes, however Fleetwood did not permit any moves. Christine McVie and Nicks chose to live in two apartment suites close to the city's harbor, while the male unforeseen remained at the studio's cabin in the adjoining slopes. Recording happened in a six-by-nine-meter room which incorporated a 3M 24-track tape machine, a scope of astounding receivers, and an API blending console with 550A equalizers; the last were utilized to control recurrence contrasts or a track's timbre. Despite the fact that Caillat was inspired with the set-up, he felt that the room needed mood as a result of its "extremely dead speakers" and a lot of soundproofing.
