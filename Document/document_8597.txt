In the 1996 version (volume 2) of "Lemur News", Alison Jolly adulated the main release for its "commitment to learning all in all" and "its impact on its target group." Like Gould, Jolly applauded the work as a field direct, just as Nash's fantastic delineations. She noticed the fascination of Nash's subfossil lemur remaking, guaranteeing that it was "quickly getting to be a standout amongst the most pilfered single book delineation on the primate address slide circuit." Jolly proceeded to laud the painstaking quality of the common history data accommodated every specie, including as of late portrayed species, taking note of that the data secured existing learning superior to anything some other distributed writing, notwithstanding when just a solitary passage was accommodated ineffectively known species. The book was prescribed for lemur masters, yet in addition for voyagers, trusting it would start an enthusiasm for ecotourism in devastated Madagascar. The agenda of species, just as the data on where to most effectively spot them, earned an extraordinary notice from Jolly, who could just flaunt seeing 30 the 50 known species around then. At long last, the "most critical and most thankful" group of onlookers Jolly referenced was the Malagasy analysts, to whom Mittermeier apparently gave 50 duplicates of the book amid a workshop in 1995.
