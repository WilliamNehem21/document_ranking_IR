In other current visual expressions, Cleopatra has been portrayed in mediums, for example, artistic creations and models. In her 1876 figure "The Death of Cleopatra", African American craftsman Edmonia Lewis, in spite of advocating the non-white female structure in works of art, portrayed Cleopatra with Caucasian highlights, maybe with regards to Cleopatra's recorded heredity as a Macedonian Greek. Lewis' Neoclassical model offers an after death perspective on Cleopatra wearing Egyptian formal attire and sitting on her position of royalty, which is enlivened with two sphinx heads that speak to the twins she held on for Mark Antony: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. A 1880 , now found in Lille, France, was once thought to be a work by Albert Darcq, however reclamation and cleaning of the model uncovered the mark of Charles Gauthier, to whom the work is currently credited. The 1874 painting "Passing of Cleopatra" by Jean-AndrÃÂ© Rixens delineates a dead Cleopatra with light skin, joined by maidservants with rather dull skin, a mix much of the time found in present day works of art depicting the scene of Cleopatra's demise. Orientalist works of art by Rixens and others impacted the half breed Ancient-Egyptian and Middle-Eastern style found in the J. Gordon Edwards' film "Cleopatra" featuring Bara, seen remaining on a Persian floor covering however with Egyptian divider compositions out of sight.
