The scope of "Oryzomys" stretches out from New Jersey in the eastern United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and CuraÃÂ§ao. Types of "Oryzomys" generally live in wet natural surroundings, for example, bogs, streams, and mangroves, however both the bog rice rodent and "O.ÃÂ couesi" are likewise incidentally experienced in drier living spaces. They happen or happened on numerous mainland rack islands and one maritime island, Jamaica; their ability at colonizing islands might be brought about by their nearby relationship with water and incessant event in beach front wetlands. The most seasoned fossils date to the Rancholabrean of the United States, around 300,000 years prior; in spite of the fact that there have been some before North American records, those are not in reality referable to "Oryzomys" or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely advanced in South America east of the Andes; the nearness of "Oryzomys" in Central America and different trans-Andean areas is believed to be the aftereffect of one of a few autonomous attacks of this district by oryzomyines. Then again, "Oryzomys" may have developed from the Pliocene North American "Jacobsomys". "O.ÃÂ antillarum" may have achieved Jamaica amid the last cold time frame while ocean levels were low.
