Harold Pinter earned a notoriety for being famously aggressive, perplexing, distant, laconic, thorny, touchy and denying. Pinter's unpolished political articulations, and the honor of the Nobel Prize in Literature, inspired solid analysis and even, now and again, incited scorn and individual assaults. The student of history Geoffrey Alderman, writer of the official history of Hackney Downs School, communicated his own "Jewish View" of Harold Pinter: "Whatever his legitimacy as an essayist, performing artist and chief, on a moral plane Harold Pinter appears to me to have been strongly defective, and his ethical compass profoundly broke." David Edgar, writing in "The Guardian", shielded Pinter against what he named Pinter's "being censured by the belligerati" like Johann Hari, who felt that he didn't "merit" to win the Nobel Prize. Later Pinter kept on battling against the Iraq War and for the benefit of other political causes that he bolstered. As Alderman calls attention to, for instance, Pinter marked the statement of purpose of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page ad, "What's going on with Israel? A Call by Jews in Britain", distributed in "The Times" on 6 July 2006, and he was a benefactor of the Palestine Festival of Literature.
