In the early 20th century, the taxonomy of extinct elephants became increasingly complicated. In 1942, Henry Fairfield Osborn's posthumous monograph on the Proboscidea was published, wherein he used various genus and subgenus names that had previously been proposed for extinct elephant species, such as "Archidiskodon", "Metarchidiskodon", "Parelephas", and "Mammonteus". Osborn also retained names for many regional and intermediate subspecies or "varieties", and created recombinations such as "Parelephas columbi felicis" and "Archidiskodon imperator maibeni". The taxonomic situation was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards: all species of mammoth were retained in the genus "Mammuthus", and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as intraspecific variation. In 2003, paleontologist Larry Agenbroad reviewed opinions about North American mammoth taxonomy, and concluded that several species had been declared junior synonyms, and that "M. columbi" (the Columbian mammoth) and "M. exilis" (the pygmy mammoth) were the only species of mammoth endemic to the Americas (as other species lived both there and in Eurasia). The idea that species such as "M. imperator" (the imperial mammoth) and "M. jeffersoni" (Jefferson's mammoth) were either more primitive or advanced stages in Columbian mammoth evolution was largely dismissed, and they were regarded as synonyms. In spite of these conclusions, Agenbroad cautioned that American mammoth taxonomy is not yet fully resolved.
