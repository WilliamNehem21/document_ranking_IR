"S. validum" is known from the Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian proportionate to the Judith River Group in the US), and examples have been recuperated from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (counting the lectotype example), and the Oldman Formation (center Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs "Hanssuesia" and "Foraminacephale" are likewise known from the two arrangements. "S. novomexicanum" is known from the Fruitland (late Campanian, around 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, around 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species effectively has a place in "Stegoceras", the sort would have had an expansive geographic circulation. The nearness of comparative pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America amid the most recent Cretaceous demonstrates that they were a vital piece of the dinosaur faunas there. It has generally been recommended that pachycehalosaurs occupied mountain situations; wear of their skulls was apparently a consequence of them having been moved by water from upland territories, and examinations with bighorn sheep strengthened the hypothesis. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans debated this thought, as the wear and unique areas of the skulls isn't predictable with having been transported in such a way, and they rather recommended that North American pachycephalosaurs occupied alluvial (related with water) and beach front plain situations.
