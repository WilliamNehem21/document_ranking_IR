When "Bellerophon" was propelled, there was no squeezing requirement for new warships. The marking of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 finished the American War of Independence while "Bellerophon" was still under development. Despite the fact that Greaves had been contracted to have her prepared for propelling by April 1784, she went through an additional two years on the slipway, most likely in light of the fact that the Navy Board requested development work to be postponed to enable her timber to be prepared, an extravagance accessible now that there were no squeezing military needs. At the point when the dispatch came, it was postponed a few times, at long last occurring amid a time of substantial pre-winter storms in October 1786. She was propelled with little function on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of Chatham Dockyard. She was then towed over the River Medway and moored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the dry dock there on 7 March 1787, where her frame was fitted with copper sheathing, and she was fitted for the Ordinary. Her last expenses came to ÃÂ£30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for structure her, and a further ÃÂ£8,376.15.2d spent on accommodating her for administration.
