The house of prayer experienced times of extension and redesign following the flames of 1270 and 1390 that incorporated the multiplying long of the choir, the arrangement of external walkways toward the northern and southern dividers of both the nave and choir. Today, these dividers are at full stature in spots and at establishment level in others yet the generally speaking cruciform shape is as yet noticeable. A for the most part flawless octagonal section house dates from the real broadening after the flame of 1270. The peak divider over the twofold entryway entrance that connects the west towers is about finished and was revamped following the flame of 1390. It obliges a vast window opening that now just contains stub tracery work and pieces of an expansive rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in the two transepts and in the south walkway of the choir contain representations of priests and knights, and huge level sections in the now grass-secured floor of the house of God mark the places of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and groups, or manors, remained in the chanonry and were annihilated by flame on three events: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are generally finished and were a piece of the main period of development. Just the precentor's manor is significantly unblemished; two others have been joined into private structures. A defensive mass of huge extents encompassed the church building region, yet just a little area has endure. The divider had four access doors, one of whichÃ¢ÂÂthe Pans PortÃ¢ÂÂstill exists.
