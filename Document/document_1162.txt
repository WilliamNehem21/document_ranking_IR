With the clearing to a great extent total, the British government directed its concentration toward the four British United Nations Military Observers (UNMOs) being held by the RUF. English powers in Freetown encouraged the getaway of four UNMOs (three British and one from New Zealand) from an UNAMSIL camp at Makeni, which had been attacked by the RUF since ten RUF contenders had been acknowledged into the demilitarization procedure. Subsequent to counseling with the British order in Freetown, the four officers left the camp and secretively passed the RUF line before trekking west. They touched base at the UN base at Mile 91 right around 24 hours after the fact, and a RAF Chinook lifted them up and flew them to Freetown. Never again having the unarmed eyewitnesses to secure, the Kenyan UNAMSIL separation at Makeni battled out of the attack and continued west to join other UNAMSIL powers. With the three British officers from Makeni liberated, just a single British UNMOÃ¢ÂÂMajor Andy HarrisonÃ¢ÂÂremained a detainee of the RUF, and the British government started attentively endeavoring to set up his area. Harrison and ten different UNMOs had at first been held by the RUF at the last's base until Harrison persuaded the RUF to enable the spectators to join the Indian UNAMSIL unexpected at Kailahun.
