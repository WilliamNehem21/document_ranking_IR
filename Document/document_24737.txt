Balzac's vision of a society in which class, money and personal ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: "I have learned more [from Balzac] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said 1984: "Iâm sure that my life in France would have been very different had I not met Balzac. [He taught me] the way that country and its society works." In 1970 Roland Barthes published "S/Z", a detailed analysis of Balzac's story "Sarrasine" and a key work in structuralist literary criticism.
Balzac has also influenced popular culture. Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials, including: Travers Vale's "PÃ¨re Goriot" (1915), "Les Chouans" (1947), "Le PÃ¨re Goriot" (1968 BBC mini-series), and "La Cousine Bette" (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in Meredith Willson's musical "The Music Man". He is included in FranÃ§ois Truffaut's 1959 film, "The 400 Blows". Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers.
