I-805 continues northward through San Diego, where it intersects SRÂ 94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SRÂ 15, the continuation of I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.
After intersecting SRÂ 163, also known as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SRÂ 52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SRÂ 52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21Â lanes wide. Eastbound SRÂ 56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SRÂ 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.
