Since the distribution of Cullen's and Farson's books, other Ripper writers have contended that their hypotheses depend entirely on defective incidental proof, and have endeavored to give Druitt explanations for the seasons of the homicides. On 1 September, the day after the homicide of Nichols, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket. Upon the arrival of Chapman's homicide, he played cricket in Blackheath, and the day after the killings of Stride and Eddowes, he was in the West Country safeguarding a customer in a court case. While authors Andrew Spallek and Tom Cullen contend that Druitt had sufficient energy and chance to go via train among London and his cricket and legitimate commitment, or utilize his city chambers as a base from which to submit the killings, others reject that as "unrealistic". Numerous specialists trust that the executioner was nearby to Whitechapel, though Druitt lived miles away on the opposite side of the River Thames. His chambers were inside strolling separation of Whitechapel, and his customary rail voyage would more likely than not have conveyed him to Cannon Street station, a couple of minutes' stroll from the East End. It appears to be impossible, notwithstanding, that he could have ventured to every part of the separation in blood-recolored garments unnoticed, and a hint found amid the examination concerning the homicide of Catherine Eddowes (a bit of her blood-recolored garments) demonstrates that the killer voyaged north-east from where she was killed, while Druitt's chambers, and the railroad station, were toward the south-west.
