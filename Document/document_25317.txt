During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous. He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use. The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, "In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a "pp" tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another."
For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: "Rapsodie espagnole", "La valse" and the two concertos. All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in "Daphnis et ChloÃ©", or as a reworking of piano pieces, "Alborada del gracioso" and "Une barque sur l'ocean", ("Miroirs"), "Valses nobles et sentimentales," " Ma mÃ¨re l'Oye", "Tzigane" (originally for violin and piano) and "Le tombeau de Couperin." In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms. Occasionally, as in the "Alborada del gracioso", critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.
