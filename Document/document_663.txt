By 23 August, Kawaguchi's unit had come to Truk and was stacked onto moderate transport ships for the remainder of the excursion to Guadalcanal. On account of the harm brought about by Allied air assault to a different troop caravan amid the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Japanese chose not to convey Kawaguchi's troops to Guadalcanal by moderate transport dispatch; rather, the boats conveying Kawaguchi's officers were sent to Rabaul. From that point, the Japanese wanted to convey Kawaguchi's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers, arranging through a Japanese maritime base in the Shortland Islands. The Japanese destroyers were generally ready to make the round outing down "The Slot" to Guadalcanal and in a solitary night, limiting their presentation to Allied air assault. Be that as it may, the greater part of the fighters' substantial gear and supplies, for example, overwhelming ordnance, vehicles, and much sustenance and ammo, couldn't be taken to Guadalcanal with them. These fast destroyer rushes to Guadalcanal, which happened all through the crusade, were later called the "Tokyo Express" by Allied powers and "Rodent Transportation" by the Japanese. The Japanese controlled the oceans around the Solomon Islands amid the evening time and were not tested by the Allies. Be that as it may, any Japanese ship staying inside the scope of the flying machine at Henderson Field in sunshine was in incredible threat from air assaults. This "inquisitive strategic circumstance" held for a while.
