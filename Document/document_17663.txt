The building phase started on September 22, 1966, on the interchange that was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86Â million (about $ in dollars). SRÂ 109 was planned to follow Camino del Rio up to the Frontier traffic circle, where the city of San Diego would resume construction; both SRÂ 109 and SRÂ 209 were to be built in the future. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Bidding for the SRÂ 109 contract was to begin in 1968, after the City Council endorsed the route in December 1967. Completion of both the interchange and SRÂ 109 was planned for early 1969. An interchange was planned at Midway Drive, and the western end of the freeway was to be at Sunset Cliffs and Nimitz boulevards. The cost of the SRÂ 109 project was estimated to be $2.3Â million (about $ in dollars).
The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, and a second ramp from southbound I-5 to eastbound I-8 opened in August 1968, with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969. The groundbreaking for the Ocean Beach Freeway took place on September 23, 1968, with the estimated completion to take place within 15 months. However, rain in February 1969 delayed many construction projects across the county, including the SRÂ 109 extension. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October. The routing of SRÂ 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972.
