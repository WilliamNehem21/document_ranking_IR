Pope Gregory VII sanctified ÃÂlfheah in 1078, with a gala day of 19 April. Lanfranc, the main post-Conquest ecclesiastical overseer, was questionable about a portion of the holy people loved at Canterbury. He was convinced of ÃÂlfheah's holiness, yet ÃÂlfheah and Augustine of Canterbury were the main pre-success Anglo-Saxon diocese supervisors kept on Canterbury's date-book of holy people. ÃÂlfheah's sanctuary, which had turned out to be ignored, was revamped and extended in the mid twelfth century under Anselm of Canterbury, who was instrumental in holding ÃÂlfheah's name in the congregation logbook. After the 1174 flame in Canterbury Cathedral, ÃÂlfheah's remaining parts together with those of Dunstan were put around the high raised area, at which Thomas Becket is said to have complimented his life into ÃÂlfheah's consideration in no time before his affliction amid the Becket debate. The new hallowed place was fixed in lead, and was north of the high raised area, imparting the respect to Dunstan's sanctum, which was found south of the high special stepped area. An "Actual existence of Saint ÃÂlfheah" in exposition and refrain was composed by a Canterbury priest named Osbern, at Lanfranc's solicitation. The exposition rendition has endure, however the "Life" is especially a hagiography: a considerable lot of the tales it contains have evident Biblical parallels, making them think as a chronicled record.
