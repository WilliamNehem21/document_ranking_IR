Another notable Jain writer in Kannada was Sri Ponna, patronised by King Krishna III and famed for "Shantipurana", his account of the life of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain tirthankara. He earned the title "Ubhaya Kavichakravathi" (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were "Bhuvanaika-ramaabhyudaya", "Jinaksharamale" and "Gatapratyagata". Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called "gems of Kannada literature".
Prose works in Sanskrit was prolific during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, a native of Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was "Ganitasarasangraha", a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of "Yasastilaka champu", "Nitivakyamrita" and other writings. The main aim of the "champu" writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of "Arthashastra" from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called "Kalyanakaraka". He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.
