Ranavalona III was broadcasted ruler upon the demise of her forerunner, Queen Ranavalona II, on July 13, 1883, and moved into Tsarahafatra, a wooden house on the grounds of the regal Rova complex in Antananarivo. Her crowning celebration occurred in the Mahamasina neighborhood of Antananarivo on November 22, 1883, her 22nd birthday, where she was given the title "Her Majesty Ranavalona III by the finesse of God and the desire of the general population, Queen of Madagascar, and Protectoress of the laws of the Nation". She broke with convention by enhancing the standard entourage of warriors at her function with a gathering of 500 male and 400 female students from the capital's best schools. The young ladies were wearing white while the young men wore officers' outfits and performed conventional military drills with lances. Ranavalona was delegated wearing a white silk outfit with a red train highlighting weaving and gold embellishments. The ruler was portrayed in the American press in the accompanying terms: "She is a little over the conventional tallness and has sensitive highlights, her composition is somewhat darker than that of the greater part of her subjects. She shows up very shy and she manages well at the serious elements of her court."
