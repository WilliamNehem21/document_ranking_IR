Spinosaurids seem to have been far reaching from the Barremian to the Cenomanian phases of the Cretaceous, around 130 to 95 million years back, while the most seasoned known spinosaurid remains date to the Middle Jurassic. They shared highlights, for example, long, thin, crocodile-like skulls; sub-roundabout teeth, with fine to no serrations; the terminal rosette of the nose; and an auxiliary sense of taste that made them progressively impervious to torsion. Interestingly, the crude and run of the mill condition for theropods was a tall, tight nose with sharp edge like (ziphodont) teeth with serrated carinae. The skull adjustments of spinosaurids met with those of crocodilians; early individuals from the last gathering had skulls like ordinary theropods, later creating extended noses, cone shaped teeth, and auxiliary palates. These adjustments may have been the aftereffect of a dietary change from earthly prey to angle. In contrast to crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of baryonychine spinosaurids don't seem to have amphibian adjustments. Sereno and associates proposed in 1998 that the huge thumb-hook and hearty forelimbs of spinosaurids advanced in the Middle Jurassic, before the lengthening of the skull and different adjustments identified with fish-eating, since the previous highlights are imparted to their megalosaurid relatives. They additionally recommended that the spinosaurines and baryonychines wandered before the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous.
