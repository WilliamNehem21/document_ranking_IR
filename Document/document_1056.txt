Tyler made the extension of the Republic of Texas part of his motivation not long after in the wake of getting to be president. Texas had announced autonomy from Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1836, despite the fact that Mexico still wouldn't recognize its power. The general population of Texas effectively sought after joining the Union, however Jackson and Van Buren had been hesitant to arouse strains over subjugation by attaching another Southern state. Despite the fact that Tyler planned addition to be the point of convergence of his organization, Secretary Webster was contradicted, and persuaded Tyler to focus on Pacific activities until some other time in his term. Tyler's craving for western expansionism is recognized by history specialists and researchers, however sees vary with respect to the inspirations driving it. Biographer Edward C. Crapol takes note of that amid the administration of James Monroe, Tyler (at that point in the House of Representatives) had proposed servitude was a "foreboding shadow" drifting over the Union, and that it would be "well to scatter this cloud" so that with less blacks in the more established slave expresses, a procedure of progressive liberation would start in Virginia and other upper Southern states. History specialist William W. Freehling, notwithstanding, composed that Tyler's legitimate inspiration in attaching Texas was to defeat presumed endeavors by Great Britain to advance a liberation of slaves in Texas that would debilitate the foundation in the United States.
