In July 1861, Congress approved the administration to issue Demand Notes, the principal type of paper cash issued straightforwardly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie ("i.e.", gold or silver coin) be that as it may, as Sherman would note in his journals, they didn't tackle the income issue, as the administration did not have the coin to reclaim the notes should they all be introduced for installment. To tackle this issue, Chase requested and Congress approved the issuance of $150 million in bonds, which (as banks acquired them with gold) renewed the treasury. Congress likewise tried to expand income when they passed the Revenue Act of 1861, which forced the primary government salary charge in American history. Sherman embraced the measure, and even talked for a more extreme assessment than the one forced by the Act (3% on pay above $800), wanting to raise income by tax assessment than by obtaining. In August, the unique session shut and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to advance military enlistment once more.
