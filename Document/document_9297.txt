Dacko didn't know about the occasions occurring in the capital. In the wake of leaving his clergyman's ranch close midnight, he made a beeline for Simon Samba's home to ask the Aka Pgymy pioneer to lead a year-end custom. Following an hour at Samba's home, he was educated of the upset in Bangui. He was captured by a couple of Bokassa's men as he entered PÃÂ©tÃÂ©vo Junction, on the western outskirt of the capital. Dacko was escorted to the presidential royal residence, where Bokassa embraced the president and let him know, "I attempted to caution youÃ¢ÂÂhowever at this point it's past the point of no return". President Dacko was then taken to Ngaragba Prison in east Bangui at around 02:00ÃÂ WAT. In a move that he thought would support his prominence in the nation, Bokassa requested jail executive Otto Sacher to discharge all detainees in the correctional facility. Bokassa then took Dacko to Camp KassaÃÂ¯ at 03:20ÃÂ WAT, where the president was constrained by Banza to leave from office. Banza needed to execute Dacko, yet Bokassa would not permit it, trusting that Dacko had not yet outlasted his value. Afterward, Bokassa's officers reported on Radio-Bangui that the Dacko government had been toppled and Bokassa had assumed control over control. Then, Banza took over regulatory focuses, where legislators, negotiators and other abnormal state authorities were commending the happening to the New Year.
