Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete. It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a -deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to 16 spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from in mass, and the size of a billiard ball. Some observations suggest that the average clutch size for domed populations (9.6Â per clutch for "C. porteri" on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6Â per clutch for "C. duncanensis" on PinzÃ³n). The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay one to four clutches per season. Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings, with lower-temperature nests producing more males and higher-temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).
