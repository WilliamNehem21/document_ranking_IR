Sherman's open appraisal of California Chrome's poor exhibitions was that he was all the while developing and figuring out how to be a racehorse. Be that as it may, a few things started to change. In the fall of 2013, Alberto's more youthful sibling, Willie Delgado, an accomplished rider and coach whose vocation in Maryland was in the doldrums, moved to California and inside two or three months turned into the pony's morning exercise rider. At generally a similar time, Alberto was removed the steed as racer. In December, California Chrome started wearing another sort of horseshoe. He had grown low heels, and his farrier, Judd Fisher, found a specific style of stuck on horseshoe with a tough, hard, edge cushion that raised a steed's heels was appropriate for fixing the issue. Rather than sticking it on, Fisher specially bored openings into the shoe so it could be nailed to the steed's feet in the way of a conventional metal shoe. As indicated by Fisher, nailing on the shoes raised the bottoms of the steed's feet somewhat more distant off the ground. It might have been a contributing variable to California Chrome's ensuing arrangement of wins. Beside that issue, Sherman depicted the steed's hooves as for the most part solid.
