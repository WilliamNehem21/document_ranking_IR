Hutton was picked to go on the MCC voyage through Australia in 1950Ã¢ÂÂ 51, under the captaincy of the beginner Freddie Brown. The last was a surprising decision as skipper, after a battle to locate an appropriate novice for the job. As a trade off went for commentators who supported the arrangement of an expert commander, the expert Denis Compton was made bad habit skipper, however Brown came to depend more on Hutton than on Compton for exhortation. The visit selectors, trying to fortify the batting line-up, requested that Hutton bat in the center request as opposed to his standard position as opener. He batted well in the early recreations however the group battled. In the principal Test, England expelled Australia for 228 preceding precipitation made the pitch troublesome for batting. In answer, England crumbled to 68 for seven preceding Brown pronounced to make Australia bat again while the pitch was as yet slippery. Australia thus attempted to 32 for seven, preceding proclaiming to leave England requiring 193 to win. Before the finish of the third day's play, triumph appeared to be far-fetched as England were 30 for six. Next morning on a marginally simpler pitch, Hutton scored 62 not out, an innings which was generally acclaimed in the press. "Wisden" saw that he had "given one more show of his great batsmanship on precarious turf ... Hutton whipped the quick bowlers gloriously and played the turning or lifting ball no sweat of an ace skilled worker." However, the group were bowled out for 122 and Australia won by 70 runs.
