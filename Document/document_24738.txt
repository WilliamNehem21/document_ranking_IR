The Wii Family Edition is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally (the vertical feet are still present; however, the front labels are rotated and a stand is no longer included) and removes the GameCube controller and memory card ports, although the casing under the top cover still has the GameCube controller and memory card ports holes with no ports and no slots. For this reason, the Family Edition variant is incompatible with GameCube games and accessories. The console was announced on August 17, 2011 and was released in the United States on October 23, 2011 and Europe on November 4, 2011.
The Wii Family Edition was made available in Europe, bundled with a Wii Remote Plus, "Wii Party" and "Wii Sports". The console launched in white, but later a black Wii Family Edition bundled with "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" and the official soundtrack CD of "Super Mario Galaxy" was released on October 23, 2011 and a blue Wii Family Edition was released to coincide with Black Friday and the release of "Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games" on November 18, 2011. In late 2012, Nintendo released a version of the North America black edition, including "Wii Sports" and "Wii Sports Resort" games on a single disc instead of the "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" game and the "Super Mario Galaxy" soundtrack.
