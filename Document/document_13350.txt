Armstrong's initial two books, "An English Phonetic Reader" (1923) and "A Burmese Phonetic Reader" (1925, with Pe Maung Tin), were a piece of the London Phonetics Readers Series, altered by Daniel Jones. Books in this arrangement gave a phonetic sketch just as writings deciphered in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Her "English Phonetic Reader" included translations of entries composed by Alfred George Gardiner, Henry James, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas Hardy, and John Ruskin. Jones had urged Armstrong to compose a phonetic peruser of English in "thin interpretation". One of the main refinements of "limited interpretation" for English was the utilization of the extra phonetic images for vowels, for example, (as in the RP elocution of ), (), and (). In the examination behind a Jonesian "expansive translation" of English, the vital contrast between those vowels and the vowels (), and (), individually, was thought of as length rather than quality; in like manner, the nonattendance or nearness of a length diacritic was utilized to recognize these vowels rather than discrete IPA characters. Armstrong's restricted interpretation for the peruser utilized these additional vowel images and expressly checked vowel length with the diacritics 'half-long' and 'long'. She additionally talked about the utilization of tight interpretation in her first paper for "Le MaÃÂ®tre Phonetique", distributed as one of its ("", "Highlight articles"); Armstrong entreated the diary's perusers to figure out how to utilize the additional images. Armstrong's "An English Phonetic Reader", Armstrong and Ward's "Handbook of English Intonation", and Ward's "The Phonetics of English" were the first to promote this interpretation framework for English.
