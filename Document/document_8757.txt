Having recently removed the motor cowling, he spotted adversary tanks drawing nearer and quickly took off with the motor presented to the components, securely arriving back at base. He was shot down for the second time on 30ÃÂ May, when he connected with eight BfÃÂ 109s and wrecked one preceding being hit and compelled to crash land at fast in a dead zone. He descended in a minefield amid a furious tank fight, and was compelled to remain where he was as troops of the two sides gradually met on him; British powers figured out how to contact him first and, after treatment for wounds, he again came back to his squadron. On 26ÃÂ June, notwithstanding, subsequent to being assaulted by two BfÃÂ 109s and ransoming of his consuming Kittyhawk, he was caught by Italian warriors and taken as a wartime captive, first to Tobruk, and afterward to Italy, where he got emergency clinic treatment for genuine injuries. He later discovered that the pilot who shot him down was Oberleutnant Werner Schroer, a Luftwaffe expert credited with sixty-one triumphs in North Africa. Bobby Gibbes, having recouped from his own wounds, again took direction of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron. Amid his imprisonment, on 5ÃÂ February 1943, Barr was granted a Bar to his DFC for "pulverizing further adversary flying machine".
