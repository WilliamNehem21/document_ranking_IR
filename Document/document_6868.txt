The melodic score of "Conclusive Fantasy VII" was formed, organized, and delivered by Nobuo Uematsu, who had filled in as the sole author for the six past "Definite Fantasy" diversions. Initially, Uematsu had intended to utilize CD quality music with vocal exhibitions to exploit the support's sound abilities yet discovered that it brought about the amusement having any longer stacking occasions for every territory. Uematsu then chosen that the higher quality sound was not worth the exchange off with execution, and picked rather to utilize MIDI-like sounds created by the comfort's inward solid sequencer, like how his soundtracks for the past recreations in the arrangement on the Super NES were actualized. While the Super NES just had eight sound channels to work with, the PlayStation had twenty-four. Eight were saved for audio cues, leaving sixteen accessible for the music. Uematsu's way to deal with creating the amusement's music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and make music that mirrored the state of mind of the scenes, instead of attempting to make solid tunes to "characterize the diversion", as he felt that approach would go over too solid when set nearby the amusement's new 3D visuals. For instance, he formed the track expected for the scene in the diversion where Aerith Gainsborough is slaughtered to be "tragic however delightful", as opposed to all the more plainly passionate, making what he felt was an increasingly downplayed inclination. Uematsu furthermore said that the soundtrack had a vibe of "authenticity", which likewise kept him from utilizing "extravagant, insane music".
