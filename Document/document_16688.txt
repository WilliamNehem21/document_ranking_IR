Until the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller cannons; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasised boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with "Vasa", he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns. Five such ships were built after "Vasa" ("Ãpplet", "Kronan", "Scepter" and "GÃ¶ta Ark") before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king's death in 1632. These ships, especially "Kronan" and "Scepter", were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called "regalskepp" (usually translated as 'royal ships'), "Ãpplet" ('The Apple'; the Swedish term for the globus cruciger), was built simultaneously with "Vasa". The only significant difference between the design of "Vasa" and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a metre (3.1Â ft).
