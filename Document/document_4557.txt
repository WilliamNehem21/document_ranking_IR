"Kahaani" earned commonly positive surveys from commentators. As indicated by audit aggregator "Survey Gang" the film got a rating of 7.5 out of 10, in view of the surveys by expert faultfinders. Great verbal exposure had an influence in its prevalence other than the positive audits. "The Telegraph" called the film "a mind-juggling mixture of control taking on the appearance of a 'mother of a story'". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and applauded Vidya's acting. "The Times of India" remarked "By and by, a 'pregnant' Vidya, unexpectedly shows increasingly 'male ornaments'ÃÂ ... than generally saints." The surveys in Rediff, Indo Asian News Service, CNN-IBN, Zee News, "Hindustan Times", and "The Hindu" were consistently positive, and noted content, heading, cinematography, and going about as solid purposes of the film. Noted film on-screen character and various National Award champ Shabana Azmi commended Vidya for her performance,"As an on-screen character, I could see she [Vidya] was making all the correct moves all through the film. There was not a solitary counterfeit note in her execution." Russell Edwards, the analyst for "Assortment", adulated the cast, cinematography, and bearing, and remarked that in spite of intermittent glitches, the "dexterous thrillerÃÂ ... keeps up energy and believability."
