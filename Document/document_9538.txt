The ship came back to Japan for fixes in mid-November. Absence of fuel and materials implied that she couldn't be brought once more into administration and she was transformed into a drifting enemy of flying machine battery. Her pipe and mainmast were evacuated to improve the bends of shoot of her AA firearms, which were expanded by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple 25ÃÂ mm weapon mounts. Her forward optional firearms were evacuated in pay. A coal-consuming jackass evaporator was introduced on the dock for warming and cooking purposes and a changed over submarine chaser was moored close by to give steam and power; her enemy of air ship weapons needed full power and were just incompletely operational. On 20 April "Nagato" was diminished to save. In June 1945, every last bit of her optional firearms and about portion of her enemy of air ship combat hardware was moved aground, together with her rangefinders and searchlights. Her group was in this manner decreased to under 1,000 officers and enrolled men. On 18 July 1945, the intensely disguised ship was assaulted via transporter based warrior aircraft and torpedo planes. "Nagato" was hit by two bombs and a rocket that executed 35 men and harmed four 25ÃÂ mm firearms. On 30 August, a couple of days before the formal surrender, American mariners assumed responsibility for the ship.
