Animation Network requested that Ward present an example content for their thought, yet Frederator persuaded him to harsh out a storyboard rather, as "a board would give a superior feeling of what was at the forefront of Pen's thoughts", as indicated by Frederator's VP Eric Homan. Ward and his school companions Patrick McHale and Adam Muto (the previous of whom filled in as an essayist, storyboard craftsman, and inventive chief for the show amid its initial couple of seasons, while the last filled in as a storyboard craftsman and imaginative executive for the show before in the long run turning into its showrunner) started creating thoughts, at the same time focusing on "keep[ing] the beneficial things about the first short [while also] improv[ing] on" them. The gathering's first item was a harsh storyboard that included Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-dinner date. Animation Network was not content with this story, thus Ward, McHale, and Muto made a storyboard for the scene "The Enchiridion!", which was their endeavor to deliberately copy the style of the first Nicktoons short. This strategy demonstrated effective, and Cartoon Network affirmed the primary season in September 2008. "The Enchiridion!" was the main scene to go into generation.
