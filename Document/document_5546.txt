The insides were recorded in two uniquely changed over flying machine sheds close Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were rented for ÃÂ£1,500; this cost-measure brought about a significant part of the exchange being re-recorded later, on the grounds that the tin tops of the storages caused a reverberation. The outside shots run from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the angler) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes catch). The following shot of the snare after the opening credits was recorded at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, an area oftentimes utilized by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-consuming scene, was the genuine Lavenham Market Square; the group brought down TV radio wires and phone wires and Waddilove contracted a careful selector from a nearby service organization for ÃÂ£10, in light of the fact that the unit couldn't manage the cost of a camera crane. The wide open vistas found in the pursuit scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area close Thetford, NorfolkÃ¢ÂÂthe maker, through associations with the administration, had the capacity to rent portions of the territory. The congregation utilized in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The channel suffocating and hanging scenes were recorded at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The peak of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the bank of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Taping wrapped as booked on 13 November 1967.
