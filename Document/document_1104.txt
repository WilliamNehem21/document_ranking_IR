The understudies went to a generation and practice meeting for the scene. The legislature of California gave Jefferson High School a concede to help a program to enable the understudies to be a piece of the recording and after generation of the scene. Film creation organization Screen Gems joined Montgomery and Asher in making gifts to the program also. The understudies gave the cash they got for composing the scene to an establishment to prop the program up. Two additional treks were sorted out, bringing an aggregate of fifty Jefferson High School understudies to the arrangement of "Entranced". Asher sent duplicates of thirty contents of other "Entranced" scenes to the school for use in study halls. Saunders found the program an extraordinary achievement, saying "kids who would never compose were presently composing three pages. Children who couldn't peruse were currently getting serious about contents and battling about who might almost certainly play the leads." Asher likewise communicated delight with the program's prosperity, and prescribed that other white businessmen welcome minority bunches into their lives. Sargent considered Saunders the primary purpose behind the achievement of the program, saying, "She was keen on creative types of instructing. These children, who may have been stuck in the ghetto for the remainder of their lives, cherished "Beguiled", and with only a little endorsement and inspiration, woke up on the set."
