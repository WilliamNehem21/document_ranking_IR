The taphonomy (changes among death and fossilization) of the "Irritator challengeri" holotype example has been examined by certain scientists. The skull was discovered lying on its side. Going before fossilization, a few bones from the back of the braincase, just as the dentary, splenial, coronoid, and right precise bones from the lower jaw were lost. Different bones, for the most part from the skull back, had progressed toward becoming and uprooted towards substitute locales of the head before internment. Naish and partners in 2004 attested that the Romualdo Formation dinosaur fauna is spoken to by creatures that kicked the bucket close shorelines or streams before being done to ocean, where their coasting remains were in the long run fossilized. In 2018, Aureliano and partners contended against this situation, expressing that the "Irritator challengeri" holotype's mandible was saved in enunciation with the remainder of the skull, while it would have likely separated had the corpse been drifting adrift. They likewise noticed that the carcass would have rapidly sunk because of the osteosclerosis of the skeleton. The analysts thusly presumed that fossils from the Santana Group speak to living beings that were covered in their characteristic territory, rather than having been saved allochthonously (other than at their present position).
