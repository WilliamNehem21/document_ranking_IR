Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus initially depicted the class "Elephas" and an elephant from Sri Lanka (at that point known as Ceylon) under the binomial "Elephas maximus" in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier characterized the Indian elephant under the binomial "Elephas indicus". Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck portrayed the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the binomial "Elephas sumatranus". English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen arranged every one of the three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants change geologically in their shading and measure of depigmentation. The Sri Lankan elephant ("Elephas maximus") possesses Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant ("E.ÃÂ m.ÃÂ indicus") is local to terrain Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant ("E.ÃÂ m.ÃÂ sumatranus") is found in Sumatra. One questioned subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is littler than the various subspecies. It has bigger ears, a more drawn out tail, and straighter tusks than the run of the mill elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala depicted it in 1950 under the trinomial "Elephas maximus borneensis", taking as his sort a representation in "National Geographic". It was in this way subsumed under either "E.ÃÂ m.ÃÂ indicus" or "E.ÃÂ m.ÃÂ sumatranus". Aftereffects of a 2003 hereditary examination show its predecessors isolated from the territory populace about 300,000ÃÂ years prior. A recent report found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but rather were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are presently wiped out.
