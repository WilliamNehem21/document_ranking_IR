H. L. Gold, "Cosmic system" first proofreader, had worked at Standard Magazines in the mid 1940s as an associate manager, perusing for Standard's three sci-fi pulps: "Surprising Stories", "Exciting Wonder", and "Chief Future". With the coming of the war, Gold left distributing and went into the military, however in late 1949 he was drawn closer by Vera Cerutti, who had once worked for him. Cerutti was currently working for a French-Italian distributer, ÃÂditions Mondiales Del Duca established by Cino Del Duca, that had opened an office in New York as World Editions. She at first approached Gold for direction on the best way to deliver a magazine, which he gave. World Editions assumed an overwhelming misfortune on "Interest", its first endeavor to dispatch a US magazine, and Cerutti came back to Gold requesting proposals for new titles. Gold thought about "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction", a review propelled in the fall of 1949, yet felt that there was still room in the market for another genuine sci-fi magazine. He sent an outline to World Editions that incorporated a proposition for a progression of soft cover sf books just as a periodical, and proposed paying three pennies a word, an amazingly high rate, given that most contending magazines were paying just a single penny a word. World Editions concurred, contracted Gold as the editorial manager, and the principal issue showed up in October 1950. The tale arrangement along these lines showed up as "System Science Fiction Novels".
