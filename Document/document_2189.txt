All through "The Ecstatic", Mos Def shifted back and forth between what AllMusic's Andy Kellman called unreasonable yet learned raps and "apparently apathetic, without any preparation gloats", set against unconventional, delicately reverbed creations. As per "The Guardian"s Paul MacInnes, "The Ecstatic" included his naturally "divided melodious style, which circled words inside expressions and played on sound as much as significance". "Hall" exhibited his "unpredictable and tangled" lyricism conveyed intently in musicality with the beat, Patrin stated, refering to the lines "soul is the lion's thunder, voice is the alarm/I swing 'round, wring out and cut down the dictator/cleave a little hatchet and thump a goliath disproportionate". He investigated Afrocentric subjects on "Disclosures" and contrasted love with a gunfight on "Pistola". On "Roses", Muldrow sang nature-accommodating verses about attracting blossoms times of misery as opposed to culling them starting from the earliest stage. "Roses is about innovativeness and human limit", she clarified. "A great deal of times Western culture comprehends worth on 'precious stones are perpetually' or 'twelve roses' and that is the way you demonstrate your affection to somebodyÃÂ ... in any case, you get such a significant number of blessings and still feel vacant. So draw them and let the roses originate from inside."
