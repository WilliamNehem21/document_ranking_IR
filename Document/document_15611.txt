Anna was married: Bede refers to the saint SÃ¦thryth as "daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East Angles". In Abbott Folcard's "Life of St Botolph", written in the 11th century, Botolph is described as having been at one time the chaplain to the sisters of a king, Ãthelmund, whose mother was named SÃ¦wara. Folcard names two of SÃ¦wara's kinsmen as Ãthelhere and Ãthelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna's brothers, Steven Plunkett suggests that it is "tempting" to consider that SÃ¦wara was married to Anna, and that Ãthelmund might either be Anna's full name, or the name of an otherwise unknown East Anglian sub-king. The "Liber Eliensis" names Hereswith, the sister of Hild, abbess of Whitby, as Anna's wife and the mother of SÃ¦thryth, Seaxburh of Ely and Ãthelthryth. However, the "Liber Eliensis" is regarded with caution by historians: Rosalind Love says that the mediaeval writers who interpreted Bede's information about Hereswith made an "erroneous assumption" regarding her connection with Anna and his family. Historians now believe that Hereswith was Anna's sister-in-law and that around the time that she married into the East Anglian royal family, Anna had already been king for a decade.
