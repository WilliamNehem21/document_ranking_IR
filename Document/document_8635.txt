On 24 October Newton, presently driving a Ford cantina, met Scott by plan in Combe Martin, only north of Barnstaple. Newton disclosed that he needed to drive to Porlock, around 25 miles away, and proposed that Scott go with himÃ¢ÂÂhe and Scott could chat on the voyage. Scott had with him his as of late gained pet puppy, a Great Dane called Rinka; this unsettled Newton, who feared hounds, yet Scott demanded that Rinka run with them. At Porlock, Newton left Scott and Rinka at an inn while he apparently managed his business. He lifted them up not long after 8ÃÂ pm, and they started the drive back to Combe Martin. On an abandoned stretch of street, Newton started to drive sporadically, faking tiredness, and acknowledged Scott's proposal that he assume control over the driving. They ceased; Scott got out, trailed by Rinka, and kept running round to the driver's side, where he discovered Newton, weapon close by. Newton shot the pooch in the head and, saying "It's your turn currently", pointed the firearm at Scott. The gun neglected to discharge a few times; in the long run Newton hopped into the vehicle and headed out, leaving Scott and the dead or biting the dust hound by the roadside.
