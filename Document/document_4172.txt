"Hex Enduction Hour" takes impact from the Velvet Underground's "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart and the mid 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith has said that the title was proposed to conjure black magic, that he prepared "Enduction" to recommend the collection could be an audience's acceptance into the Fall and that "Hex" was a reference to this being the band's 6th discharge. His vocals are higher in the blend than on past Fall discharges and were depicted in 1982 by "Sounds" as "emerg[ing] like a loudhailer from a mist of guitar scratch". The tunes were intentionally created in a crude and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound portrayed at the time as a "very much delivered commotion" that was worthy by Fall norms. Faultfinder Mark Storace guaranteed that he "could have completed a superior occupation on a 4-track on the off chance that I was pissed out of my head". Smith reacted by saying that "these days individuals just can't simply quiets down in the event that they don't have the foggiest idea what they're looking at." Elaborating on the intentionally crude generation esteems, Smith commented that "it was altogether recorded in purposely terrible places...deliberately straightforward kind of thing. Three tunes were composed at practice and done whenever."
