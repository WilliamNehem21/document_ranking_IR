As the Japanese advanced in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three fighter unitsâNos.Â 75, 76 and 77 Squadronsâequipped with Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks recently delivered from the United States. No.Â 77 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, on 16Â March, with a complement of three officers and 100 men. Temporarily commanded by Squadron Leader D. F. Forsyth, the unit was initially responsible for the defence of Perth. Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell assumed command on 20Â April. The squadron transferred to Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory, in August, the first RAAF fighter unit to be stationed in the area. Until this time, air defence over Darwin had been provided by the P-40s flown by the USAAF's 49th Fighter Group. No.Â 77 Squadron moved to another of Darwin's satellite airfields, Livingstone, in September. Among its pilots was John Gorton, future Prime Minister of Australia. No.Â 77 Squadron saw action defending Darwin from Japanese air raids and claimed its first aerial victory just after 5Â a.m. on 23Â November 1942, when Cresswell destroyed a Mitsubishi "Betty" bomber. It was the first "kill" for an Australian squadron over the mainland, and the first night victory over Australia. As of 24Â December, the unit's strength was twenty-four Kittyhawks.
