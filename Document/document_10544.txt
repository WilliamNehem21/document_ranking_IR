On the other hand, Lindemann may have left his battle position when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and before the deadly hit on the direction position, so as to give the order to surrender the ship. The enduring "Matrose" Paul HillenÃ¢ÂÂwho had figured out how to disappear to the upper deck in the last period of the fight, expressed that he had seen a gathering of 20Ã¢ÂÂ 30 individuals remaining at the bow, among them a man with a white topped top. Regularly on a German maritime vessel adrift, a white top is worn just by the boss. Also, the enduring "Maschinengefreiter"Ã¢ÂÂ Rudolf RÃÂ¶mer, who at the time was at that point in the waterÃ¢ÂÂguaranteed that he had seen Lindemann remaining on the bow, close "Bismarck"s forward 38ÃÂ cm turret, "Anton". He was said to be with his battle delivery person, a main sailor, and obviously endeavoring to influence his delegate to spare himself. In this record, his detachment grasped Lindemann's hand and the two strolled to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood quickly to consideration, at that point Lindemann and his flag-bearer saluted. As the ship moved to port, the envoy fell into the water. Lindemann proceeded with his salute while sticking to the flagmast, running under with the ship.
