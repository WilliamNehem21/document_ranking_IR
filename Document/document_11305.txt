Macaulay's best season regarding wickets was 1925, in spite of an extremely dry summer which created a progression of good batting pitches. He took 211 wickets at a normal of 15.48, coming top of the Yorkshire midpoints. Precisely 200 of his wickets were taken for YorkshireÃ¢ÂÂjust Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst had recently achieved 200 wickets for Yorkshire, and just Bob Appleyard has done as such since, starting at 2013. One of Macaulay's most noteworthy profile exhibitions in 1925 sought Yorkshire against Sussex, who were pursuing 263 to win. Soon after lunch on the last day, the score was 223 for three wickets. A conceivably fanciful story recommends that Macaulay savored champagne the interim. He at that point conveyed a spell of five wickets for eight keeps running in 33 balls to bowl out his adversaries and completion with figures of seven for 67. He at that point left the field depleted. The cricket history specialist Mick Pope portrays the match as an "enduring declaration to [Macaulay's] conviction that no reason was ever lost". Macaulay was again chosen for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, and took five wickets in the match. With the bat, Macaulay scored 621 keeps running at a normal of 23.88, despite the fact that he just passed fifty twice.
