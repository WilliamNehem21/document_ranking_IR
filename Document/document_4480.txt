The unearthings uncovered data about the entombments did inside the congregation and the devout structures, and in the encompassing grounds. They are viewed as "either those of Augustinian ordinances, special individuals from their lay family unit, or of imperative individuals from the Dutton family". Most entombments were in stone boxes or in wooden boxes with stone tops, and had been done from the late 12thÃÂ century up to the season of the disintegration. The site of the internment relied upon the status of the individual, regardless of whether they were administrative or lay, and their level of significance. Priors, abbots, and high-positioning standards were covered inside the congregation, with those towards the east end of the congregation being the most essential. Different ordinances were covered in a burial ground outside the congregation, in a region toward the south and east of the chancel. Individuals from the common people were covered either in the congregation, towards the west end of the nave or in the north walkway, or outside the congregation around its west end. It is conceivable that there was a lay burial ground toward the north and west of the congregation. The expansion of the houses of prayer toward the north transept, and their development, was completed for the Dutton family, making it their entombment sanctuary, or family tomb, and the most astounding convergence of internments was found in this piece of the congregation. It is viewed as that the north path, worked after the monastery turned into a convent, was added to give an entombment spot to individuals from the common people.
