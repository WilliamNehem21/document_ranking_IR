On 6 June 1950 Jacques was cast in the first episode of the weekly radio show "Educating Archie" as Agatha Dinglebody. The "Archie" of the title was the ventriloquist's dummy Archie Andrews, operated by Peter Brough. The first series ran for 29 weeks until 19 December. In the show Jacques appeared alongside Max Bygraves, Julie Andrews, Beryl Reid andâin the second seriesâTony Hancock. It was on this programme that she first worked with Eric Sykes, who was providing scripts for the series. Sykes had been impressed with Jacques since he visited the Players' in 1948. He later wrote that she "moved about the stage with an elegance and grace as if she owned it. At the end of her act, to great applause, she leapt in the air, finishing in the splits, landing as softly as a snowflake in July". After the show Sykes was introduced to Jacques backstage and thought that the meeting was "the beginning of a new flight" in his professional life. At the end of the series Jacques returned to the Players' to appear in the Christmas pantomime, "Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves", which she and Joan Sterndale-Bennett had adapted after they had copied it out long-hand at the British Museum. The reviewer in "The Times" thought that Jacques was "as appealing as last year", in her performance as Ali Baba's wife, Cogia.
