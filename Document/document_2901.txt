In the spring of 1945, JevÃÂeviÃÂ fled to Italy, where he was captured by Allied powers and kept at a camp in Grottaglie. An expected 10,000 Chetniks purportedly tailed him and ÃÂujiÃÂ into the nation. JevÃÂeviÃÂ was interned in Grottaglie for quite a while alongside others, including the previous UstaÃÂ¡e chief for Banja Luka, Viktor GutiÃÂ. Amid this time, a prosecution was issued against him in Sarajevo. It charged that under his direction in "the main portion of October 1942 in and around Prozor [the Italians and Chetniks] butchered and murdered 1,716 people of both genders, of the Croatian and Muslim countries, and ravaged and consumed around 500 families". JevÃÂeviÃÂ got significant Allied help in Italy in spite of being needed by British experts regarding these claims. On paper, the Chetniks in Italy were recorded as "surrendered foe work force", however were to a great extent seen with compassion by the Allies, who thought about them hostile to German. Henceforth, numerous Chetnik detainees were given British Army outfits and given non-soldier obligations all through Italy, for example, guarding weapons and supplies. In August 1945, JevÃÂeviÃÂ turned into the administrator of a camp for incapacitated Chetniks in Cesena. He was in the end set free and Yugoslavia's solicitations for removal were disregarded.
