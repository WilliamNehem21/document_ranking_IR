On 18 March 1922, the organization of FT light tanks partook in its first battle activity, amid the Rif War. Requested to work with the Spanish Legion, the power was to catch the town of Tunguntz, in Northern Morocco. Astonishing the protectors with their appearance, the heavily clad organization progressed, and the legionnaires behind, and caught the town of Anvar. Progressing towards Tunguntz, the tanks started to go under substantial discharge, as their development had detached them from the legionnaires because of the speed. Subsequently, the tanks were compelled to pull back to Anvar to fall back on the insurance of the infantry. Two FTs were relinquished by their team on account of mechanical issues and were later obliterated by the Moroccan protectors with explosive. A post-activity investigation of the activity chose that the poor execution of the tanks organization was an immediate aftereffect of poor collaboration with the infantry, the absence of dependability of the tanks' automatic rifles and the absence of earlier preparing before being hurried to the front. From there on, Spain's defensively covered organization was utilized consistently in little scale tasks between late 1922 and September 1925. On 8 September 1925, Spain's reinforcement would partake in the principal land and/or water capable arriving with tanks ever.
