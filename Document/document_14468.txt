In late 1905, Roosevelt got a duplicate of Long's book "Northern Trails" from the distributer. In light of the creator's movements in Canada, the greater part of the accounts included an honorable, white wolf named Wayeeses. As in different works, Long stated that "each episode in this current wolf's life, from his grasshopper chasing to the shrewdness caribou pursue, and from the lair in the stones to the gathering of wolf and kids on the tempest cleared barrens, is minutely valid indeed, and depends soundly upon my own perceptions and that of my Indians." While Roosevelt allegedly appreciated a dominant part of the bookÃ¢ÂÂhe even perused it so anyone might hear to his kidsÃ¢ÂÂhe criticized Long's sensational portrayal of how a wolf killed caribou by piercing the creature's heart with its teeth. "A fantastic surge," Long wrote in "Northern Trails", "a fast snap under the stag's chest simply behind the fore legs, where the heart lay". Drawing upon his very own broad chasing background, Roosevelt composed secretly to the book's distributer about Long's depiction being "sheer jabber", reasoning that it "is so strange" and anatomically outlandish that it couldn't be valid. In his letter, of which he likewise sent a duplicate to Burroughs, Roosevelt called attention to the physical trouble a wolf would have if endeavoring to murder its prey in such a way, while additionally remarking upon the implausibility of other wolf stories composed by Long.
