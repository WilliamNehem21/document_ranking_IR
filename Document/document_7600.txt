After that intersection, NYÃÂ 22 twists back toward the north, paralleling I-684 as a thin, shaded wandering two-path rustic course through the Westchester wide open of vast lush parcels and houses all around screened from the street. In downtown Bedford, the main settlement since White Plains, the expressway covers with NYÃÂ 172 for a mile (1.6ÃÂ km), its first simultaneousness with an east-west course, at that point veers back toward the northwest at the focal point of town. Just toward the north, NYÃÂ 121, the main northÃ¢ÂÂ south state interstate whose course is completely east of NYÃÂ 22, forks off from its southern end. Another mile past that, RouteÃÂ 22 comes back to a due-north heading, passing the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site a National Historic Landmark, where it turns west quickly, and Harvey School, where it bends toward the northwest once more. After the Katonah Museum of Art it broadens quickly at a noteworthy convergence with NYÃÂ 35. north of that intersection, NYÃÂ 22 winds up parallel with I-684 into the Town of Somers and the villa of Goldens Bridge. On the opposite side of the Interstate, open by means of NYÃÂ 138, is the Goldens Bridge station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which starts a long parallel arrangement with NYÃÂ 22 now.
