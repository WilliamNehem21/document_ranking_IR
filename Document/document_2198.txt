The Douglas Aircraft Company structured a framework that would keep the unintentional inversion of propeller sharp edges in-flight. Amid improvement of the DC-6, the organization introduced a framework that slice electrical capacity to the systems which pivoted the cutting edges while the plane was noticeable all around. At the point when there was sufficient load on the arrival gear (which would possibly be the situation when the flying machine was on the ground), a switch which provided electrical capacity to the systems was shutÃ¢ÂÂimplying that when the air ship contacted down the cutting edges could be turned around and along these lines the plane could be impeded. At the point when the switch was shut, a warning would swing into view in the cockpit of the flying machine, cautioning the group that the sharp edges could be turned around. Should the change neglect to close after finding, the banner could be raised physically and electrical capacity to the instruments would be reestablished. At the point when the air ship took off, electrical power would be sliced to the systems with the goal that the propeller sharp edges couldn't be coincidentally switched, and the warning swung far out. Invert push cautioning lights, which would have cautioned the group if the propellers were turned around, were not fitted on "Mainliner Idaho".
