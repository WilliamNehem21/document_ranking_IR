The year 1902 began with the same routine of training operations as in previous years for the ships of the I Squadron. The last ironclad finally left the squadron in February, having been replaced by "Kaiser Friedrich III"s newly commissioned sister ship . The squadron began a major training cruise on 25 April; that day, while the ships were passing through the Danish straits, a serious boiler accident occurred aboard "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse", forcing her to turn back for repairs. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the rest of the squadron continued into the North Sea, toward Scotland. They passed through the Pentland Firth on 29 April before turning south toward Ireland. The ships stopped briefly in Lough Swilly on 1 May before proceeding to Bantry Bay, where they anchored off Berehaven five days later. There, Prince Heinrich visited his British cousin, Prince Arthur, and the ships were received by the British Channel Squadron. The German vessels then steamed to Dublin, and then to the Isles of Scilly, where "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" rejoined the squadron. They returned to Dublin, where they were visited by Gerald Cadogan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The ships finally began their return voyage to Germany on 24 May, and reached Kiel four days later.
