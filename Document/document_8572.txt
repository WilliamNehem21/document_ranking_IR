In 2007 Strmiska noticed that a "little yet developing" number of Heathen experts in the U.S. had started performing creature penance as a piece of "blÃÂ³t". Such Heathens think about the butchered creature as a blessing to the divine beings, and here and there likewise as a "voyager" who is taking a message to the gods. Gatherings who perform such forfeits regularly pursue the methodology illustrated in the "Heimskringla": the throat of the conciliatory creature is cut with a sharp blade, and the blood is gathered in a bowl before being sprinkled onto the two members of the ceremony and statues of the divine beings. Creatures utilized for this reason have included poultry just as bigger vertebrates like sheep and pigs, with the meat at that point being devoured by those going to the ceremony. A few specialists have made adjustments to this methodology: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who chose to utilize a rifle shot to the head to murder the creature quickly, a choice made after they saw a "blÃÂ³t" in which the creature's throat was cut inaccurately and it gradually passed on in misery; they felt that such practices would have disappointed the divine beings and appropriately brought mischief upon those doing the penance.
