Expressions, which Playford demonstrated no close to home enthusiasm for, and viewed as "ornamentations not basics" and "non-gainful", turned into a progressively unmistakable issue among the developing white collar class. For his frame of mind, Playford was frequently taunted by his rivals and pundits for his "philistinism". The "Country" derisorily joked that "It is proverbial that the Premier draws his plantation shower firearm at the notice of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, a LCL individual from the upper house, scrutinized the destruction of the Theater Royal, campaigned Playford for expanded financing without progress, bringing up that world-class performing expressions scenes were commonly sponsored by the administration. Plunge Morphett, a previous State President of the LCL, joked that if Playford "had needed to change over the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would have done it decisively". During the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival began, while the Australian Dance Theater and the State Theater Company of South Australia was established in the capital, with insignificant help from Playford's legislature. The celebration was generally welcomed in spite of the impact of control in a state understood for social conservatism. With the achievement of the celebration, open enthusiasm for expressions expanded, and with expanding calls for government financing, especially from Dunstan, Playford at last consented to finance the "non-beneficial region" in 1963 by distributing subsidizing for the possible structure of the Festival Center.
