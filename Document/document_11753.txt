Spotnitz needed "Deadalive" to open in a way that would stun watchers and make them watch the whole scene. He presumed that the most ideal approach to do this was to demonstrate Mulder's memorial service. He felt that "the demise of the legend [of the series] was sufficiently stunning", however that nobody expected "Deadalive" to conspicuously open with a memorial service. He expounded, "Yet here we are really covering the man ... simply driving something to the extent you can on the grounds that the group of onlookers can't exactly accept no doubt about it." The memorial service was costly to film; a few performers, for example, Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mom, should have been flown in explicitly for the scene. Spotnitz later stated, "It's a ton of cash to spend at the same time, you know, you just couldn't generally do Mulder's memorial service without having them there, so we did all that." Despite the way that the show was recorded in California and under "tremendous budgetary weight", genuine snow was utilized for frontal area shots and the foundation was painted white in after generation. Spotnitz later called the succession "a fun scene to compose and organize" and "an extraordinary bother".
