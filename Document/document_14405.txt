The head of "Gallimimus" was exceptionally little and light contrasted with the vertebral segment. Because of the length of its nose, the skull was for quite some time contrasted with different ornithomimids, and the nose had a tenderly inclining upper profile; this was less unmistakable in adolescent examples. The side profile of the nose varied from different ornithomimids in not narrowing towards its front half, and the lower front edge of the premaxilla at the front of the upper jaw climbed upwards, rather than being even. Seen from over, the nose was practically spatulate (spoon-molded), wide and adjusted at the tip (or U-formed), while it was intense (or V-formed) in North American ornithomimids. The circles (eye attachments) were expansive and confronted sideways, as in different ornithomimids. The worldly locale along the edge of the skull behind the eyes was profound, and the infratemporal fenestra (the lower opening behind the circle) was about triangular and littler than that of the related "Struthiomimus". It had profound muscle scars at the back piece of the skull rooftop, along the parietal bone. The parasphenoid (a bone at the underside of the skull's base) was flimsy walled, empty and framed a pear-molded, bulbous structure. The structure had a shallow wrinkle which opened at the base of the skull. The inward nares (inside openings for the nasal entry) were substantial and set far back on the sense of taste, because of the nearness of a broad optional sense of taste, which was basic to ornithomimids.
