The war proceeded through the remainder of 1675 and into the following year. The English were continually disappointed by the Native Americans' refusal to meet them in pitched fight. They utilized a type of guerilla fighting that bewildered the English. Skipper Benjamin Church persistently crusaded to enroll the assistance of well disposed Native Americans to help figure out how to battle on a notwithstanding balance with Philip's warrior groups, however he was continually rebuked by the Plymouth authority who questioned every Native American, supposing them potential foes. In the long run, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military administrator Major William Bradford (child of the late Governor William Bradford) yielded and gave Church consent to sort out a joined power of English and Native Americans. In the wake of verifying the collusion of the Sakonnet, he drove his joined power in quest for Philip, who had so far kept away from any significant fights in the war that bears his name. All through July 1676, Church's band caught many Native American warriors, regularly without quite a bit of a battle, however Philip escaped him. Church was offered consent to concede absolution to any caught Native Americans who might consent to join the English side, and his power developed monstrously. Philip was executed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war before long finished as a mind-boggling English triumph.
