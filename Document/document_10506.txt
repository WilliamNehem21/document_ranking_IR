In 1992, Panavision propelled a task to build up a camera that included reexamining each part of the organization's current 35ÃÂ mm framework. Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer Sr. headed up the plan group. The new Millennium camera, supplanting the Platinum as the organization's leader, was presented in 1997. The Millennium XL went to the market in 1999 and was driven by Al Mayer, Jr. It before long settled itself as Panavision's new 35mm workhorse. The XL was the primary item in Panavision history to win both an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award inside the main year of authority discharge. The update to the XL, the XL2 was at first discharged in 2004.[26] . The main component movies to utilize these last two frameworks were, individually, "The Perfect Storm" (2000) and "Simply Like Heaven" (2005). The XL arrangement not just had an a lot littler camera bodyÃ¢ÂÂmaking it appropriate for studio, handheld, and steadicam workÃ¢ÂÂyet in addition denoted the main huge change to the film transport system in the camera since the Panaflex: two littler sprocket drums for feed and take-up (a plan like the Moviecam and ensuing Arricam) rather than one extensive drum to do both. Starting at 2006, Panavision has no further designs to build up extra film camera models.
