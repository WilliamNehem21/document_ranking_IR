New decisions must be held for burgess and for representative to the tradition which had been called by the back end of the broke down House of Burgesses, and Fairfax County's were set for July 5, 1774. Washington intended to keep running for one seat, and endeavored to get Mason or Bryan Fairfax to look for the other, yet the two men declined. In spite of the fact that the survey was deferred to the fourteenth because of poor climate, Washington met that day with other nearby pioneers (counting, likely, Mason) in Alexandria and chose a panel to draft a lot of goals, which Washington trusted would "characterize our Constitutional Rights". The subsequent Fairfax Resolves were to a great extent drafted by Mason. He met with the recently chosen Washington on July 17 at Mount Vernon, and remained the night; the two men rode together to Alexandria the next day. The 24 suggestions that made up the Resolves dissented dependability to the British Crown, yet precluded the privilege from claiming Parliament to administer for provinces that had been settled at private cost and which had gotten sanctions from the ruler. The Resolves required a mainland congress. On the off chance that Americans did not get review by November 1, trades, including that of tobacco, would be cut off. The freeholders of Fairfax County endorsed the Resolves, designating Mason and Washington to an exceptional advisory group in the crisis. As indicated by early Virginia student of history Hugh Grigsby, at Alexandria, Mason "made his first incredible development on the performance center of the Revolution".
