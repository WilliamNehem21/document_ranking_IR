Gabbar Singh, the film's adversary, was generally welcomed by the gathering of people, in spite of his inescapable perverted brutality. Dissanayake clarifies that the crowd was interested by the exchanges and characteristics of the character, and this component of display exceeded his activities, a first for Indian acting. He noticed that the picturisation of savagery in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, not at all like prior melodramas in which the female body involves the group of onlookers' consideration as an object of male obsession, in "Sholay", the male body turns into the focal point. It turns into the battleground where great and wickedness go after matchless quality. Dissanayake contends that "Sholay" can be seen as a national purposeful anecdote: it comes up short on an ameliorating intelligent account, it demonstrates social dependability being over and over tested, and it demonstrates the degrading of human life coming about because of an absence of feelings. Taken together, these components contain the symbolic portrayal of India. The account style of "Sholay", with its brutality, retribution, and vigilante activity, is infrequently contrasted by researchers with the political turmoil in India at the season of its discharge. This strain finished in the Emergency (rule by declaration) pronounced by leader Indira Gandhi in 1975.
