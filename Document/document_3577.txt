All populaces are transient, and most flying creatures winter in Africa south of the Sahara, with only a couple of records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Movement is fundamentally around evening time, independently or in free gatherings of up to twenty winged creatures. European reproducers cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, though eastern populaces travel through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian winged animals may along these lines cross 100ÃÂ° of longitude on their movements. Most flying creatures winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, despite the fact that people of the designate race have been as of late found wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records somewhere else in West Africa might winter flying creatures of this subspecies or "C. e. meridionalis". Most fall movement happens from August to September, and the winged creatures come back to the reproducing grounds by May. Late following information has uncovered that European nightjars have a circle movement from Western Europe to sub-central Africa where they need to cross a few biological hindrances (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). People utilize comparative stop-over destinations as do other European vagrants. Vagrants have happened in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.
