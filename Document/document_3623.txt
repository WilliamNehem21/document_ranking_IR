Vrba and Wetzler went through the night in ÃÂadca in the home of a relative of the rabbi Leo Baeck, before being take to ÃÂ½ilina via train, where they were met at the station by Erwin Steiner, an individual from the Jewish Council, and taken to the Jewish Old People's Home, where the gathering had workplaces. Over the next days, they were acquainted with Ibolya Steiner (who was hitched to Erwin); Oskar Krasniansky, a designer and stenographer (who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel), and, on 25 April, the administrator of the board, Dr. Oskar Neumann, a legal advisor. In his journal, Wetzler portrayed (utilizing pen names) individuals who went to the principal meeting: a legal counselor (probably Neumann), an assembly line laborer, a "Madame Ibi" (Ibolya Steiner) who had been a functionary in a dynamic youth association, and the Prague reporter of a Swiss paper. The legal advisor disclosed to them the gathering had been trusting that somebody will affirm the bits of gossip they had caught wind of Auschwitz. Wetzler was amazed by the naÃÂ¯vety of the attorney's inquiry: "Is it so hard to get out [of] there?" The writer needed to know how they had overseen it, on the off chance that it was so difficult. Wetzler felt Vrba lean forward furiously to state something, yet he snatched his hand and Vrba stepped back.
