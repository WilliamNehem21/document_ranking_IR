Since the beginning Lancaster had been intrigued by design. He reviewed his first trek to Venice and the "stunning" perspective on San Giorgio Maggiore from the Piazzetta, and as a young fellow he went on what he portrayed as "chapel slithers" with Betjeman. His anxiety for compositional legacy drove him to compose and draw what Knox portrays as "a progression of structural polemics in the appearance of incapacitating 'picture books'". Harold Nicolson said of Lancaster's work in this circle, "Under that luxurious, harsh grin there untruths the enthusiasm of an impassioned reformer ... a most clever and engaging book. Yet, it is more than that. It is a clear rundown of a most imperative subject". Four of Lancaster's books are in this class: "Advancement at Pelvis Bay" parodies obtuse organizers and voracious engineers; "Column to Post" represents and examinations the outsides of structures from old occasions to the present; "Homes Sweet Homes" does likewise for the insides. "Drayneflete Revealed" is in a similar vein as "Advancement at Pelvis Bay". In these Lancaster utilizes something of the method he recommended for stage configuration: showing a somewhat elevated rendition of the real world. The bent segments in the "Elaborate" area are not drawn legitimately from genuine florid structures, however are the craftsman's refining of the numerous models he has seen and outlined. By such methods, he set out to make the overall population mindful of good structures, and "the present sad territory of English design".
