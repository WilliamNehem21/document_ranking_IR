Stengel doled out veteran players to work with Martin and be his flat mate on excursions; at first Mel Duezabou, an understudy of the specialty of hitting with a lifetime small time batting normal more than .300, who improved Martin at the plate. Later in the season, Duezabou was supplanted with Cookie Lavagetto, a kindred infielder and previous Dodgers star who had the capacity to assist Martin with handling and exhort him on what's in store in the real alliances. As wounds exhausted the Oaks' regulars, Martin got expanding playing time, and completed the season with a .277 batting normal, 3 grand slams and 42 runs batted in. He turned into a group chief, dynamic in fights on the field and a noisy and irritating seat racer in a period when a player regularly needed to battle with a flood of affront from the contradicting group's hole. The Oaks won the PCL flag and the Governors' Cup playoffs. Martin's reward for the title was another vehicle, purchased by Laws, yet to his misery, Stengel's reward was the director's activity with the New York Yankees, leaving Martin feeling deserted. He was particularly crippled on the grounds that his deep rooted want was to be a Yankee.
