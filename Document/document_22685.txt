The game also set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow. GameDaily listed the game as one of the "Most Influential Video Games" and stated it "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings". "GamesTM" noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to "Super Mario 64". Members of Rare, a second-party developer for Nintendo during the 1990s, reflected in 2013 that during the development of 2001's "Conker's Bad Fur Day", they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of "Super Mario 64": "We were just copying "Mario", weren't we? Which, to this day, is still the best 3D camera." "Super Mario 64" is notable for its sense of freedom and non-linearity. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design is an inspiration for other game designers. Martin Hollis, who produced and directed Rare's "GoldenEye 007", says "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from "Super Mario 64"". In 2012, Dan Houser, a prominent figure in the development of the "Grand Theft Auto" series, stated, "Anyone who makes 3D games who says they've not borrowed something from "Mario" or "Zelda" [on the Nintendo 64] is lying." Tetsuya Nomura, a leading designer at Square Enix, stated in 2016 that "Super Mario 64" was the impetus for the creation of the "Kingdom Hearts" series.
