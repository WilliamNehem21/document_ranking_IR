On 1 January 1920, Wrigley exchanged to the Australian Air Corps (AAC), a brief association framed by the Army following disbandment of the wartime AFC. He was selected assistant at Central Flying School the next month. In 1921, Wrigley joined the recently settled Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flight lieutenant. Prevalently known as "Wrig", he was one of the first twenty-one officers reporting in real time Force's quality at its development that March. For the following seven years he held staff posts at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, starting with the situation of staff officer to the Director of Personnel and Training. On 5ÃÂ July 1922, Wrigley wedded Marjorie Rees; the couple had a child and a little girl. That month, he supplanted Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara as Staff Officer (Operations and Intelligence). He filled in as RAAF Training Officer from March 1923 to April 1925Ã¢ÂÂamid which time he was elevated to squadron pioneerÃ¢ÂÂbefore being selected Director of Organization and Staff Duties. In November 1927, he partook trying to make the main night departure from Sydney to Melbourne. Taking off from RAAF Station Richmond in an Airco DH.9, Wrigley and his co-pilot were noticeable all around for six hours and secured before a broken fuel line constrained them to arrive for fixes; they finished the adventure the next day.
