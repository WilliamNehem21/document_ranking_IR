Savige landed in Australia on 5ÃÂ January 1942 to find that his new arrangement had been changed to leader of the 3rdÃÂ Division, and he was elevated to the position of real broad two days after the fact. The flare-up of war with Japan incited a discount rearrangement of the powers in Australia and Savige was one of various officers with involvement in the Middle East who was advanced and given direction of a Home Army arrangement. Savige devoted himself completely to the assignment of setting up his order for the war, removing the physically unfit and bumbling. By May, he had evacuated some 60ÃÂ officers. Supplanting them was another issue. The division was at not exactly half quality when Savige accepted direction and was loaded up with expansive quantities of 18-year-old recruits. One fresh debut was particularly welcome: Lieutenant Colonel John Wilton, who was posted as General Service Officer, First Grade (GSO1) in August. Savige later reviewed that "I never had an increasingly able staff, nor such a co-usable group, than that staff after Wilton went along." The 3rdÃÂ Division moved to southern Queensland in July, where it went under Lieutenant General Edmund Herring's IIÃÂ Corps. In October, Herring succeeded Rowell as officer of New Guinea Force, and Savige ended up acting corps authority. With his consideration concentrated on the corps, Savige depended on Wilton to administer the preparation of the third Division.
