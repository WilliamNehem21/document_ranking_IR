The objective of "Lost Coast" was to exhibit the new high-dynamic-run rendering actualized into the Source diversion motor. Valve previously endeavored to execute high-dynamic-go rendering in Source in late 2003. The principal technique put away surfaces in RGBA shading space, taking into account multisample hostile to associating and pixel shaders to be utilized, yet this anticipated alpha mapping and haze impacts from working legitimately, just as influencing surfaces to seem sharp and rough. The second strategy included sparing two forms of a surface: one with customary information, and the other with overbrightening information. Notwithstanding, this method did not consider multisample against associating and devoured twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third technique, appeared at the E3 tradition in 2005, utilized gliding guide information toward characterize the RGB shading space, taking into account sensibly proficient capacity of the high-dynamic-extend information. Be that as it may, this technique likewise did not take into account multisample against associating, and was just good with Nvidia video cards, departing ATI cards unfit to run high unique range. The fourth and last technique bargained between the second and third strategies, utilizing overbrightening surfaces sparingly and permitting ATI cards to render HDR distinctively to the Nvidia ones while about creating a similar final product.
