The red wattlebird is found in southeast Queensland, where it happens south of Noosa and Cooloola, ending up increasingly regular south of Brisbane and Toowoomba. Further south into New South Wales it is discovered most places east of (and including) the Great Dividing Range and extending west toward the southern North-West Plain, Central Western Slopes and eastern Riverina, and is an intermittent guest to focuses along the Murray River valley. It is found crosswise over Victoria, however is exceptional in the northwest of the state. In South Australia, Devonborough Downs Station, Manunda, Wilpena Pound and Nullarbor Station mark the northern furthest reaches of its range. There are dispersed records from the Nullarbor Plain, yet the species is normal in Western Australia west of 125ÃÂ ÃÂ°E and south of 29ÃÂ ÃÂ°S. The yellow wattlebird replaces it in Tasmania. The red wattlebird has turned out to be progressively basic in certain areas, for example, the Sunraysia region during the 1960s and Nambucca Heads and Lefevre Peninsula during the 1980s. Numbers reproducing have expanded in Sydney and Adelaide. The red wattlebird is an uncommon vagrant to New Zealand, with affirmed records at Matakana in 1865 and Rohutu, Taranaki in 1885, and a third unsubstantiated from Motupiko in 1938.
