Idaho, a mining state, was loaded with work strains, and related savagery was basic by the two managers and specialists. In 1899, there was a strike, and a vast gathering of diggers dynamited offices having a place with a mining organization that would not perceive the association. They had captured a train to go to demolish the organization's plant. Somebody in the crowd shot and murdered a strikebreaker. Senator Frank Steunenberg pronounced military law and had more than one thousand excavators captured. Paul Corcoran, secretary of the association, was accused of homicide. Borah was locked in as an investigator in a preliminary that started at Wallace on July 8, 1899. Indictment witnesses vouched for having seen Corcoran sitting over the train, rifle close by, and later jumping to the stage. The safeguard battled that, given the sharp bends and unpleasant roadbed of the rail line, nobody could have sat over the train, nor hopped from it without extreme damage. Borah took the jury to the train line and showed how Corcoran could have acted. He drew on his abilities as a young rail rider to ride the highest point of the train, and bounce from it to the stage without damage. Corcoran was indicted, yet his capital punishment was driven. He was exonerated in 1901, after Steunenberg left office. Borah increased wide recognition for his sensational indictment of the case.
