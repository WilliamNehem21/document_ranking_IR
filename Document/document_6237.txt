At the point when Michael Moorcock, who at this point had started pitching stories to Carnell, knew about the designs to stop production of "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy", he composed a letter that showed up in issue 141 mourning the misfortune to the British sci-fi field of both the magazines and Carnell himself. Carnell did not have any desire to keep on editting the magazines notwithstanding "New Writings in SF", and prescribed Moorcock to Warburton. Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford craftsmanship seller who was a companion of Brian Aldiss, likewise communicated an intrigue. Warburton gave Moorcock the decision of which magazine to alter; Moorcock picked "New Worlds", and Bonfiglioli turned into the new manager of "Science Fantasy". Moorcock needed to change to an expansive organization, and demonstrated Warburton a spurious issue he had made up, yet Warburton demanded a soft cover design so as to fit in with different titles they were creating, however he consented to return to the configuration later on if deals improved. The primary issue under Moorcock's control was number 142, dated May/June 1964. The calendar was at first every other month, however toward the beginning of 1965 it came back to a steady month to month plan.
