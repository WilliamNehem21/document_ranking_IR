The spit is a moderately youthful component in geographical terms, and in late hundreds of years it has been broadening westwards and landwards through tidal and storm activity. This development is thought to have been improved by the recovery of the salt swamps along this coast in late hundreds of years, which expelled a characteristic obstruction to the development of shingle. The measure of shingle moved by a solitary tempest can be "awesome"; the spit has at times been broken, turning into an island for a period, and this may happen once more. The northernmost piece of Snitterley (presently Blakeney) town was lost to the ocean in the early Middle Ages, presumably because of a tempest. In the last two hundred years, maps have been sufficiently precise for the separation from the Blakeney Chapel remnants to the ocean to be estimated. The 400ÃÂ m (440ÃÂ yd) in 1817 had turned out to be 320ÃÂ m (350ÃÂ yd) by 1835, 275ÃÂ m (300ÃÂ yd) in 1907, and 195ÃÂ m (215ÃÂ yd) before the finish of the twentieth century. The spit is moving towards the territory at about 1ÃÂ m (1ÃÂ yd) every year; and a few previous raised islands or "eyes" have just vanished, first secured by the propelling shingle, and afterward lost to the ocean. The enormous 1953 flood overran the primary shoreline, and just the most elevated hill tops stayed above water. Sand was washed into the salt bogs, and the outrageous tip of the fact was ruptured, however likewise with other simply regular pieces of the coast, as Scolt Head Island, small enduring harm was finished.
