St-Calais was brought before the ruler and regal court for preliminary on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the lord caught his properties. At the preliminary, St-Calais held that as a diocesan he couldn't be attempted in a common court, and would not answer the allegations. Lanfranc exhibited the ruler's case, proclaiming that the seized terrains had been held as fiefs, and consequently St-Calais could be attempted as a vassal, not as a religious administrator. St-Calais questioned, and kept on declining to answer the claims. After various meetings and exchanges, the court held that St-Calais could be attempted as a vassal in a medieval court. St-Calais at that point requested an intrigue to Rome, which was dismissed by the lord and the judges. Those making a decision about the case held that in light of the fact that St-Calais never addressed the formal allegation, and on the grounds that he spoke to Rome, his fief, or terrains, was relinquish. In spite of the fact that St-Calais professed to guard the privileges of pastorate to be attempted in administrative courts and to speak to Rome, his kindred priests accepted something else. Loaning backing to their conviction is the way that St-Calais never sought after his intrigue to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the ruler against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm attempted to state a privilege to speak to Rome.
