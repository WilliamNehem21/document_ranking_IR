Amid the Han line, the power an administration official practiced was dictated by his yearly pay rank, estimated in grain units known as "dan" (, a unit of volume, around ). Be that as it may, around a large portion of an official's pay in grain was made in installments of money coins, the standard of which, after 119 BC, was the "wushu" (Ã¤ÂºÂÃ©ÂÂ) coin estimating 3.2 g (0.11ÃÂ oz). The other portion of an official's compensation comprised of unhusked grain and husked grain estimated in "hu" (Ã¨Â§Â³, around 20 L/676 oz); since one "hu" of unhusked grain was equivalent to 100 coins and one "hu" of husked grain was equivalent to 160 coins, the transformation proportion for unhusked grain to husked grain was 10 to 6 (see table beneath). The most senior authorities in focal government earned a 10,000-"dan" pay. The authorities who administered nine particular services each earned the Fully 2,000-"dan" rank, while the officer of an area earned a 600-"dan" rank. Every so often, sovereigns presented rich blessings of wine, foodstuffs, and silk garments upon high authorities. These blessings, in some liberal cases, could equivalent as much as a large portion of the estimation of the authorities' standard yearly pay. Matured authorities were regularly resigned from administration and given a benefits. The following is a table plotting compensations estimated in coin money, unhusked grain, and husked grain for the most astounding to least paid authorities in Han officialdom:
