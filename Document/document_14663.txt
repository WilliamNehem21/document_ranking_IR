This topic resounded with different guests to the site. The American essayist Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and featured what she saw as the differentiation between "two masteries look[ing] at one another over the valley", the remains of Volubilis and "the cone shaped white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as speaking to "a framework, a request, a social origination that still goes through the entirety of our cutting edge ways." conversely, she saw the still particularly alive town of Moulay Idriss as "progressively dead and drew again into an incomprehensible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton considered Volubilis to be an image of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of boorishness; the subtext is that "in scouring the Roman station, Islam obliterated its solitary opportunity to manufacture a cultivated society". Luckily for Morocco, "the political dependability which France is helping them to get will finally give their higher characteristics time for fulfillment"Ã¢ÂÂ especially the topic that the French provincial experts needed to get over. Hilaire Belloc, as well, talked about his impression being "somewhat one of history and of differentiation. Here you perceive how totally the new religion of Islam overflowed and suffocated the established and Christian convention."
