By and large, Christgau ascribed the collection's prosperity to Saadiq's lead job in Tony! Toni! TonÃÂ©! He fought that "just with "Place of Music" did they become genuine children of the spirit recovery, the most practiced r&b demonstration of the '90s. That is as yet the collection to recall them by." AllMusic proofreader Leo Stanley later commented that the gathering "effectively achieve their combination of the customary and contemporaryÃÂ ... inside the structure of vital, appealing melodies" obliged to both old and current R&B songwriting ideals. As indicated by Stanley, the record had an impact on contemporary neo soul craftsmen, for example, Tony Rich and Maxwell. As Matos would like to think, the collection exhibited the expanding aesthetic difference among Saadiq and Wiggins, which "had developed so articulated that the pressure just upgraded what was at that point the gathering's best clump of tunes". Rashod Ollison of "The Virginian-Pilot" viewed the record as "a faultless jewel" on which the band's "amalgamation of customary and contemporary styles blended flawlessly". In "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" (2004), Fred Schruers said ""House of Music" combines the triumph of "Children of Soul" for an artful culmination of 1990s R&B, a collection that is as saturated with soul convention as anything by Maxwell or D'Angelo, however that blends the praise with diversion and deft contemporary contacts, in this way making another space all its own".
