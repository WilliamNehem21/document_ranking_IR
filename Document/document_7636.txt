One scene in Sebree's initial military history which impacted his later profession was his interest in the second "Polaris" salvage mission. The Polaris campaign was a 1871Ã¢ÂÂ 72 investigation of the Arctic that had intended to achieve the North Pole. The campaign was pained from the begin: its pioneer, Charles Francis Hall, kicked the bucket in secretive conditions before the finish of their first winter. The next year, the "Polaris" stayed caught in ice and unfit to return home. Amid a brutal tempest, the team was isolated into two gatherings: a little gathering of voyagers was stranded on the now-injured "Polaris" and the rest of marooned on an ice floe. These last 19 survivors were found by shot and protected by the non military personnel whaler . In view of the "Tigress'" prosperity, the Navy contracted the ship, briefly rechristened her USS "Tigress", and utilized her to dispatch a salvage endeavor to find the rest of the team. For this endeavor the ship would be told by a gathering of eight naval force officers, driven by Captain James A. Greer, albeit a great part of the first non military personnel group was held. Lieutenant Sebree was one of the officers picked for the mission.
