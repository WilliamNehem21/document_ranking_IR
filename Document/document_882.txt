This consideration of the fabulous, nonetheless, is for the most part a structure by which the creator talks about human instinct and society. One faultfinder proposes that "the story would be much the equivalent without it". Balzac had utilized powerful components in the potboiler books he distributed under "pen names", yet their quality in "Peau de vexation" flagged a defining moment in his way to deal with the utilization of imagery. While he had utilized fabulous items and occasions in prior works, they were for the most part basic plot focuses or uncomplicated gadgets for tension. With "La Peau de mortification", then again, the charm speaks to Valentin's spirit; in the meantime, his downfall is emblematic of a more prominent social decrease. Balzac's genuine foci in the 1831 novel are the intensity of human want and the idea of society after the July Revolution. French author and faultfinder FÃÂ©licien Marceau even recommends that the imagery in the novel permits a cleaner investigation than the individual contextual investigations of other Balzac books; by expelling the examination to a dynamic dimension, it turns out to be less convoluted by varieties of individual identity. As an everyman, Valentin shows the basic attributes of human instinct, not a specific individual's way to deal with the difficulty offered by the skin.
