The Macdonald government found a way to advance the travel industry as a method for carrying cash into the area. It improved conditions for sightseers by allowing little credits to inn, motel and house proprietors to update their offices. It likewise offered cooking classes to eatery and lodging workers. The administration's broad street building program made it simpler for voyagers to travel. In any case, biographer Stephen Henderson composes that Macdonald went well past these down to earth ventures to advance Nova Scotia as an excellent and natural spot inhabited by vivid Scots, Acadians, Germans and Mi'kmaq. Government publicizing depicted the territory "as a spot where urban, white collar class families could go to 'venture back in time'". Steadily, Henderson keeps up, the travel industry crusades made another character for Nova Scotians. "They saw the commonplace state building a detailed system of present day streets; they read books and pamphlets lauding the magnificence of the area, and they heard their head waxing impractically about the unadulterated, straightforward respectability of their progenitors." Macdonald was particularly excited about "the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots". Student of history Ian McKay composes that under his administration, the commonplace government offered cash to the Gaelic College; gave Scottish names on key the travel industry destinations and positioned "a sturdy Scots flautist" at the fringe with New Brunswick. Macdonald likewise amassed in excess of a fourth of a million sections of land (4,000ÃÂ km) for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park total with an extravagant retreat lodging and world-class fairway. "Macdonald trusted", Henderson states, "he had made a bit of Scotland for vacationers in the New World". What's more, as more travelers came, Macdonald's stature developed.
