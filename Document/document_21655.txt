The animal's name alludes to pigs in many European languages. The German word for them is "Meerschweinchen", literally "little sea pig", which has been translated into Polish as "Åwinka morska", into Hungarian as "tengerimalac", and into Russian as "Ð¼Ð¾ÑÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÑÐ²Ð¸Ð½ÐºÐ°". This derives from the Middle High German name "merswin". This originally meant "dolphin" and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which were thought to be similar). Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist. For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The French term is "cochon d'Inde" (Indian pig) or "cobaye"; the Dutch call it "Guinees biggetje" (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called "Spaanse rat"); and in Portuguese, the guinea pig is variously referred to as "cobaia", from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as "porquinho da Ãndia" (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is "conejillo de Indias" (little rabbit of the Indies). The Chinese refer to them as è±é¼  ("tÃºnshÇ", 'pig mouse'), and sometimes as Netherlands pig (è·è­è±¬, "hÃ©lÃ¡nzhÅ«") or Indian mouse (å¤©ç«ºé¼ , "tiÄnzhÃºshÇ"). The Japanese word for guinea pig is "ã¢ã«ã¢ãã" ("morumotto"), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the marmot; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843. The other Japanese word for guinea pig, using kanji, is "tenjiku-nezumi" (å¤©ç«ºé¼ , or ã¦ãããã­ãã¿), which literally translates as "India rat".
