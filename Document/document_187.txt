Henry sold his property in Prince Edward County in 1792, moving with his family to Long Island, a manor in Campbell County. In 1794 Henry bought Red Hill close Brookneal, Virginia in Charlotte County, where he and his family lived a significant part of the year, however they moved to Long Island in the "wiped out season". Henry was delighted at the race of his old companion John Adams as president in 1796 over his enemy Jefferson, yet Henry's responsibility to the Federalist Party was tried by the oppressive Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. He said nothing, yet bolstered the battle of Marshall, a moderate Federalist, for the House of Representatives; Marshall won barely. Henry was under extensive weight from Virginia Federalists to come back to governmental issues, however it was not until previous president Washington encouraged him to keep running for the assembly in mid 1799 that Henry gave in. Diverting down an idea from President Adams to make him an agent to France, Henry was chosen as representative from Charlotte County on March 4, 1799. The assembly had no prompt session planned, so he came back to Red Hill, and never left again, kicking the bucket there of stomach disease at his home on June 6, 1799. He was covered at Red Hill.
