After "Some Like It Hot", Monroe took another rest until late 1959, when she came back to Hollywood and featured in the melodic parody "How about we Make Love", around an on-screen character and a tycoon who experience passionate feelings for when performing in a humorous play. She picked George Cukor to direct and Miller re-composed bits of the content, which she thought about frail; she acknowledged the part exclusively in light of the fact that she was behind on her agreement with Fox, having just made one of four guaranteed films. The film's generation was deferred by her continuous unlucky deficiencies from the set. Monroe and her co-star Yves Montand engaged in extramarital relations, which was generally announced by the press and utilized in the film's exposure battle. "We should Make Love" was fruitless upon its discharge in September 1960; Crowther portrayed Monroe as showing up "rather messy" and "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism", and Hedda Hopper called the film "the most profane picture she's at any point done". Truman Capote campaigned for her to play Holly Golightly in a film adjustment of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", yet the job went to Audrey Hepburn as its makers expected that Monroe would confuse the generation.
