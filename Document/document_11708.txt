Throughout the fight, Jourdan's powers should participate in synchronous assaults on the left, focus and right of the Austrian line. On the French right, Souham's and Ferino's Corps met with solid obstruction and were ceased; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops accused of such power that the Austrians were pushed back. Having halted Souham's and Ferino's attack, Charles had troops accessible to counter Lefebvre's power. By then, Vandamme's men moved vigorously. Since Souham's attack at the inside had been slowed down, Charles still had enough men to turn some portion of his power to battle this new danger, yet the Austrians were hard squeezed and the activity incensed. At a certain point, Charles endeavored to lead his eight units of Hungarian grenadiers without hesitation, to the frighten of the old fighters. FÃÂ¼rstenberg apparently said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the leader of the grenadiers) and the Archduke ought not descent and battle. As FÃÂ¼rstenberg drove the Hungarian grenadiers into the fight, he was chopped somewhere near a canister and case shot utilized by the French. In spite of the fact that he was taken alive away the field, he kicked the bucket very quickly. Charles at last led his grenadiers into fight, and supposedly his own dauntlessness mobilized his troops to push back the French. After the fight, somebody evacuated FÃÂ¼rstenberg's wedding band and returned it to his better half in Prague, with updates on his passing; FÃÂ¼rstenberg was covered at the combat zone burial ground in Stockach, and his cousin raised a little landmark there, however in 1857, his body was moved to the family graveyard, "Maria Hof" at Neudingen, close Donaueschingen.
