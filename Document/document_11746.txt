"Gallaher played many dashing recreations," the British paper "The Sportsman" revealed after his demise, "and drove his side starting with one achievement then onto the next until they were regarded powerful. He was a veritable craftsman, who never merited all the hard things said about him, particularly in South Wales. An incredible player, an extraordinary judge of the diversion". Gallaher's military experience gave him a thankfulness for "control, union and unfaltering quality under strain." He was anyway tranquil, even morose, and liked to show others how its done. He demanded players go through 60 minutes "pondering the diversion ahead" on match days, and furthermore that they focus on detail. Unique All Black Ernie Booth composed of Gallaher: "To all of us Blacks his words would regularly be, 'Give nothing without end; play it safe.' As a captain he was to some degree stickler, certainly soaked up from his past military involvement in South Africa. All things considered, he treated all of us like men, not kids, who were out to 'play the amusement' for good old New Zealand." Another contemporary said he was "maybe not the best of wing-advances, in that capacity; yet he was intensely talented as a judge of men and moves".
