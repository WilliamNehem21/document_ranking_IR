"Nemegtomaia" is assessed to have been around 2ÃÂ m (7ÃÂ ft) long, and to have weighed 40ÃÂ kg (85ÃÂ lb), a size extrapolated from all the more totally known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, it would have been feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural curves had a x-formed appearance. The center three of these vertebrae were the biggest. The scapula (shoulder bone) seems to have been 185ÃÂ mm (7ÃÂ in) in all out length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (dejection) in a position like present day flying creatures, yet atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and seems to have been 152ÃÂ mm (6ÃÂ in) long. The span of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-area, and may have been 144ÃÂ mm (5ÃÂ in) long. The principal finger was moderately expansive and had a solid ungual (hook bone), and was more monstrous than the two different fingers. The second finger was marginally longer than the first, and the third finger was the littlest. The upper edge of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and however the two ilia were near one another, they were not melded. The pubic shaft was turned in reverse. The femur (thigh bone) is assessed to have been 286ÃÂ mm (11ÃÂ in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317ÃÂ mm long (12ÃÂ in).
