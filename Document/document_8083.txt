A fourth 1928 novel, "Women Almanac" by the American essayist Djuna Barnes, not just contains a character dependent on Radclyffe Hall yet incorporates entries that might be a reaction to "The Well". "Women Almanac" is a "roman ÃÂ  clef" of a lesbian abstract and imaginative hover in Paris, written in an antiquated, Rabelaisian style and featuring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his investigation agonizing over Stephen, Dame Musset's dad "pac[es] his library in the most ordinary of Night-Shirts". At the point when, not at all like Sir Phillip, he stands up to his girl, she answers unhesitatingly: "Thou, great Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay on of your ChoosingÃÂ ... Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more honorable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, but then nothing grumble?" "Women Almanac" is unmistakably more obviously sexual than "The Well"; its secretive style, loaded with in-jokes and lavish language, may have been planned to camouflage its substance from controls. It couldn't regardless be indicted by the Home Office, since it was distributed just in France, in a little, secretly printed release. It didn't turn out to be broadly accessible until 1972.
