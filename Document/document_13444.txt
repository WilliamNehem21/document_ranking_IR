Manilius habitually mimics Lucretius, who composed the instructive ballad "De rerum natura". A few classicists have recommended that Manilius may have looked to imitate Lucretius by composing six books, however proof for this theory is rare, and it remains for the most part theoretical. While Lucretius' work embraces Epicureanism (a rationality that underlines realism and wariness of superstition and celestial intercession), Manilius' work is to a great extent Stoic, and advances a Greco-Roman comprehension of creationism just as fatalistic determinism. Both Volk and the Lucretian researcher David Butterfield have contended that Manilius is from multiple points of view, an "against Lucretius", with the previous contending that "his introduction in the "Astronomica" of a deliberate universe led by destiny is an immediate assault on the irregular universe delineated by his antecedent". Manilius now and again passes on his philosophical position by means of linguistic voice: in contrast to Lucretius, who regularly utilizes an inactive development to pass on his comprehension of nature, Manilius utilizes dynamic syntactic developments to pass on the purposefulness he finds in creation (for example "God and reason, which governs all things, direct natural creatures by superb signs", "deus et proportion quae cuncta gubernat ducit abdominal muscle aeternis terrena animalia signis"). Moreover, while Lucretius utilized "De rerum natura" to introduce a non-mystical record of creation, Manilius "was a creationist as opposed to a materialistic evolutionist", and he subsequently alludes to "one soul" ("unus spiritus", 2.64), a "divine power" ("divina potentia", 3.90), a "maker" ("auctor", 3.681), and a "divine being" ("deus", 2.475) all through his lyric.
