In spite of the fact that "The Human Centipede" is set in Germany, important photography occurred in the Netherlands because of the neighboring nations' comparable scenes. Heiter's home, where the greater part of "The Human Centipede" happens, was a manor in the Netherlands found by the creation group. The property was in a local location and not encompassed by forest as it shows up in the film, however by different houses. This implied the movie producers had some trouble guaranteeing that different houses did not show up in shot. Some transformation of the property occurred before shooting, for instance, a film room was changed over to frame Heiter's storm cellar working theater, with genuine medical clinic beds and intravenous trickles leased from a nearby emergency clinic. The artistic creations of conjoined twins that were shown all through the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt added to the environment in the house. The lodging scene close to the start of the film was recorded in an inn suite at an area close Amsterdam. The film was shot as a rule in arrangement, which Yennie expressed helped the on-screen characters to build up their characters all through the film. The opening scene, which just included Laser and de Wit, was shot on the most recent day of taping.
