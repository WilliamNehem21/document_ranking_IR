In "Fan Fare", Waugh figures that his future books will be disagreeable as a result of their religious subject. On production in 1950, "Helena" was gotten detachedly by general society and by commentators, who stigmatized the ungainly blending of twentieth century student slang with generally respectful exposition. Something else, Waugh's expectation demonstrated unwarranted; all his fiction stayed in print and deals remained solid. Amid his effective 1957 claim against the "Day by day Express", Waugh's insight created figures indicating all out deals to that season of more than four million books, 66% in Britain and the rest in America. "Men at Arms", the main volume of his war set of three, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1953; beginning basic remark was tepid, with Connolly comparing "Men at Arms" to lager as opposed to champagne. Connolly changed his view later, calling the finished set of three "the best novel to leave the war". Of Waugh's other major after war works, the Knox life story was respected inside Waugh's nearby circle yet censured by others in the Church for its portrayal of Knox as a neglected casualty of the Catholic pecking order. The book did not sell wellÃ¢ÂÂ"like warm cakes", as indicated by Waugh. "Pinfold" astounded the pundits by its inventiveness. Its doubtlessly personal substance, Hastings recommends, gave the open a fixed picture of Waugh: "heavy, sulky, embarrassed and reactionary, a figure from vaudeville complete with stogie, bowler cap and boisterous checked suit."
