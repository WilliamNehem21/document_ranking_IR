"Marquee Moon" got recognition from contemporary commentators. As indicated by Tony Fletcher, the collection was hard to arrange in 1977 and was hailed as "something totally unique, another sunrise in shake music". In "NME", Kent composed that Television had turned out to be driven and sufficiently gifted to accomplish "new elements of sonic overdrive" with a "roused work of unadulterated virtuoso, a record finely in order and superbly masterminded with a totally different inclination on elements". He regarded the collection's music vivacious, modern, and inventive when shake is completely moderate. In a five-star survey for "Sounds", Vivien Goldman hailed "Marquee Moon" as "a self-evident, audacious, moment great", while Peter Gammond of "Howdy Fi News and Record Review" gave it an "A+" and called it a standout amongst the most energizing discharges in music, featured by Verlaine's steely, GÃÂ¡bor SzabÃÂ³-like guitar and credible shake music. In "Sound", Jon Tiven composed that in spite of the fact that the vocals and generation could have been more intensified, Verlaine's verses and guitar "figure out how to instinctively and mentally get the audience". Joan Downs from "Time" felt the band's sound was recognized more by the striking playing of Lloyd, who she said could turn into a noteworthy figure in shake guitar. Christgau gave "Marquee Moon" an "A+" in "The Village Voice" and trusted Verlaine's "demotic-philosophical" verses could have continued the collection alone, as would the guitar playing, which he said was as infiltrating and expressive as Eric Clapton or Jerry Garcia "yet absolutely not at all like either".
