Notwithstanding its expressive peculiarities, the "Astronomica" incorporates some inside irregularities. As per Green, the lyric is "filled with disarray and inconsistency"; he refers to its "introduction of inconsistent frameworks of visionary estimation, data over-burden, deferral of importance and opposing guidance". In the meantime, Green notes that comparative issues exist in other first-to-third-century prophetic works. As indicated by Caroline Stark, Manilius incomprehensibly asserts visionary information might be obtained by people and that it is just conceded by heavenly support. T. Barton says Manilius may have incorporated these logical inconsistencies and complexities so he would be viewed as "a figure of inaccessible information for the beginner understudy peruser". Green, while not precluding this speculation, says Manilius was presumably not persuaded by a "want to cut out for himself a place of intensity in the new magnificent universe of specialists" as Barton says. Or maybe, Green says ManiliusÃ¢ÂÂbecause of his "pride in wonderful development" and his "deferenceÃÂ ... to the Emperor"Ã¢ÂÂ looked to introduce "himself as a consistent magnificent operator, purpose on delivering an innovative beautiful venture that plots its own specific manner through the dimensions of adequate excellent talk in the early realm". David Pingree presumes that the sonnet's "vital reason appears to have been to please its crowd with verse and to stir profound respect for the artist by its astuteness".
