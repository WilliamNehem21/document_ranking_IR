Recognizing highlights can likewise be found in the ilium of the pelvis. In "Brachiosaurus", the ischiadic peduncle, a descending anticipating augmentation interfacing with the ischium, achieves more remote descending than in "Giraffatitan". While the last sort had a sharp indent between the ischiadic peduncle and the back bit of the ilium, this score is progressively adjusted in "Brachiosaurus". On the upper surface of the rear piece of the ilium, "Brachiosaurus" had an articulated tubercle that is missing in different sauropods. Of the hindlimb, the femur was fundamentally the same as that of "Giraffatitan" albeit somewhat increasingly hearty, and estimated long. As in "Giraffatitan", it was emphatically curved in cross-area, being more than twice as wide in front or back view than in side view. The fourth trochanter, a noticeable lump on the rear of the femoral shaft, was progressively conspicuous and found further descending. This lump filled in as stay point for the most critical locomotory muscle, the caudofemoralis, which was arranged in the tail and pulled the upper thigh in reverse when contracted. At the lower end of the femur, the pair of condyles did not expand in reverse as unequivocally as in "Giraffatitan"; the two condyles were comparable in width in "Brachiosaurus" yet unequal in "Giraffatitan".
