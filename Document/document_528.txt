Following his amazing drive in Monaco, and a short spell in Formula Two, Pryce was marked by Shadow as trade for Brian Redman, who had thusly supplanted Peter Revson. Pryce made his dÃÂ©but for the group in the 1974 Dutch Grand Prix. He qualified in eleventh position, under 0.4 seconds slower than his colleague, Jean-Pierre Jarier, who was in his second full period of Formula One challenge. Pryce resigned on the main lap of the race after a crash with James Hunt at the principal corner broke his Shadow DN3's back suspension. Pryce qualified third in his second Grand Prix for the group, in France, 0.32 seconds slower than Niki Lauda's post position time however about a large portion of a second faster than Jarier. By and by, Pryce's race finished at the main corner, when minor contact with Carlos Reutemann's Brabham diverted Pryce's Shadow into the way of James Hunt. The second impact between the two British drivers in the same number of races dispensed with them both. Later in the season, Pryce got 100 containers of champagne for completing quickest in the training session for the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. He proceeded to qualify on the fourth line of the beginning lattice.
