All inclusive cosmetics craftsman Jack Pierce gave uncommon consideration to the Monster's appearance in this film. He adjusted his 1931 plan to show the delayed consequences of the factory fire, including scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Through the span of shooting, Pierce altered the Monster's cosmetics to demonstrate that the Monster's wounds were recuperating as the film advanced. Penetrate co-made the Bride's cosmetics with solid contribution from Whale, particularly in regards to the Bride's notorious haircut, in view of Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire casing to accomplish the style. Lanchester detested working with Pierce, who she said "truly felt that he made these individuals, similar to he was a godÃÂ ... in the first part of the day he'd be wearing white as though he were in emergency clinic to play out a task." To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress weaved with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the performer had heard required 17 ladies 12 weeks to make. Lanchester said of her lady of the hour ensemble, "I drank as meager fluid as could reasonably be expected. It was a lot of a difficulty to go to the restroom - each one of those swathes - and being joined by my bureau."
