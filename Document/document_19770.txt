Greg Jein, best known as the builder of the alien mothership from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime "Star Trek" fan who had constructed the props for "The Final Frontier", but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from "Buck Rogers", while the frong was detailed with a prop from "Buckaroo Banzai". Elements from "The Final Frontier" were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in "The Final Frontier" became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.
