"Oryzomys" species have an expansive skull with a short platform and high braincase. The interorbital district, situated between the eyes, is tightest to the front and is flanked by all around created dots at its edges. The zygomatic plate is wide and has a very much created zygomatic score at its front. The zygomatic curve is hearty and contains a little yet unmistakable jugal bone. The interparietal bone, some portion of the top of the braincase, is thin and short; its thinness is a synapomorphy for "O.ÃÂ couesi" in addition to the swamp rice rodent as indicated by Weksler's examination. The sharp foramina are long, with their back edge at the front of the primary molars or further back. The sense of taste is additionally long, stretching out past the back edge of the maxillary bone, and is punctured close to the third molars by very much created posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid swagger, an expansion of the alisphenoid bone that in some different oryzomyines isolates two foramina in the skull. The sound-related bullae are huge. The state of the courses in the head is profoundly determined. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid procedure, a procedure at the back, is all around created and the capsular procedure, a raising of the mandibular bone lodging the foundation of the lower incisor, is obvious.
