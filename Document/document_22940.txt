Reviewers criticized or had little praise for the game's emphasis on collecting items and backtracking"an interactive egg hunt". This had become a trend in the developer's games, and "Donkey Kong 64" followed the "predictable formula" of making players collect multiple sets of items and those sets in full for a special ending. "Next Generation" also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games. "GameSpot" was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its replay value, and those who did not would be frustrated by its chores. The puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, according to "EGM", but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions. "GameSpot", however, considered parts of "Donkey Kong 64" gameplay "cerebral", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles. Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from "Super Mario 64", "Ocarina of Time", and "Banjo-Kazooie", reviewers considered the player's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher. In retrospective reviews, "Nintendo Life" described the chore of collecting objects "excessive" and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.
