The most unmistakable element was a conspicuous horn arranged on the skull midline behind the hard nostrils, which was shaped from intertwined projections of the left and right nasal bones. Just the hard horn center is known from fossilsÃ¢ÂÂin the living creature, this center would have bolstered a keratinous sheath. While the base of the horn center was smooth, its upper 66% were wrinkled and fixed with forests that would have contained veins when alive. In the holotype, the horn center is long and wide at its base, yet rapidly limits to just further up; it is in tallness. It is longer and lower in the skull of MWC 1. In the living creature, the horn would almost certainly have been progressively prolonged because of its keratinous sheath. Behind the nasal horn, the nasal bones framed an oval furrow; both this section and the nasal horn fill in as highlights to recognize "Ceratosaurus" from related genera. Notwithstanding the extensive nasal horn, "Ceratosaurus" had littler, crescent, hard edges before each eye, like those of "Allosaurus". These edges were shaped by the lacrimal bones. In adolescents, every one of the three horns were littler than in grown-ups, and the two parts of the nasal horn center were not yet intertwined.
