Gordon-Cumming was replaced in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, he stated that he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" To the first question the prince replied that he had not, although he explained that "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper courseâno other course was open to meâthan to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for "The New York Times" noticed "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands stillÂ ... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". "The Daily News" agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.
