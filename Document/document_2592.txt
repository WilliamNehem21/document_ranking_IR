Wilton acknowledged the domino hypothesis and never faltered in his pledge to Vietnam, however as right on time as mid-1967 he questioned that the war could be won except if the US was set up to go hard and fast and attack the North. Wary about extending Australia's contribution, he pushed sending a Centurion tank squadron as opposed to a third infantry contingent when calls came to expand the quality of the team in Vietnam, however at last the Federal government declared the two duties in October 1967. Wilton additionally exhorted the administration to dismiss any solicitations from the US order in Vietnam to pivot the Australian team out of Phuoc Tuy and show its capacities in a more extensive operational field, thinking that it was increasingly critical for the troops to stay in the farmland they knew and keep on structure relations with the nearby individuals. He by and by emphatically upheld the Australian team authority, Brigadier Ronald Hughes, when the last was condemned at home for directing "American style tasks" outside the quick region of Phuoc Tuy, for example, the set-piece skirmishes of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral in mid-1968. Strife kept on stewing between the Army and the RAAF with respect to air backing, and Wilton regulated dialogs among Daly and Murdoch that verified a different Army air association, prompting the arrangement of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in July 1968. On 22ÃÂ August, the Federal government declared that Wilton would be elevated to general, successful 1ÃÂ September, in acknowledgment of his "remarkable commitment to the Commonwealth in his present arrangement". He was the primary Australian officer to accomplish the position since Blamey, twenty-seven years prior.
