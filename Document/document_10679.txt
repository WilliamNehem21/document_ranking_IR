A segment of the eighteenth Tank Corps was coordinated against the eastern flank of "Totenkopf"s sixth SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment "Theodor Eicke". On the southeastern wing of the fifth Guards Tank Army, Rotmistrov conveyed the 120 tanks of the second Guards Tank Corps. Later on 12 July amid the fight, the 26th Guards Tank Brigade of that tank corps with its assessed 40 tanks were sent south to confront the III Panzer Corps. The rest of the second Guards Tank Corps, upheld by the leftovers of the second Tank Corps, was to assault "Das Reich". Their infantry support was given by the 183rd Rifle Division. The western flank of the fifth Guards Tank Army, which confronted "Totenkopf", was safeguarded by the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 42nd and 95th Guards Rifle Divisions, which were bolstered by the remainders of the 31st Tank Corps and the vigorously exhausted 23rd Guards Rifle Corps' 52nd Guards Rifle Division. The powers of the fifth Guards Mechanized Corps that were not sent south were held as hold northwest of Prokhorovka, and they numbered around 113 tanks and self-moved firearms.
