In 1962, Mills was prevailing as supervisor by Avram Davidson. At the point when Davidson left toward the finish of 1964, Joseph Ferman, who had purchased the magazine from Spivak in 1954, took over quickly as proofreader, however his child Edward before long started doing the publication work under his dad's supervision. Toward the beginning of 1966 Edward Ferman was recorded as manager, and after four years he gained the magazine from his dad and moved the publication workplaces to his home in Connecticut. Ferman remained manager for more than 25 years, and distributed some generally welcomed stories, including Fritz Leiber's "Evil Met in Lankhmar", Robert Silverberg's "Brought into the world with the Dead", and Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" arrangement. In 1991 he turned the editorship over to Kristine Kathryn Rusch, who started including more repulsiveness and dull dream than had showed up under Ferman. In the mid-1990s flow started to decay; most magazines were losing supporters and "F&SF" was no special case. Gordon Van Gelder supplanted Rusch in 1997, and purchased the magazine from Ferman in 2001, however flow kept on falling, and by 2011 it was underneath 15,000. Charles Coleman Finlay took over from Van Gelder as editorial manager in 2015.
