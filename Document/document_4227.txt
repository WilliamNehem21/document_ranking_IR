The heaviness of trains in North America had incredibly expanded by the mid-1890s. Bigger and all the more dominant trains were required to pull vehicles that took care of an expanding number of travelers and merchandise; contrasted with the trains crossing the scaffold during the 1850s, trains were the regular motors 40ÃÂ years later. The heaviness of these trains surpassed the particulars of the Suspension Bridge, and the extension organizations accepted the open door to survey and demand the substitution of the scaffold. Structural architect Leffert L. Buck, who had been enlisted to keep up the Suspension Bridge, was chosen to plan the substitution connect. He made due with an extension of the curve plan. Around then, curve spans were the new models for railroad connects and were more cost-productive than suspension spans. Buck fabricated the new extension around and underneath the Suspension Bridge, supplanting it a piece at any given moment. His arrangement permitted connect trafficÃ¢ÂÂtrain and person on footÃ¢ÂÂto proceed without interruption. By August 27, 1897, the last bits of the Suspension Bridge were disassembled, leaving the Lower Steel Arch BridgeÃ¢ÂÂlater renamed the Whirlpool Rapids BridgeÃ¢ÂÂin its stead. On investigation, the centers of the links that some time ago held up the Suspension Bridge were observed to be as stable as on the day the extension was constructed.
