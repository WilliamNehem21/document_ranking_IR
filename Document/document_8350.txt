Through WED Enterprises, a lawfully isolated substance from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney held individual responsibility for DRR and financed the formation of two trains to keep running on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of the two trains contained "Retlaw", which is "Walter" spelled in reverse. The principal train, alluded to by Disneyland workers as "Retlaw 1", would be pulled by the No. 2 train, which was given a turn-of-the-twentieth century appearance with a straight smokestack (commonplace of coal-consuming trains), a roundabout headlamp, and a little cowcatcher. The No. 2 train would pull six 1890s-style traveler autos planned by Bob Gurr, comprising of a consolidate vehicle, four mentors, and a perception mentor. The second train, alluded to by Disneyland representatives as "Retlaw 2", would be pulled by the No. 1 train, which was given a late-nineteenth century appearance with a flash capturing precious stone smokestack (run of the mill of wood-consuming trains), a rectangular headlamp, and a vast cowcatcher. The No. 1 train would pull six cargo vehicles comprising of three dairy cattle autos, two gondolas, and a rear. Walt Disney Studios constructed the train vehicles and the majority of the parts for the trains; Dixon Boiler Works fabricated the train boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works assembled the train outlines. The two trains were intended to keep running on diesel oil to create steam. Last gathering of the trains and their tenders occurred at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was worked in multi week by a development group coordinated by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a previous US Navy back chief of naval operations. The two unique DRR trains cost over $240,000 to work, with the two trains costing over $40,000 each.
