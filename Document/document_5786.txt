Steiger had expected coming back to the stage, and had marked on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's "Galileo", at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, however the creation was dropped when he turned out to be sick. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his depiction of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie "In the Heat of the Night", inverse Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police head scanning for a killer. Partial against blacks, he bounces to the end that the guilty party is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man going through town in the wake of visiting his mom, who later ends up being an accomplished crime criminologist from Philadelphia. The film manages the manner in which the two men connect and unite in unraveling the wrongdoing, as Steiger's Gillespie figures out how to significantly regard the dark man he at first took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his involvement in the Navy with a Southerner named "Lord", recalling his articulation. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the best performing artists he had ever worked with, commenting in 1995, "He's so great he made me delve into packs I never realized I had." A. D. Murphy of "Assortment" depicted Steiger's execution as "exceptional", stating: "Steiger's change from a diehard Dixie biased person to a man who figures out how to regard Poitier emerges in smooth correlation with the meandering arrangement of the homicide." Steiger won a plenty of different honors, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Laurel Award and grants for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.
