After different discourses, Minogue chose to do what she did "best" and record a straightforward pop collection roused by disco and Europop, entitled "Light Years". "Turning Around" was incorporated as the opening track of the collection and was composed by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, Kara DioGuardi and Paula Abdul, and created by Mike Spencer. Abdul had put together the tune with respect to her separation from garments fashioner Brad Beckerman and had initially planned to record it for her very own studio collection, yet it was given to Minogue after the collection neglected to emerge. The tune was the main major songwriting venture for DioGuardi, who had not been offered any outstanding tasks beforehand. In a meeting examining the improvement of "Light Years", Minogue uncovered that the melody had at first been found as a demo in New York by her A&R official Jamie Nelson, who trusted it would be "impeccable" for the artist. In the wake of tuning in to the demo, Minogue consented to record it and felt the tune could be a hit. "Turning Around" was then discharged as the lead single from the collection on 13 June 2000 in Australia, and 19 June in the United Kingdom. Minogue was captured by Liz Collins for the work of art of the record. In her 2012 style review book "Kylie/Fashion", she composed of the coordinated effort: "With 'Turning Around' the time had come to be pop-tastic once more. Liz Collins' tasteful was especially about a characteristic wonder."
