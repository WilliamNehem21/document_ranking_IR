Rindt's best outcome came the next year at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American Masten Gregory for the North American Racing Team, Rindt won the occasion. Neither one of the drivers was cheerful to race in an apparently uncompetitive vehicle. A 1998 article in "Engine Sport" expressed that neither seemed to indicate much enthusiasm for the race, yet rather it was "more an instance of 'trust it breaks soon' so they could draw their cash and split". Toward the begin, the drivers needed to hurried to their vehicles; Rindt entered with a forward roll that enabled him to get his foot on the throttle right away and take an early lead. The pair experienced extensive inconvenience in the early piece of the race; the vehicle did not restart amid Gregory's first pit stop. Afterward, the motor flopped mostly and Gregory carried the vehicle into the pits on just six of twelve barrels. Now, Rindt had effectively changed again into his non military personnel garments, anticipating that their race should be finished. Following thirty minutes of fixes, the vehicle restarted and Rindt and Gregory consented to drive the remainder of the occasion "level out", at full speed and with the going with hazard. Rindt drove the greater part of the night, progressing from eighteenth to third position before breakfast. Gregory convinced Rindt to give him a chance to drive the end some portion of the race, suspecting that his young partner probably won't drive respectably enough to nurture the vehicle to the completion. Jacky Ickx later reviewed that the two had driven "like insane people". All things being equal, the vehicle endure, giving the pair what Ickx called a "surprising triumph".
