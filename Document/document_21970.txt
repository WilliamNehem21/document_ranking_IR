The search coincided with the arrival of the Great Depression in the United States, and money for land purchase was scarce. The U.S. House of Representatives authorized the creation of the new national park on May 30, 1934, but it passed only with a rider that ensured no money would be allotted to the project for at least five years. Coe's passion and U.S. Senator Spessard Holland's politicking helped to fully establish the park, after Holland was able to negotiate of the park, leaving out Big Cypress, Key Largo, the Turner River area, and a tract of land called "The Hole in the Donut" that was too highly valued for agriculture. "Miami Herald" editor John Pennekamp was instrumental in pushing the Florida Legislature to raise $2Â million to purchase the private land inside the park boundaries. It was dedicated by President Harry Truman on December 6, 1947, one month after Marjory Stoneman Douglas' book; "The Everglades: River of Grass" was released.
