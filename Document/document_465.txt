After Buffy regurgitates on the floor, she remains in the back entryway tuning in to life continuing: kids playing, somebody rehearsing a trumpet, and winged animals singing. Long stops between discourse make holes that turn cumbersome as the characters endeavor to consider what to state, made particularly eminent in an arrangement well known for its quick chat. The change between the Christmas supper scene and the lounge room scene is unexpected, and the sound of Buffy and Joyce yelling since they dropped a pie on the floor continues into the quietness of Joyce's dead face and Buffy remaining solitary in the family room. This impact is additionally utilized when moving between Buffy's substitute form of her mom being "all around great" in the medical clinic and the paramedics endeavoring to restore her. In the vehicle while in transit to Willow's residence, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front guard, isolated from the group of onlookers by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them talk and just the sound of the vehicle can be heard.

The creepy stillness and the long, spacey delays in discussion as characters attempted to explain their emotions overstated the feeling of time prolonging stopping."
