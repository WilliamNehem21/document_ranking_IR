At the point when alarmed to the likelihood of Michael Farrar having been harmed in the months prior to the flame, investigators researched the beginning of the castor beans that had prompted police examining the September residential debate. The mark on the seed parcels distinguished them as a result of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer discovered contact data for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's location book. The criminologists reached close-by Earl May stores to discover if any representatives sold castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A representative in Missouri reviewed that in September a lady had requested ten bundles of the out-of-season seeds and clarified that she required them for schoolwork. The agent gave a depiction of the purchaser that compared to Green, and likely recognized her in a photograph line-up as the purchaser. Register tapes in the store's records demonstrated that a price tag comparing to ten bundles of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of prior such buys that would have compared to Farrar first having turned out to be sick prior in the year.
