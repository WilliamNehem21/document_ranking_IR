In July 1993, "Brisco"s two-hour pilot was screened for TV commentators in Los Angeles. Beginning basic response to the pilot was certain and centered around the silliness and the sci-fi plot focuses. "USA Today"s Matt Roush delighted in the unconventional funniness and the cast of the show, saying it chipped away at numerous dimensions and would "please everything except the family curmudgeon". Calling "Brisco" "a standout amongst the best shows of the fall season", Jennifer Stevenson of the "St. Petersburg Times" adulated the show's "clever, mocking asides". Kay Gardella wrote in the New York "Every day News" that the pilot set itself "aside from others of class" with its comical content and sight chokes. The "Los Angeles Times" called "Brisco" "satisfying drivel", and applauded Campbell and the supporting cast for providing humor without "going over the top". A few commentators, for example, Walter Goodman of "The New York Times" and David Hiltbrand of "Individuals", found the supporting characters "feebly cast" and not as solid as Campbell in the number one spot. Different commentators commended the general look of the show, for example, Todd Everett of "Assortment", who affirmed of the "solid comic-book visual style" and the pilot's high creation esteems. Writing in "The Washington Post", Tom Shales said that the pilot's creation was "more movielike than serieslike".
