In the LP and especially the CD time, the record organizations have developed a considerable inventory of FaurÃÂ©'s music, performed by French and non-French artists. A few current accounts of FaurÃÂ©'s music have come to open notice as prize-victors in yearly honors composed by "Gramophone" and the BBC. Sets of his major symphonic works have been recorded under directors including Michel Plasson (1981) and Yan Pascal Tortelier (1996). FaurÃÂ©'s fundamental chamber works have all been recorded, with players including the YsaÃÂ¿e Quartet, Domus, Paul Tortelier, Arthur Grumiaux, and Joshua Bell. The total piano works have been recorded by Kathryn Stott (1995), and Paul Crossley (1984Ã¢ÂÂ 85), with considerable arrangements of the significant piano works from Jean-Philippe Collard (1982Ã¢ÂÂ 84), Pascal RogÃÂ© (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002). FaurÃÂ©'s melodies have all been recorded for CD, including a total set (2005), moored by the accompanist Graham Johnson, with soloists Jean-Paul FouchÃÂ©court, Felicity Lott, John Mark Ainsley and Jennifer Smith, among others. The Requiem and the shorter choral works are additionally very much spoken to on circle. "PÃÂ©nÃÂ©lope" has been recorded twice, with throws headed by RÃÂ©gine Crespin in 1956, and Jessye Norman in 1981, led individually by DÃÂ©sirÃÂ©-ÃÂmile Inghelbrecht and Charles Dutoit. "PromÃÂ©thÃÂ©e" has not been recorded in full, however broad extracts were recorded under Roger Norrington (1980).
