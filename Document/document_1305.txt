The back of "Gallimimus" had 13 dorsal vertebrae, with spool-like centra that were short, yet would in general become further and longer towards the back. Their transverse procedures (forms articulating with the ribs) marginally expanded long towards the back. The two first dorsal centra had profound pneumatic foramina, while the rest just had shallow fossae (sorrows), and the neural spines were noticeable being fairly triangular or rectangular fit as a fiddle. The sacrum (combined vertebrae between the pelvic bones) comprised of five sacral vertebrae which were about equivalent long. The centra here were spool-like, smoothed sideways and had fossae which seem to have proceeded as profound foramina in certain examples. The neural spines here were rectangular, expansive, and higher than those in the dorsal vertebrae. They were higher or break even with in tallness to the upper edge of the iliac sharp edge and were isolated, while in different ornithomimids they were combined. The tail had 36Ã¢ÂÂ 39 caudal vertebrae with the centra of those at the front being spool-molded, while those at the back were almost triangular, and lengthened over. The neural spines here were high and level, yet lessened in reverse, where they progressed toward becoming edge like. The main indication of pneumaticity in the tail were profound fossae between the neural government operatives and the transverse procedure of the two first caudal vertebrae. Every one of the vertebrae before the sacrum bore ribs aside from the chart book and the last dorsal vertebra. The ribs in the neck were melded to the vertebrae just in grown-ups.
