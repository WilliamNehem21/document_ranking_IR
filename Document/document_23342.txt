The squadron began phasing out the Mirage in July 1986, and took delivery of its first Hornet on 29Â June 1987. It had come under the control of a newly re-formed No.Â 81 Wing that February. No.Â 77 Squadron's last Mirage departed Williamtown on 27Â November 1987. Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No.Â 481 Wing, which had evolved from No.Â 481 Squadron. One of No.Â 77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near Rockhampton, Queensland, on 19Â May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a defence scientist. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over Halifax Bay in Far North Queensland, when four of its Hornetsârefuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a Boeing 707 tankerâbecame the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop aerial mines. No.Â 481 Wing was reorganised as No.Â 402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its functions to No.Â 81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.
No.Â 77 Squadron operated a detachment of Pilatus PC-9 aircraft in the forward air control role from 2000 until 2003; this role was subsequently filled by the Forward Air Control Development Unit. Four Hornets from No.Â 77 Squadron were deployed to protect the US base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean between November 2001 and February 2002, during the early phase of the war in Afghanistan. In March 2006, the squadron sent a detachment of aircraft to RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, to assist with security for the Commonwealth Games being held in Melbourne. No.Â 77 Squadron deployed to the Middle East in September 2015 as part of Operation Okra, Australia's contribution of the military intervention against ISIL; it handed over to the next rotation, from No.Â 3 Squadron RAAF, in April 2016.
