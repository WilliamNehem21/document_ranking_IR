Under pressure from the Hungarian political opposition, the Hungarian government charged 14 Hungarian officers with high treason in relation to the massacres, including Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, DeÃ¡k and ZÃ¶ldi. A military trial was held in Budapest between 23 December 1943 and January 1944, and those that were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment for their part in the massacres. Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, DeÃ¡k and ZÃ¶ldi were not sentenced as they could not be located, and had fled to Germany. It is apparent from the trial proceedings that ZÃ¶ldi was present during some of the trial. Professor LajÄo Klajn has stated that those most responsible for the massacre were not tried before this military court, and that they included Prime Minister BÃ¡rdossy and the Minister for Interior Affairs Dr. Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, both of whom appeared only as witnesses. Klajn also states that the Chief of the General Staff, Ferenc Szombathelyi and the Minister of Defence should also have been examined by the court, that the "genocide had been planned by the highest military and political circles in Hungary for a long time in advance", and had been intended to convince the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop that Hungarian troops were needed on its territory instead of the Eastern Front. In mid-1944, Partisan activity increased in BaÄka to such an extent that special regulations similar to the "Special Administrative Regulations" that applied to the operational zones of the Hungarian Army were extended to BaÄka: curfews were imposed and political activities were forbidden. A self-defence organization, the Pandurs, was created.
