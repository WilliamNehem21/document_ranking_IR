Griffiths looked for a verifiable source for the HorusÃ¢ÂÂ Set contention, and he set two unmistakable predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus admirers, like Sethe's hypothesis, to represent it. However the issue stays uncertain, halfway in light of the fact that other political relationship for Horus and Set confound the image further. Before even Upper Egypt had a solitary ruler, two of its real urban areas were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, numerous miles toward the north. The leaders of Nekhen, where Horus was the benefactor divinity, are for the most part accepted to have bound together Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their influence. Set was related with Naqada, so it is conceivable that the perfect clash faintly mirrors an ill will between the urban communities in the removed past. A lot later, toward the second's end Dynasty (c. 2890Ã¢ÂÂ 2686 BCE), King Peribsen utilized the Set creature recorded as a hard copy his "serekh"- name, instead of the conventional hawk symbolic representation speaking to Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy utilized both Horus and Set in the composition of his "serekh". This proof has incited guess that the Second Dynasty saw a conflict between the supporters of the Horus-ruler and the admirers of Set driven by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's utilization of the two creature images would then speak to the compromise of the two groups, as does the goals of the legend.
