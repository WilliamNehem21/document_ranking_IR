I-75 crosses the Pine River before entering Chippewa County. The turnpike accepts an all the more northerly track as it goes under M-48 without a trade. More distant north, M-48 bends around to interface I-75 with Rudyard, and the road swings back to proceed with northeastward. About upper east of Rudyard, I-75 goes by Chippewa County International Airport, the previous Kincheloe Air Force Base in Kinross and Kincheloe. North of there in Dafter, the turnpike converges M-28 (9ÃÂ Mile Road). Past that exchange, I-75 grabs the Lake Superior Circle Tour (LSCT) assignment, which it conveys the remainder of the way north. On the south side of Sault Ste. Marie, the turnpike meets BS I-75 and grabs the LHCT assignment once again. I-75 rounds the west side of the city, passes the Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport and the grounds of Lake Superior State University before meeting the traditions and toll squares for the International Bridge. From that point, I-75 crosses the two-path connect and ends at the Canadian outskirt. , the toll rates on the extension are $3 for traveler vehicles, $2.10 for suburbanites, and $4 per pivot for business vehicles; right now a similar toll rate is evaluated in US dollars and Canadian dollars. Drivers have the alternative to pay with money or an IQ Card, an electronic toll gathering platinum card that utilizes radio-recurrence recognizable proof innovation.
