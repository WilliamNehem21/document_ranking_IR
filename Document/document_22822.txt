In Sarah Polley's romance "Take This Waltz" (2011), co-starring Seth Rogen and Luke Kirby, Williams played a married writer attracted to her neighbor. Though the actress considered it to be a light-hearted film, Jenny McCartney of "The Daily Telegraph" found a darker undertone to it and favorably compared its theme to that of "Blue Valentine". To play a part that would appeal to her daughter, Williams starred as Glinda the Good Witch in Sam Raimi's fantasy picture "Oz the Great and Powerful" (2013). Based on the "Oz" children's books, it served as a prequel to the 1939 classic film "The Wizard of Oz". It marked her first appearance in a film involving special effects and she credited Raimi for making her comfortable with the process. The film earned over $490million worldwide to emerge as one of her highest-grossing releases. "Suite FranÃ§aise", a period drama that Williams filmed in 2013, was released in a few territories in 2015 but was not theatrically distributed in America. She later admitted to being displeased with how the film turned out, adding that she found it hard to predict the quality of a project during production. Eager to work in a different medium and finding it tough to obtain film roles that enabled her to maintain her parental commitments, Williams spent the next few years working on stage.
