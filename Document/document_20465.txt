In issuing desired specifications for the design that would become the "Nevada"-class, the Navy's General Board asked for triple gun turrets, "i.e.", three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the "Nevada"s, which had five and six two-gun turretsâyet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the "South Carolina"s, it was not even in the experimental stageâthe first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision to go ahead with the turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success; the only issue came with shell interference when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by delaying the firing of the center barrel by a small fraction of a second. Moreover, there was a major benefit in weight thanks to the accompanying loss of an armored barbette and turret. These weight savings were applied to the armor protection, making the "all or nothing" concept a reality.
