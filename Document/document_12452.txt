Hesitant to confront the Patriarch's fierceness, Paul yet again chose to escape, and attempt his karma in Rome. As Nicol brings up, such a move would be exceedingly surprising for an Orthodox cleric, yet might be clarified by his family's connections with professional Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital: George Tagaris, his putative sibling or father, was among the individuals who bolstered the Union of the Churches and had gotten letters of consolation from Pope Innocent VI. To abstain from going close Constantinople, Paul was compelled to make an expansive bypass. He took a ship, most likely from Trebizond, to the Crimea, where he introduced the neighborhood legislative head of the Golden Horde with gems from the fortune he had amassed. In return, he got an escort through the Horde lands (present day Ukraine) to the Kingdom of Hungary, and thereupon to Rome. There he verified a group of people with Pope Urban VI, professing to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Paul introduced himself to the Pope as a contrite, offered an admission, and grasped the Catholic confidence. Inspired by Paul's unassuming manner, the Pope named him (in late 1379 or mid 1380) to the main post of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, which had been empty since September 1378, when its officeholder, Giacomo da Itri, had announced his faithfulness to the Avignon hostile to pope Clement VII. Urban likewise named Paul missional legate for all nations "east of Durazzo".
