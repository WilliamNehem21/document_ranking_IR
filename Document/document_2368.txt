"Relentless", joined by the battlecruiser and under the order of Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne, experienced the German battlecruiser "Goeben" and the light cruiser "Breslau" on the morning of 4 August 1914, which were traveled east after a careless siege of the French Algerian port of Philippeville. England and Germany were not yet at war, so Milne swung to shadow the Germans as they made a beeline for Messina to re-coal. Each of the three battlecruisers had issues with their boilers, yet "Goeben" and "Breslau" had the capacity to break contact and achieved Messina by the morning of the fifth. At this point Germany had attacked Belgium and war had been announced, however an Admiralty request to regard Italian nonpartisanship and remain in excess of six miles (10ÃÂ km) from the Italian coast blocked entering the Strait of Messina, from which they could have watched the port legitimately. In this way, Milne positioned and "Inexhaustible" at the northern exit of the strait, anticipating that the Germans should break out toward the west where they could assault French troop transports. He positioned the light cruiser at the southern exit, and sent "Dauntless" to coal at Bizerte, where she was good to go in the Western Mediterranean.
