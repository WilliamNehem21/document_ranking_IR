The physicists at Aldermaston had a lot of thoughts regarding how to catch up Grapple X. Conceivable outcomes were examined in September 1957. One was to tinker with the width of the shells in the Dick to locate an ideal arrangement. On the off chance that they were excessively thick, they would moderate the neutrons created by the combination response; on the off chance that they were excessively flimsy, they would offer ascent to Taylor shakiness. Another was to get rid of the shells altogether and utilize a blend of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had a thought, which Sam Curran upheld, of a three-layer Dick that utilized lithium deuteride that was less advanced in lithium-6 (and in this manner had more lithium-7), yet a greater amount of it, lessening the measure of uranium-235 in the focal point of the center. This proposition was the one received in October, and it wound up known as "Dickens" since it utilized Ken's Dick. The gadget would some way or another be like Round A, however with a bigger radiation case. As far as possible was again set to . Keith Roberts determined that the yield could reach , and proposed this could be decreased by adjusting the alter, however Cook restricted this, expecting it may make the test come up short. In light of the likelihood of a ban on testing, plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, were limited to the Prime Minister, who gave verbal endorsement, and a bunch of authorities.
