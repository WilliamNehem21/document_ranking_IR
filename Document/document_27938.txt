North of Ellendale, USÂ 113 enters the Delaware Bay watershed; the highway crosses Cedar Creek and passes to the west of the unincorporated village of Lincoln. The highway continues through the city of Milford, which was founded in the early 19thÂ century at the head of navigation of the Mispillion River whose antebellum buildings, late 19th-century buildings, and shipbuilding heritage are preserved, respectively, in the North Milford, South Milford and Milford Shipyard Area historic districts. US 113 intersects DEÂ 36 (Lakeview Avenue) on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments, Silver Lake to the east and Haven Lake to the west. The highway has a grade crossing of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision track and intersects DEÂ 14 (Front Street/Milford Harrington Highway). On the north side of Milford, US 113 passes the historic Walnut Farm and heads east of a park and pool lot at a local business before it intersects DEÂ 1Â Business (Walnut Street) obliquely. DEÂ 1Â Business joins USÂ 113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern termini at a partial interchange with DEÂ 1. There is no direct access from northbound USÂ 113 to southbound DEÂ 1 or from northbound DEÂ 1 to southbound USÂ 113.
