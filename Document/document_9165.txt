From the most punctual occasions, the Chinese were worried about the damaging power of seismic tremors. It was recorded in Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian" of 91ÃÂ BC that in 780ÃÂ BC a seismic tremor had been sufficiently amazing to occupy the courses of three streams. It was not known at the time that seismic tremors were brought about by the moving of structural plates in the Earth's outside layer; rather, the general population of the old Zhou Dynasty clarified them as unsettling influences with enormous yin and yang, alongside the sky's disappointment with acts submitted (or the average folks' complaints disregarded) by the present decision administration. These hypotheses were at last gotten from the old content of the "Yijing" (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early hypotheses about quakes, created by those, for example, the old Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.ÃÂ 500Ã¢ÂÂ 428ÃÂ BC) trusted that they were brought about by overabundance water close to the surface outside layer of the earth blasting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460Ã¢ÂÂ 370ÃÂ BC) trusted that the immersion of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.ÃÂ 585Ã¢ÂÂ c.ÃÂ 525ÃÂ BC) trusted they were the aftereffect of huge bits of the Earth falling into the huge hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384Ã¢ÂÂ 322ÃÂ BC) trusted they were brought about by unsteadiness of vapor ("pneuma") brought about by the drying of the damp Earth by the Sun's beams.
