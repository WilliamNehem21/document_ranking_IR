"Tetra Master" is a card-based minigame that can be started with different non-playable characters in the field. Players amass a deck of five cards, which can be gotten by means of chests, given as a reward, or earned from battling beasts. Each card has different bolts which point to the four sides and four corners of the card, and different details that change between cards, with rarer cards being all the more dominant. Players take it in swings to deliberately put cards on a 4x4 playing lattice dependent on the accessible bearings. Fights can happen when players place a card alongside another card, contingent upon where the player places it. In the event that the guarding card has no bolts while the assaulting card has a bolt pointing towards it, that card is set under the player's control. At the point when two bolts meet with one another, the cards do fight dependent on their point esteems, with the losing card going under the triumphant player's control, some of the time activating combos that put different cards in the champ's control. After all cards are played, the champ is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw happening in the event that they have a similar number of cards. The triumphant player may pick a card from their rival's deck out of the ones they put under their control. On the off chance that the triumphant player scores an ideal win in any case, in which each of the ten cards are put under their control, they will win every one of the five cards from the adversary's deck.
