Right off the bat in 1882 Nansen took "...the first lethal advance that drove me off track from the peaceful existence of science." Professor Robert Collett of the college's zoology office recommended that Nansen take an ocean voyage, to examine Arctic zoology at direct. Nansen was energetic, and made courses of action through an ongoing associate, Captain Axel Krefting, leader of the sealer "Viking". The voyage started on 11 March 1882 and reached out over the accompanying five months. In the prior weeks fixing began, Nansen had the capacity to focus on logical investigations. From water tests he demonstrated that, in opposition to past suspicion, ocean ice frames on the outside of the water as opposed to beneath. His readings additionally exhibited that the Gulf Stream streams underneath a virus layer of surface water. Through the spring and late-spring "Viking" wandered among Greenland and Spitsbergen looking for seal groups. Nansen turned into a specialist marksman, and on one day gladly recorded that his group had shot 200 seal. In July, "Viking" ended up caught in the ice near an unexplored segment of the Greenland coast; Nansen yearned to go shorewards, however this was unimaginable. In any case, he started to build up the possibility that the Greenland icecap may be investigated, or even crossed. On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and right off the bat in August was back in Norwegian waters.
