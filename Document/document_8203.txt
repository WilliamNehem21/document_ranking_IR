The plumage of antbirds is delicate and not brilliantly shaded, in spite of the fact that it is once in a while striking. The shading palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and darker. Plumages can be uniform in shading or designed with notwithstanding or spots. Sexual dimorphism Ã¢ÂÂ contrasts in plumage shading and example among guys and females Ã¢ÂÂ is regular in the family. By and large the example inside the family is for the guys to have mixes of dark, dark or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and darker hues. For instance, the male spot winged antwren is principally blackish, while the female has rust-hued underparts. In certain genera, for example, "Myrmotherula", species are preferable recognized by female plumage over by male. Numerous types of antbirds have a differentiating 'fix' of white (once in a while different hues) plumes on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is normally hidden by the darker plumes on the back however when the winged animal is energized or frightened these quills can be raised to streak the white fix. dab winged antwrens puff out white back patches, while in pale blue slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white fix is on the shoulder.
