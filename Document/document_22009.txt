In July 1972 Peter Cormack signed from Nottingham Forest equaling the record Â£110,000 fee Liverpool paid for John Toshack. Shankly described Cormack's signature as, 'The final piece in the jigsaw' of that team. In the 1972â73 season they duly won the League and the club's first European trophy, the UEFA Cup. Cormack and Keegan scored in a 2-0 Easter Monday showdown with title rivals, Don Revie's Leeds United. Fellow title contenders Arsenal only drew at Southampton the same day. Liverpool needing a final game draw for the title drew 0-0 at home versus Leicester City. Their eighth League title equalled the record held by Arsenal and was their first captained by a non-Scot, Tommy Smith. A 1973 UEFA Cup Final downpour meant the home first leg was abandoned after 27 minutes. Shankly in those 27 minutes felt the Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach defence was suspect in the air. Shankly started tall forward, John Toshack, in the re-arranged game demoting the small build of Brian Hall to a substitute appearance in a 3-0 win. Toshack headed assists for two Keegan strikes with Lloyd also heading a goal. A 2â0 second leg, away loss meant Liverpool won 3â2 on aggregate. They were the first English team to win the League and a UEFA competition in the same season.
