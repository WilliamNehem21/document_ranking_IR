Willkie's condition just exacerbated as the weeks went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, however on the outing he was hit with another heart assault. In spite of the fact that his counselors instructed him to look for treatment and desert the excursion, Willkie went ahead. When he touched base in New York, Willkie was in incredible torment and his press secretary called a rescue vehicle to take him to Lenox Hill Hospital. He recouped to some degree, enough so his companions anticipated that him should be released. He invested energy chipping away at the galleys of his second book, "An American Program", and arranged future activities. On October 4, Willkie got a throat contamination, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recouping, Willkie's presently endless heart assaults struck again and he endured three additional assaults on October 7. The emergency clinic, which had been issuing consoling releases to the general population, was presently compelled to illuminate the open that Willkie's condition had compounded and that he was fundamentally sick. The following morning, Willkie endured one final assault which demonstrated lethal. From the time he registered with Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have endured over twelve heart assaults.
