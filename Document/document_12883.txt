In 1925, Fender came back to his best frame, finishing the twofold with 1,042 runs and 137 wickets. Surrey completed second in the table and before the finish of the period had not lost a Championship coordinate at the Oval for a long time. Be that as it may, they never tested the victors, Yorkshire, and this turned out to be the last time under Fender's authority that the group completed close to the highest point of the Championship table. In the perspective on the press, Fender remained a potential England skipper for the Ashes arrangement in 1926, yet Arthur Carr was picked. In his review of England cricket skippers, Alan Gibson recommends that Fender and Carr were the main two practical hopefuls at that pointÃ¢ÂÂother area commanders either came up short on the ability to play Tests or had just been attempted and disposed of. At the point when Carr was dropped before the last Test, the writer Home Gordon announced that a "specific novice"Ã¢ÂÂ Gibson proposes this more likely than not been FenderÃ¢ÂÂwas hanging tight by the telephone for news that he was to chief England. In the occasion, Percy Chapman took over for the last match and England recaptured the Ashes. In any case, Streeton trusts that by this stage, Fender was never prone to be picked; he played in a Test preliminary match and for the Gentlemen against the Players, yet Greville Stevens was favored in the England group. In all top of the line matches, Fender finished the twofold again with 1,043 runs and 112 wickets. After the season, he joined a short voyage through Jamaica driven by Lord Tennyson, playing three top notch matches.
