On 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-assigned the High Seas Fleet. From the finish of May to early June, the armada went on its late spring voyage in the North Sea, coming back to the Baltic by means of the Kattegat. This was trailed by the normal voyage to Norway from 12 July to 10 August.

The winter preparing voyage went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the armada went on a noteworthy journey into the Atlantic rather than its typical voyage in the North Sea. Stops included Horta, in the Azores. The armada came back to Kiel on 13 August to get ready for the fall moves enduring from 27 August to 7 September. Division practices in the Baltic pursued from 7 to 13 September. In mid 1909, "Wettin" was smashed by the war vessel . She was not harmed in the mishap and had the capacity to keep preparing that year. Amid the yearly moves, "Wettin" won the Kaiser's "SchieÃÂpreis" (Shooting Prize) for the best exactness with her principle battery among I Squadron ships. The year 1910 passed uneventfully for "Wettin" with a comparative everyday practice of preparing, activities, and travels as in earlier years.
