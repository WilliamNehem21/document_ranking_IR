Herrick's chateau, Greyfriars House, stayed in the ownership of his family until his incredible grandson Samuel sold it in 1711. The property was in this manner separated and sold in 1740; after three years, New Street was worked over the western piece of the site. Numerous entombments were found when houses were spread out along the road. A townhouse, 17 Friar Lane, was based on the eastern piece of the site in 1759 and endures today. Amid the nineteenth century, the site turned out to be progressively based on. In 1863 Alderman Newton's Boys' School assembled a school building on part of the site. Herrick's manor was wrecked in 1871, the present Gray Friars Street was laid through the site in 1873, and increasingly business improvements, including the Leicester Trustee Savings Bank, were fabricated. In 1915 the remainder of the site was procured by Leicestershire County Council which manufactured workplaces on it during the 1930s. The district gathering migrated in 1965 when its new County Hall opened, and Leicester City Council moved in. The remainder of the site, where Herrick's patio nursery had once been, was moved toward a staff vehicle leave in around 1944, yet was not generally based on.
