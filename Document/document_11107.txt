The debut flying course initiated in January 1923. Essential guidance occurred on the Avro 504Ks, and further developed or concentrated preparing on the school's other airplane. Fourteen understudies initiated the year-long course, and twelve graduated. Just as flying, they examined aviation, interchanges, route, combat hardware and general military subjects. Squadron Leader Anderson continued order of No.ÃÂ 1 FTS in 1925; the next year he gave over to Wing Commander Adrian Cole, who drove the unit until 1929. The main Citizen Air Force (dynamic save) pilots' course kept running from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 understudies finishing the preparation. In spite of the fact that 24 mishaps happened, there were no fatalities, driving Cole to comment at the graduation service that the understudies were either made of India elastic or had figured out how to crash "modestly securely". In any case, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was damaged by three deadly mishaps. The next year, 29 understudies graduatedÃ¢ÂÂthirteen PAF, nine hold, and seven bound for trade with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were supplanted by deÃÂ Havilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths; these were increased by Gipsy Moths initiating in 1930.
