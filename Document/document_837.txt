Bits of gossip that Isabeau and OrlÃÂ©ans were darlings started to circle, a relationship that was viewed as forbidden. Regardless of whether the two were cozy has been addressed by contemporary students of history, including Gibbons who trusts the talk may have been planted as publicity against Isabeau as striking back against assessment expands she and OrlÃÂ©ans requested in 1405. An Augustinian minister, Jacques Legrand, lectured a long message to the court censuring abundance and evil, specifically referencing Isabeau and her designsÃ¢ÂÂwith uncovered necks, shoulders and dÃÂ©colletage. The priest introduced his lesson as moral story so as not to annoy Isabeau obviously, however he cast her and her women in-holding up as "irate, vindictive characters". He said to Isabeau, "On the off chance that you don't trust me, go out into the city camouflaged as a poor lady, and you will hear what everybody is stating." Thus he blamed Isabeau as having put some distance between the ordinary people and the court with its subjects. At about a similar time a sarcastic political flyer, "Songe Veritable", presently considered by students of history to be genius Burgundian purposeful publicity, was discharged and generally circulated in Paris. The handout indicated the Queen's relations with OrlÃÂ©ans.
