In 1914 KetÃÂ¨lbey composed the symphonic work "In a Monastery Garden", which was distributed in the next year both as a piano piece and in full instrumental structure. It was his first significant achievement, his most celebrated piece, and ended up known everywhere throughout the world; by 1920 over a million duplicates of the sheet music had been sold. There are two contending stories specifying the motivation behind the piece: in spite of the fact that KetÃÂ¨lbey later said that he composed the work for an old companion, he likewise expressed that he created it in the wake of visiting a religious community. The musicologist Peter Dempsey thinks about that "this pieceÃÂ ... stays right up 'til the present time a widely acclaimed staple of the light-music collection, while McCanna opines that from the principal bar, audience members "...ÃÂ might sooner expect such a gadget in the enthusiastic universe of a [Gustav] Mahler ensemble than in a cultured English salon piece". The accomplishment of "The Phantom Melody" and "In a Monastery Garden" prompted KetÃÂ¨lbey's commitment by AndrÃÂ© Charlot as the melodic executive for the 1916 revue "Tests!" at the Vaudeville Theater. The arrangement prompted comparable positions at other London theaters, including the Adelphi, Garrick, Shaftesbury and Drury Lane theaters.
