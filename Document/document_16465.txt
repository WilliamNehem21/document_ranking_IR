The painting was Etty's largest work to that time, measuring 442.5Â cm by 297Â cm (14Â ft 6Â in by 9Â ft 9Â in). The work was completed in 1837 and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts later that year, and hung in the Academy's new building at Trafalgar Square (now the National Gallery). The work, and Etty's methods in making it, divided opinion: "The Gentleman's Magazine" considered it "by far the finest [painting] that Mr. Etty has ever paintedÂ ... it is a historical work of the first class, and abounds with beauties of all kinds", while "The Spectator" described it as "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridityâglowing in colour and wonderful in execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".
Possibly because of its size, "The Sirens and Ulysses" failed to sell at the 1837 Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 wealthy Manchester cotton merchant Daniel Grant, an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned "Venus and her Doves" from him, met Etty at Heaton Park races and offered to buy "The Sirens and Ulysses" and Etty's smaller "Samson Betrayed by Delilah" unseen for a total of Â£200. Etty was hoping for Â£400 for the two paintings, but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost Â£100,000 that year offered a price of Â£300 for the pair. Grant counter-offered Â£250 (about Â£ in today's terms), which Etty refused. On leaving at the end of the evening, Grant suddenly said, "Will you take the money?", startling Etty, who in his surprise agreed. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving the painting to his brother William, who in turn gave it to the Royal Manchester Institution in 1839.
