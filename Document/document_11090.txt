In their unique portrayal, Charig and Milner discovered "Baryonyx" one of a kind enough to warrant another group of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They discovered "Baryonyx" to be not normal for some other theropod gathering, and thought about how conceivable it is that it was a thecodont (a gathering of early archosaurs currently viewed as unnatural), because of having obviously crude highlights, yet noticed that the verbalization of the maxilla and premaxilla was like that in "Dilophosaurus". They additionally noticed that the two noses from Niger (which later turned into the premise of "Cristatusaurus"), appointed to the family Spinosauridae by Taquet in 1984, showed up practically indistinguishable to that of "Baryonyx" and they alluded them to Baryonychidae. In 1988, the American scientist Gregory S. Paul concurred with Taquet that "Spinosaurus", depicted in 1915 dependent on fragmentary stays from Egypt that were obliterated in World War II, and "Baryonyx" were comparative and (because of their crimped noses) conceivably late-enduring dilophosaurs. Buffetaut additionally bolstered this relationship in 1989. In 1990, Charig and Milner rejected the spinosaurid affinities of "Baryonyx", since they didn't discover their remaining parts sufficiently comparable. In 1997, they concurred that Baryonychidae and Spinosauridae were connected, however differ that the previous name ought to turn into an equivalent word of the last mentioned, on the grounds that the culmination of "Baryonyx" contrasted with "Spinosaurus" made it a superior sort variety for a family, and in light of the fact that they didn't discover the similitudes between the two sufficiently critical. Holtz and associates recorded Baryonychidae as an equivalent word of Spinosauridae in 2004.
