[E] "The Peterborough Chronicle": In 1116, a flame at the religious community at Peterborough demolished the vast majority of the structures. The duplicate of the "Account" kept there may have been lost around then or later, however in either case presently a crisp duplicate was made, evidently replicated from a Kentish adaptationÃ¢ÂÂwell on the way to have been from Canterbury. The original copy was composed at one time and by a solitary recorder, down to the archive for 1121. The recorder added material identifying with Peterborough Abbey which isn't in different renditions. The Canterbury unique which he replicated was comparable, yet not indistinguishable, to [D]: the Mercian Register does not show up, and a sonnet about the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, which shows up in a large portion of the other enduring duplicates of the Chronicle, isn't recorded. A similar recorder then proceeded with the chronicles through to 1131; these sections were made at interims, and in this manner are apparently contemporary records. At long last, a second copyist, in 1154, composed a record of the years 1132Ã¢ÂÂ 1154; however his dating is known to be temperamental. This last passage is in Middle English, as opposed to Old English. [E] was once possessed by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury 1633Ã¢ÂÂ 1654, so is otherwise called the "Commend Chronicle". The composition contains intermittent gleams in Latin, and is alluded to (as "the Saxon storye of Peterborowe church") in a collector book from 1566. As indicated by Joscelyn, Nowell had a transcript of the original copy. Past proprietors incorporate William Camden and William L'Isle; the last most likely passed the original copy on to Laud.
