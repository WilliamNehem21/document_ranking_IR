Under mounting political weight, John at long last arranged terms for a compromise, and the ecclesiastical terms for accommodation were acknowledged within the sight of the ecclesiastical legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As a major aspect of the arrangement, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a medieval administration of 1,000 imprints (proportionate to ÃÂ£666 at the time) every year: 700 imprints (ÃÂ£466) for England and 300 imprints (ÃÂ£200) for Ireland, just as rewarding the congregation for income lost amid the emergency. The understanding was formalized in the "Bulla Aurea", or Golden Bull. This goals created blended reactions. Albeit a few recorders felt that John had been mortified by the succession of occasions, there was minimal open response. Blameless profited by the goals of his long-standing English issue, yet John likely increased more, as Innocent turned into a firm supporter of John for the remainder of his rule, backing him in both local and mainland arrangement issues. Honest promptly betrayed Philip, calling upon him to dismiss plans to attack England and to sue for harmony. John paid a portion of the pay cash he had guaranteed the congregation, however he stopped making installments in late 1214, leaving 66% of the total unpaid; Innocent seems to have helpfully overlooked this obligation for the benefit of the more extensive relationship.
