Khan performed close by Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening service of the IPL 2011 season, where they moved to Tamil melodies. He showed up again in 2013 close by Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull. In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) restricted him from the Wankhede Stadium for a long time for getting into a contention with the security staff after a match among KKR and the Mumbai Indians. Khan had, notwithstanding, expressed that he acted simply after youngsters, including his little girl, were being "mistreated" by the security staff and that the authorities were amazingly overbearing and forceful in their conduct, he had been mishandled with common revolting remark. Later MCA authorities had blamed him for being flushed in one form of the story, hitting the gatekeeper and of totally strangely mishandling a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another adaptation of the story, which Khan had kept up it was done to help their activity and for modest exposure. Wankhede monitor later negated MCA authorities' case and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him. Khan later apologized to his fans after his group won the last match. MCA disavowed the boycott in 2015 and in 2016, Mumbai Police educated that no 'cognisable offense' was made out against Khan and they had arrived at the resolution that Shah Rukh Khan was not flushed and did not utilize damaging language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.
