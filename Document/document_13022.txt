"Bizarre Tales" was at this point entrenched, however in 1931 Clayton at long last gave it some immediate challenge with "Unusual Tales", which was likewise altered by Bates. Like its rival, "Unusual Tales" every now and again distributed sci-fi just as dream; similarly as with "Amazing" it paid preferred rates over the challenge, and accordingly pulled in some great authors, including Jack Williamson, whose "Wolves of Darkness", around an intrusion by creatures from another measurement, is one of its better-recalled stories. "Bizarre Tales" did not keep going long: by late 1932, Clayton was in budgetary challenges, and "Shocking" changed to an every other month plan. Effectively every other month, "Unusual Tales" additionally decreased its distribution recurrence. The main part of Clayton's obligations were owed to his printer, which Clayton endeavored to gain to avert it purchasing out his distributing house, yet this demonstrated an appalling move. He needed assets to finish the exchange, and was compelled to opt for non-payment. The January 1933 issue of the two magazines was proposed to be the last, however enough stories stayed in stock to deliver one more issue of "Surprising", which showed up in March 1933. Road and Smith gained "Surprising" and "Bizarre Tales" from the clearance of Clayton's benefits, and relaunched "Dumbfounding" in October that year. "Unusual Tales" did not return; Street and Smith chose to run the tales in "Bizarre Tales"' stock in "Bewildering."
