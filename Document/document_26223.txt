Regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the soundtrack for "Final Fantasy VIII". He tried to base the songs on the emotional content of the scenes in which they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desired was more important than improving skills: "I think it will be a shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attireâ"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" When IGN Music stated that the music of "Final Fantasy VIII" was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu said "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of "Final Fantasy VI" and "Final Fantasy VII" ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a "highlight" in the game, but he found "Final Fantasy VIII" only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the "Eyes on Me" theme.
