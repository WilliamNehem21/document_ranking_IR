Outside shots of the Luthor Mansion were shot at the Hatley Castle in Victoria, two hours west of Vancouver by ship. Time limitations constrained scenes, which were shot from various points, to in some cases be shot at independent areas. A scene including Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her patio was shot at two unique areas. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football arena, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato-preparing industrial facility. Unfit to shoot at the house being utilized as the Lang living arrangement, the team manufactured Lana's entryway patio inside a sewage handling office for the last scene of the scene where Lana strolls up the stairs to her home. The nearby sewage treatment office is additionally the site for the LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to oversee. The accident site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where "Mission to Mars" was recorded. Smallville's Main Street was recorded in both the town of Merritt, which is three hours east of Vancouver, and in the town of Cloverdale. The vast majority of the taping occurred in Cloverdale, since the town had a significant lot of empty structures that could serve as Smallville's Main Street. At the point when the generation group came to film the opening mystery, they needed to embellish the town with strips and inflatables, just as paint a portion of the structures to achieve Millar's concept of "Smalltown, USA". Two sets were constructed only for the pilot. The Kent storm basement was worked as a spread set inside the ranch's stable. For the graveyard scene among Clark and Lana, generation originator Bernard Hides assembled the whole burial ground sans preparation in an unfilled field.
