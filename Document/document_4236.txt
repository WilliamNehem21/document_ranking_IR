Feustking's lyrics was composed altogether in German, its likely sources being the old accounts of Tacitus and Suetonius. The content has been generally condemned for its low quality; Friedrich Chrysander composed of it: "There is no soul in the refrain, and one feels vexation in setting such stuff to music". A later commentator, Paul Henry Lang, refers to the "hopeless quality" of the lyrics as the vital explanation behind the musical show's disappointment. Senior member and Knapp propose that the principle blame is that Feustking lethally over-muddles the fundamental story by fusing sub-plots, superfluous additional characters, and "each stock gadget known to the operatic repertory". These interruptions incorporate masks, mixed up characters, a much-criticized thinker, a comic hireling and a play inside the play. A significant number of the characters are chronicled, including Nero, Octavia, Poppea, Nero's mom Agrippina, and Seneca the rationalist. A few of these show up in Handel's later (1709) musical drama "Agrippina". Another genuine figure who shows up in "Nero" is Anicetus, who verifiably is held to have killed Agrippina for Nero's sake. Depicted in the lyrics as "des Kaysers Mignon oder Liebling" ("The ruler's little one, or sweetheart"), Anicetus is Handel's solitary transparently gay operatic character.
