With the Coinage Act of 1965, the Mint changed to striking clad coins, produced using a sandwich of copper nickel around a center of unadulterated copper. There are no mint blemishes on coins dated from 1965 to 1967, as the Mint endeavored endeavors to dishearten the storing that it accused for the coin deficiencies that had gone before the 1965 demonstration. The Mint altered the ace center point just somewhat when it started clad coinage, yet beginning in 1981, rolled out minor improvements that brought down the coin's help significantly, prompting a compliment look to Roosevelt's profile. This was done as such that coinage kicks the bucket would last more. Mint imprints continued in 1968 at Denver and for evidence coins at San Francisco. In spite of the fact that the California office starting in 1965 every so often struck dimes for trade, those drag no mint checks and are vague from ones printed at Philadelphia. The main dimes to hold up under the "S" mint imprint for San Francisco since 1968 have been verification coins, continuing an arrangement begat from 1946 to 1964 without mint imprint at Philadelphia. Since 1992, silver dimes with the pre-1965 sythesis have been struck at San Francisco for consideration in yearly verification sets highlighting silver coins.
