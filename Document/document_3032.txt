Diane Hamer compares Bannon's work to the Mills and Boon of lesbian writing, yet not at all like regular romance books, her accounts never truly have slick and clean ends. Hamer additionally observes Bannon's utilization of Freudian imagery: in "I Am a Woman", Jack often specifies that he is being psychoanalyzed, and his companions respond with intrigue. Jack marks Laura "Mother" and keeps on alluding to this epithet rather than her genuine name all through the arrangement, just as BannonÃ¢ÂÂthrough JackÃ¢ÂÂis enigmatically deriding Freud and the thoughts that have encircled the development of sexuality during the 1950s. Researcher Michele Barale comments that Bannon's scholarly gadgets in "Beebo Brinker" resist the desires for the crowd for whom the novel was explicitly advertised: hetero guys. Bannon picks the principal character, an "everyman" namedÃ¢ÂÂfundamentallyÃ¢ÂÂJack Mann, with whom the male crowd distinguishes, just to unveil that he is gay and has maternal senses. His advantage swings to Beebo, whom he discovers "attractive" and lost, and he takes her home, gets her alcoholic, and turns out to be abiogenetically private with her. Barale composes that Bannon controls male perusers to end up inspired by the story, at that point transforms them into voyeurs and forces gay wants upon them, however in the end puts them in a protected position to comprehend a gay story from a hetero perspective.
