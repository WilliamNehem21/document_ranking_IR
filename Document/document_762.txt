In November 1943, Hannah was selected leader of No.ÃÂ 6 Squadron at Milne Bay, Papua, flying Bristol Beaufort light planes. Amid an acclimation flight he went under inviting discharge from hostile to flying machine firearms on Kiriwina Island, yet maintained a strategic distance from genuine damage. He was raised to transitory gathering skipper in December, and expected direction of No.ÃÂ 71 Wing the next month. The Beauforts of No.ÃÂ 6 Squadron and No.ÃÂ 71 Wing partook in a progression of real assaults on Rabaul, besieging and strafing landing strips, foundation and delivery; this proceeded until February 1944, when the Japanese pulled back their air ship from Rabaul. That month, Hannah became sick and must be repatriated to Australia. Following a month and a half recovery at Laverton, he came back to No.ÃÂ 6 Squadron, in light of Goodenough Island. From March to August, the squadron was fundamentally associated with guard escort and hostile to submarine obligations. In September 1944, Hannah was delegated senior air staff officer (SASO) at Headquarters Western Area Command, Perth. He took over control of the development from Air Commodore Raymond Brownell in July 1945, after Brownell's takeoff to order No.ÃÂ 11 Group in the Dutch East Indies.
