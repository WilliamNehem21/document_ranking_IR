The film's embellishments were all the while commended and bludgeoned for being in fact splendid however outwardly appalling and exorbitant. Audits called Bottin's work "virtuoso", noticing the plans were novel, extraordinary, "vividly terrible", and considered him an "ace of the horrifying". Arnold said that the "chest eat" scene illustrated "shocking inventiveness" and the consequent disjoined head scene was "frantically ghastly", contrasting them with "Alien"s chest burster and separated head scenes. "Assortment" called it "the most clearly grim blood and gore movie to ever stalk the screens". On the other hand, Denby called them more disturbing than alarming, and regretted that the pattern of blood and guts movies to open the human body increasingly more verged on indecency, Spencer said that Bottin's consideration and pride in his art was appeared in the impacts, however both they and Schickel observed them to overpower and "wasted" without solid characters and story Even thus, Canby said that the impacts were excessively "fake seeming to sicken". Canby and Arnold said the animal's absence of a solitary, perceivable shape was to its drawback, and concealing it inside people made it difficult to pursue. Arnold said that the 1951 rendition was less adaptable, yet simpler to keep in core interest.
