In May 1954, the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force (USAF), General Thomas D. White, moved toward the leader of the British Joint Staff Mission (BJSM) in Washington, DC, General Sir John Whiteley, with an idea to give the RAF an interval power of up to 90 new Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft. This spoke to about $400 million in hardware that would not be represented a mark against the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. The RAF was vigilant. The B-47 was made a decision about substandard compared to the English Electric Canberra in spite of the fact that it had more prominent range and could convey a bigger bomb load. It would require runways, and the RAF had an awful involvement with the last American-fabricated aircraft it worked, the Boeing Washington. Most importantly, there was the potential loss of glory and freedom. The head of RAF Bomber Command, Sir Hugh Lloyd, favored acknowledgment, however the Secretary of State for Air, Lord de L'Isle and Dudley, and the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys, exhorted Churchill against it. In June, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir William Dickson, educated the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Nathan Twining, that the RAF was declining the offer.
