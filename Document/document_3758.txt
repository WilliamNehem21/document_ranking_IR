Three additional magazines started distribution in 1950, all in review group. The first was "Dream Fiction", which created two issues. It incorporated some decent reproduced material from 1930s issues of "Argosy", however none of the new stories were noteworthy. In October 1950, Raymond Palmer, who had left Ziff-Davis to turn into a distributer in his very own right, propelled "Creative ability". A genuine mishap in the late spring constrained him to turn the vast majority of the altering work over to Bea Mahaffey, and after two issues he sold the magazine to William Hamling, who propped it up until 1958. The last magazine of the decade was "Universes Beyond", altered by Damon Knight, which showed up in December 1950, and went on for three month to month issues; the distributer, Hillman Periodicals, chose to scrap the magazine just days after the principal issue went on special. Each of the three issues highlighted quality work, and a considerable lot of the narratives have been reproduced as often as possible; Willam Tenn's "Invalid P" and C.M. Kornbluth's "The Mindworm" being maybe the best-known. Knight included material by non-sort journalists, for example, Graham Greene and Rudyard Kipling, alongside type names, for example, Katherine MacLean and Lester del Rey. Ashley recommends that had Knight been permitted to proceed, the magazine would have been a critical commitment to 1950s sci-fi.
