Writing in the American abstract magazine "Salmagundi", Alvin H. Rosenfeld called "The Portage" a "leap forward work" that "dumbfounds". He was struck by the book's interaction between the scene of bog and wilderness, and the "scene of discourse"Ã¢ÂÂ the previous being "splendidly enlisted" with its "huge sentiment of physicality", and the last mentioned, "significantly progressively emotional" in the manner in which it uncovered "the dim underside of words" and how its utilization and abuse uncovers the genuine idea of an individual. He was especially inspired by the portrayal of Nazi seeker Emmanuel Lieber and his job as illustrative of the Jewish cognizance. Rosenfeld noticed that while Holocaust writing regularly either takes off to "dissuasion and punctuation", or sinks to "a diminishing wail of elegiac regret", Steiner's Lieber "intervenes between these two extremes,ÃÂ ... at the same time records and grieves, briskly counts yet conveys a tremendous effect". What concerned the analyst was the manner in which Steiner utilized thoughts from his before works, that he had put them "for all intents and purposes verbatim" into Hitler's mouth, making the feeling that "Steiner's comprehension of Hitler were indistinguishable with the last's self-comprehension". Rosenfeld likewise addressed why the book needed to finish with Hitler's discourse. He said that Steiner's imaginary Hitler plays "the villain's round of language disruption", making "frenzy [sound] like music", something the genuine Hitler had culminated. By halting now, Rosenfeld felt that Steiner "succumb[s], logically, to the enchanting persuasiveness of nullification", which undermines his own "exclusive requirements of good knowledge". Be that as it may, generally speaking Rosenfeld said "The Portage" "must be considered as a part of the most incredible endeavors to depict the nearness and significance of Hitler", compelling us to go up against him "in a way scarcely observed before in fiction".
