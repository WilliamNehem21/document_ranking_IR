"Persoonia levis" was described and given the name "Linkia levis" by Antonio JosÃ© Cavanilles in 1798. His description was based on plant material collected by Luis NÃ©e in the vicinity of Port Jackson (Sydney) in April 1793 during the Malaspina Expedition. The species was placed in the genus "Persoonia" by Karel Domin in 1921. The genus names "Linkia" and "Persoonia" had been coined in 1798, but the latter was officially conserved. The species name is the Latin adjective "", meaning "smooth", and refers to the hairless foliage. Christiaan Hendrik Persoon coined the name "Persoonia salicina" for it in his 1805 work "Synopsis Plantarum", and queried whether Cavanilles' "Linkia levis" was in fact "P.Â lanceolata". Robert Brown used Persoon's name in his 1810 work "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen", and echoed Persoon's thoughts on Cavanilles' original name and specimen. In the 1995 "Flora of Australia" revision of the genus, Peter John Weston reviewed the mounted material of "Linkia levis", and found that Cavanilles had mounted material from both "P.Â levis" and "P.Â lanceolata". He set one specimen of the three, which was clearly "P.Â levis", as the lectotype, which aligned the material with the description. Common names include broad-leaved geebung, willow geebung and smooth geebung. The term geebung is derived from the Dharug language word "geebung".
