The last demonstration proceeds with Andre's declaration; she is currently serious instead of rebellious. She says that she, Faulkner, and Regan had schemed to counterfeit Faulkner's suicide so they could escape with cash stolen from Whitfield. Regan, who was likewise infatuated with Andre, gave the stolen body of his effectively dead group partner, "Lefty" O'Toole, to toss from the structure. In interrogation, Flint proposes Andre and Regan were utilizing learning of past crimes to extort Faulkner. Stevens at that point calls Regan, who affirms that he was because of meet Faulkner at an escape plane in the wake of leaving the stolen body with Andre; in any case, Faulkner did not arrive and the plane was absent. Rather than Faulkner, Regan experienced Whitfield, who gave him a watch that was, as per Regan, to purchase his quietness. Regan later found the missing plane, which had been scorched with what he presumes is Faulkner's body inside. Stone's questioning offers an elective hypothesis: Regan put the stolen body into the plane to make question about Andre's blame, and the check from Whitfield was insurance cash to Regan's pack. In the play's Broadway and beginner forms, the following observer is Roberta Van Rensselaer, an outlandish artist and spouse of O'Toole, who trusts Regan murdered her better half. This character does not show up in Rand's favored rendition of the play. Stevens at that point reviews two observers to catch up on issues from Regan's declaration. The barrier and arraignment at that point give their end contentions.
