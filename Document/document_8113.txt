The show opened on July 9, 1962, with Warhol missing. The thirty-two single soup can canvases were set in a solitary line, much like items on racks, each showed on tight individual edges. The contemporary effect was uneventful, yet the authentic effect is viewed as today to have been a watershed. The display crowd was uncertain what to make of the show. A John Coplans "Artforum" article, which was to a limited extent prodded on by the reacting show of many soup jars by a close-by exhibition with a showcase publicizing them at three for 60 pennies, urged individuals to stand firm on Warhol. Barely any really observed the artistic creations at the Los Angeles show or at Warhol's studio, however word spread as discussion and embarrassment because of the work's appearing endeavor to repeat the presence of made articles. Broadened banter on the benefits and morals of concentrating one's endeavors on such an everyday business lifeless model kept Warhol's work in workmanship world discussions. The savants couldn't trust a craftsman would diminish the artistic expression to what might be compared to an outing to the nearby supermarket. Talk did not convert into money related accomplishment for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of just about six to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum chose to endeavor to keep the thirty-two canvases as an unblemished set and repurchased the couple of offers. This satisfied Warhol who had considered them as a set, and he consented to sell the set for ten month to month $100 portions to Blum. Warhol had passed the achievement of his first genuine workmanship appear. While this display was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson dropped another arranged December 1962 New York show.
