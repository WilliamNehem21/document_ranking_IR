In late February 1730, with LouboÃÂ«y looking to get the Natchez off guard, Natchez arranged a harmony bargain and liberated French hostages, yet the French arranged an assault on the Natchez fortification the next day. The Natchez at that point conveyed blessings to LouboÃÂ«y, yet left their fortress that night and got away over the Mississippi River, taking African slaves with them. The following day, LouboÃÂ«y and his men torched the deserted Grand Village post as the Natchez stowed away in the sounds along the Black River. A consequent undertaking driven by PÃÂ©rier in 1731 to remove the Natchez caught a large number of them and their pioneers, including Saint Cosme, who was the new Great Sun, and his momÃ¢ÂÂthe Female Sun, Tattooed Arm. The 387 prisoners, the greater part of whom had a place with the star French group of the Natchez, were sold into subjugation in Saint-Domingue. Numerous other Natchez got away once more, presently taking shelter with the Chickasaw. Throughout the following decade the couple of hundred outstanding Natchez carried on with an actual existence on the run, pursuing a low-power guerrilla battle against the French. French antiquarian Pierre FranÃÂ§ois Xavier de Charlevoix wrote in his history, "We were not moderate in seeing that the Natchez could at present render themselves considerable, and that the progression of sending the Sun and the sum total of what who had been taken with him to be sold as slaves in Saint-Domingue, had preferably exasperated over threatened the leftover of that country, in whom contempt and misery had changed their common pride and fierceness into a valor of which they were never esteemed able."
