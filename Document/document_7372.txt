The show's broad utilization of research in its improvement and generation process enlivened a few examinations that gave proof to its viability as a learning apparatus. Field tests demonstrated that the consideration and understanding of youthful watchers expanded with each continue seeing. In 1999, Anderson and a group of analysts, some of which were his partners at Nickelodeon, examined how scene reiteration influenced cognizance, gathering of people investment, and visual consideration. The analysts tried whether rehashed viewings of the show brought about authority over the material exhibited, or whether watchers would habituate or end up exhausted. They found that gathering of people investment was lower for the initial couple of viewings, since youngsters gave more consideration to new material, and in light of the fact that it was all the more intellectually requesting to comprehend and take care of the issues introduced. After five viewings, a greater amount of the watchers' psychological assets were accessible for collaboration and interest, so they responded to more inquiries. Scene redundancy appeared to engage watchers, as appeared in their eager endeavors to take care of the issues displayed to them. Redundancy, which the scientists called "an economical device to amplify cognizance," improved appreciation, held kids' consideration, and expanded crowd interest. Youngsters were not just tolerant of redundancy, they were "decidedly eager" about it. Nielsen evaluations of the show's first season, when a similar scene was appeared, were level over the five-day time frame, which demonstrated to Anderson that youthful kids did not feel worn out on its redundancy or of its unpredictability after some time. Anderson and Crawley felt that the broadcast procedure helped increment the show's evaluations and considered it a triumph.
