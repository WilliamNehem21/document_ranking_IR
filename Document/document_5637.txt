Whenever "Australia" was decommissioned in 1921, a portion of her gear was evacuated for use in different boats, yet after the November 1923 Cabinet choice affirming the abandoning, RAN faculty and private contractual workers started to expel funneling and other little fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, ÃÂ£68,000 of hardware was recovered; over half was given to tertiary training focuses (some of which was still being used during the 1970s), while the rest was either set apart for use in future warships, or sold as trinkets. Some thought was given to reusing "Australia"s 12-inch firearms in beach front fortresses, yet this did not happen as ammo for these weapons was never again being produced by the British, and the expense of structure appropriate structures was inordinate. It was rather chosen to sink the weapon turrets and extra barrels with the remainder of the ship. There was likewise a proposition to evacuate "Australia"s conning tower and introduce it on the Sydney Harbor foreshore; in spite of the fact that this did not proceed, the thought was later utilized when the foremast of was raised as a landmark at Bradleys Head. The ship's external port propeller is in plain view at the Australian War Memorial, while different ancient rarities are in the accumulations of the War Memorial, the Australian National Maritime Museum, and the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Center.
