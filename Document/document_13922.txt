The amount of this account was Geoffrey's very own innovation is available to discuss. He appears to have utilized the rundown of Arthur's twelve fights against the Saxons found in the ninth century "Historia Brittonum", alongside the clash of Camlann from the "Annales Cambriae" and the possibility that Arthur was as yet alive. Arthur's status as the ruler of all Britain is by all accounts acquired from pre-Galfridian convention, being found in "Culhwch and Olwen", the Welsh Triads, and the holy people's lives. At long last, Geoffrey acquired a considerable lot of the names for Arthur's assets, close family, and buddies from the pre-Galfridian Welsh convention, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and maybe likewise Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the last getting to be Excalibur in ensuing Arthurian stories. Be that as it may, while names, key occasions, and titles may have been obtained, Brynley Roberts has contended that "the Arthurian segment is Geoffrey's scholarly creation and it owes nothing to earlier story." Geoffrey makes the Welsh Medraut into the disgusting Modredus, yet there is no hint of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the sixteenth century. There have been moderately couple of present day endeavors to challenge the idea that the "Historia Regum Britanniae" is fundamentally Geoffrey's very own work, with insightful assessment frequently reverberating William of Newburgh's late-twelfth century remark that Geoffrey "made up" his story, maybe through an "excessive love of lying". Geoffrey Ashe is one nonconformist from this view, trusting that Geoffrey's account is somewhat gotten from a lost source recounting the deeds of a fifth century British ruler named Riotamus, this figure being the first Arthur, in spite of the fact that history specialists and Celticists have been hesitant to pursue Ashe in his decisions.
