After extra climate related deferrals, on 26 February salvors figured out how to skim the bow segment and started the way toward towing it out to ocean for transfer. By 1 March, the tugboat "Ocean Victory" had towed the bow from the shoreline and out to ocean, at first pursued by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV "Oregon Responder". Be that as it may, another extreme tempest constrained the skimmer back to port, and when the pull was off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow area skimmed for fourteen hours until it steered into the rocks close Waldport, Oregon on 3 March, roughly toward the north of the first establishing site. On 8 March, the bow was again refloated, and by 11 March it was effectively towed off the coast via "Ocean Victory" and a second pull, "Natoma". At this area, the Pacific Ocean is around profound. The bow was sunk by two US Navy delivers, the destroyer and the submarine . Four hundred pounds (180ÃÂ kg) of high explosives were appended to the bow and exploded. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from "David R. Ray"s deck weapons at that point punctured the frame. Following 40 minutes, the ship was as yet above water with dimness and a tempest drawing closer. To facilitate the sinking, "Bremerton" terminated a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Inside ten minutes, the bow area overwhelmed and sank stern-first, catching the rest of the oil inside.
