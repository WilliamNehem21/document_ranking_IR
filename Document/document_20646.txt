The origins of the band date back to 1988, while Reznor was employed as a janitor at a studio in Cleveland. Utilizing off-hour sessions, Reznor recorded and released the band's debut album, the synth-pop oriented "Pretty Hate Machine" (1989), under TVT Records to minor success. However, Reznor feuded with the label about promotion. While attempting to terminate his contract, Reznor signed with Interscope Records and released the extended play "Broken" (1992), a release that diverged significantly from the sound of their debut. Their second and third albums, "The Downward Spiral" (1994) and "The Fragile" (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success, bringing the band massive popularity, before going on hiatus. The band resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, "With Teeth" (2005), to further success. Following the release of their fifth album, "Year Zero" (2007), Reznor left Interscope over a dispute of physical copies of the album. The band continued touring and independently released their sixth and seventh albums, "Ghosts I-IV" (2008) and "The Slip" (2008), before going on hiatus a second time. Returning in 2013, the band released their eighth album, "Hesitation Marks" (2013), under Columbia Records, followed by a trilogy of releases spanning from 2016-2018, including the EPs "Not The Actual Events" (2016) and "Add Violence" (2017), as well as their ninth album, "Bad Witch" (2018).
