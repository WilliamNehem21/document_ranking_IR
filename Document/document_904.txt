Robert Weinberg, in his history of "Bizarre Tales", concurs with Ashley that the nature of Baird's issues was poor, however remarks that some great stories were distributed: "it was only that the level of such stories was horridly little". Weinberg singles out "A Square of Canvas" by Rud, and "Past the Door" by Paul Suter as "outstanding"; both showed up in the April 1923 issue. Weinberg additionally respects "The Floor Above" by M. L. Humphries and "Penelope" by Vincent Starrett, both from the May 1923 issue, and "Lucifer" by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as essential, and remarks that "The Rats in the Walls", in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft's best stories. It is misty whether Baird or Henneberger was in charge of purchasing Lovecraft's accounts; in one of Lovecraft's letters he clarifies that Baird was quick to obtain his accounts, however Henneberger has said that he abrogated Baird and that Baird disliked Lovecraft's composition. It was Henneberger who concocted another thought including Lovecraft: Henneberger reached Harry Houdini and made courses of action to have Lovecraft secretly compose a story for him utilizing a plot provided by Houdini. The story, "Detained with the Pharaohs", showed up under Houdini's name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, however it was about lostÃ¢ÂÂLovecraft left the composed composition on the train he took to New York to get hitched, and subsequently spent a lot of his big day retyping the original copy from the longhand duplicate despite everything he had.
