Confronting collected obligations (counting installments for her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a cheat including gold exchange. Two men, one named Stevenson and the other John Thomas, professed to currently possess a store of gold pirated out of South Carolina. They offered this treasureÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ worth about US$5,000, they claimedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ for US$2,000 in real money. They demanded that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she brought them into her home, where they remained for a few days. She realized that white individuals in the South had covered resources when Union powers compromised the district, and furthermore that dark men were often relegated to burrowing obligations. In this manner the circumstance appeared to be conceivable, and a blend of her money related misfortunes and her considerate mindset drove her to oblige the arrangement. She acquired the cash from a rich companion named Anthony Shimer, and organized to get the gold late one night. When the men had tricked her into the forested areas, in any case, they assaulted her and thumped her out with chloroform, at that point stole her handbag and bound and choked her. When she was found by her family, she was disoriented and harmed, and the cash was no more.
