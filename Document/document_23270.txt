Manta rays have broad heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on either side of their mouths. They have horizontally flattened bodies with eyes on the sides of their heads behind the cephalic fins, and gill slits on their ventral surfaces. Their tails lack skeletal support and are shorter than their disc-like bodies. The dorsal fins are small and at the base of the tail. The largest mantas can reach . In both species, the width is about 2.2 times the length of the body; "M. birostris" reaches at least in width, while "M. alfredi" reaches about . Dorsally, mantas are typically black or dark in color with pale markings on their "shoulders". Ventrally, they are usually white or pale with distinctive dark markings by which individual mantas can be recognized. All-black color morphs are known to exist. The skin is covered in mucus which protects it from infection.
The two species of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. "M. birostris" has more angular shoulder markings, larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins, and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of "M. alfredi" are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in "M. birostris", while those of "M. alfredi" are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small, square-shaped teeth on the lower jaw, but "M. birostris" also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike "M. alfredi", "M. birostris" has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.
