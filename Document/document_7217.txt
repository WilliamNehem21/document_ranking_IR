In 1075, amid William's nonappearance, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil the Earl of Hereford, plotted to oust him in the Revolt of the Earls. The careful purpose behind the defiance is indistinct, yet it was propelled at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger's, held at Exning. Another baron, Waltheof, in spite of being one of William's top picks, was likewise included, and some Breton rulers were prepared to offer help. Ralph likewise mentioned Danish guide. William stayed in Normandy while his men in England quelled the revolt. Roger was unfit to leave his fortification in Herefordshire due to endeavors by Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester, and ÃÂthelwig, the Abbot of Evesham. Ralph was restrained in Norwich Castle by the joined endeavors of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey of Coutances, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Norwich was assaulted and surrendered, and Ralph went into outcast. In the mean time, the Danish lord's sibling, Cnut, had at last touched base in England with an armada of 200 boats, however he was past the point of no return as Norwich had just surrendered. The Danes at that point attacked along the coast before returning home. William did not come back to England until some other time in 1075, to manage the Danish danger and the result of the disobedience, observing Christmas at Winchester. Roger and Waltheof were kept in jail, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. At that point William had come back to the mainland, where Ralph was proceeding with the resistance from Brittany.
