On 10 September the division achieved a quality of 126 officers, 374 non-appointed officers and 3,293 men, made out of German officers and Bosnian Muslim warriors, a small amount of its recommended quality of 19,000 men. At this point, spirit was winding down inside the new division similarly as it finished the last period of its preparation in Hungary; the war was not going great, and there were gossipy tidbits that the Germans were going to relinquish the Balkans and leave the Muslims to guard themselves. Looked with high rates of abandonment from the thirteenth SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed an arrangement to incapacitate the Bosnians in the two divisions, and on 18 September made a trip to see Himmler. The "ReichsfÃÂ¼hrer-SS" rather settled on an arrangement to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division to the region of tasks of the thirteenth SS Division in Bosnia and re-compose the two divisions there. Battle arms units from the thirteenth SS Division were to be brought under the immediate control of IX "Waffen" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian), which would likewise move to Bosnia. Issued on 24 September, the arrangement dropped the development of the 23rd SS Division, and coordinated "SS OberfÃÂ¼hrer" (Senior Colonel) Gustav Lombard to frame and order another SS infantry division utilizing the German unit and gear of the 23rd SS Division, enhanced by ethnic Germans enrolled from Hungary. The Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division were to be transported by rail back to the GradiÃÂ¡te-ÃÂ½upanja-BoÃÂ¡njaci region for re-association into "another" "Kama" division.
