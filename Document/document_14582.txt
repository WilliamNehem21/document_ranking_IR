The exaltation of Macedonian rulers maybe started with the demise of PhilipII, yet it was his child Alexander the Great who unambiguously professed to be a living god. Following his visit to the prophet of Didyma in 334BC that recommended his eternality, Alexander headed out to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon Ã¢ÂÂ what might be compared to the Egyptian Amun-Ra Ã¢ÂÂ at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to affirm his awesome status. In spite of the fact that the Ptolemaic and Seleucid domains kept up familial religions and revered their rulers, rulers were not loved in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks preceding Alexander's rule, especially at the Greek province of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the principal Macedonian ruler to belittle Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian brotherhoods and gods, reinforcing the combination of Near Eastern and Greek religious convictions. After his rule, the religion of Isis steadily spread all through the Hellenistic and Roman world, while convictions in the Egyptian god Sarapis were completely Hellenized by the Ptolemaic leaders of Egypt before the spread of his faction to Macedonia and the Aegean district. The German antiquarian Johann Gustav Droysen contended that the triumphs of Alexander the Great and making of the Hellenistic world took into consideration the development and foundation of Christianity in the Roman time.
