A contemporary review by Barry Simon of "PC Magazine" praised the game's graphical capabilities as having a "Nintendo feel", though he termed the graphics as "well drawn" but "not spectacular" in terms of resolution. He noted that the game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for "its scintillating plot or ground-breaking originality", but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that the scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games. A short summary of the trilogy in 1992 in "PC World" termed it "one of the most spectacular games available" and praised the "superb" sound and graphics, while a similar summary in "CQ Amateur Radio" described it as "Nintendo comes to the PC" and the "best action/adventure game" the reviewer had ever seen. In October 1992, the Shareware Industry Awards gave the "Commander Keen" series the "Best Entertainment Software and Best Overall" award. A review of the entire "Commander Keen" series in 1993 by Sandy Petersen in the first "Eye of the Monitor" column for "Dragon" described the series as action games with "hilarious graphics". Acknowledging its debt to "Super Mario Bros.", he called it, including the Vorticon trilogy, "one of the best games of its type" and praised it for not being "mindlessly hard", though still requiring some thought to play through, and especially for the humor in the graphics and gameplay.
