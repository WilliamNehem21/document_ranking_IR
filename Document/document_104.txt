In the wake of recommissioning, "Argus" filled in as a preparation bearer to enable pilots to rehearse their deck-arrival abilities. She was doing this obligation in the Gulf of Lion when the Second World War started. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two QF Mk V 4-inch hostile to airplane weapons on her quarterdeck, just as three fourfold Vickers .50ÃÂ machine firearm mounts; one of these was on each side of her structure and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck. Together with the battlecruiser and six destroyers, "Argus" escorted Convoy US-3, stacked with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June. After seven days, she carried Supermarine Walrus creatures of land and water of 701 Squadron to ReykjavÃÂ­k, Iceland. "Argus" stacked twelve Hawker Hurricane and two Blackburn Skua warriors of 418 Flight RAF in late July for conveyance to Malta as a component of Operation Hurry. Escorted by "Ark Royal", three ships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without episode on 2 August 1940 from a point west of Sicily, albeit two of the Hurricanes slammed on landing. Joined by the war vessel and escorted by two destroyers, she came back to Liverpool to stack 30 Hurricanes with their wings expelled. "Argus" cruised on 22 August and landed at Takoradi on the Gold Coast on 5 September where her flying machine were off-stacked. After her arrival to the United Kingdom, the ship was quickly refitted and she carried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.
