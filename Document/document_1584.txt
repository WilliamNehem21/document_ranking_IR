Notwithstanding the Munich arrangement Solti picked up an account contract in 1946. He marked for Decca Records, not as a conductor but rather as a piano accompanist. He made his first chronicle in 1947, playing Brahms' First Violin Sonata with the musician Georg Kulenkampff. He was stubborn that he needed to lead, and Decca gave him his first chronicle sessions as a director later around the same time, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's "Egmont" suggestion. After twenty years Solti stated, "I'm certain it's a horrendous record, on the grounds that the ensemble was bad around then and I was so energized. It is shocking, most likely horribleÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ however at this point it has evaporated." He needed to hang tight two years for his next account as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's "Drum Roll" ensemble, in sessions delivered by John Culshaw, with whose vocation Solti's turned out to be firmly connected throughout the following two decades. Assessing the record, "The Gramophone" stated, "The execution of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine director who is different to me) is striking for cadenced playing, extravagance of tone, and clearness of execution." "The Record Guide" contrasted it positively and EMI's opponent account by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.
