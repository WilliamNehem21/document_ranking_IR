The initial two issues highlighted Algis Budrys' tale "The Man From Earth", and Philip K. Dick's introduction novel, under the title "A Glass of Darkness". Both were changed and showed up as soft cover books in the following couple of years, titled "Man of Earth" and "The Cosmic Puppets", separately. The elevated expectation of these two issues couldn't be kept up, and in the supposition of sf history specialists Malcolm Edwards and Mike Ashley the magazine's quality declined from that point. Hal Clement's "Planet for Plunder", which showed up in the third issue, was told from the perspective of an outsider set for Earth. It was too short to even think about fitting Margulies' arrangement of distributing a lead novel, so Merwin composed extra parts from the human viewpoint, and substituted the two points of view in the distributed form. Ashley talks exceedingly of Clement's unique novella, which was in the long run distributed without the augmentations in 1972, and remarks that Merwin's increments fill in as "an item exercise in how to destroy a decent story". Edwards and Ashley single out two different books as deserving of notice: J.T. McIntosh's "One Million Cities" (in the August 1958 issue), and Jack Vance's "The Languages of Pao" (December 1957), portrayed by sf faultfinders Peter Nicholls and David Langford as "a standout amongst the most clever uses in sort sf" of the Whorf speculation Ã¢ÂÂ the hypothesis that the language one talks decides one's impression of the real world. Plain Belknap Long's epic "Mission to a Distant Star" (February1958) was at one point considered for distribution as the main novel in the arranged Renown Books line.
