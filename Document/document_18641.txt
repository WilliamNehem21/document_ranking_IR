Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, "Herrerasaurus" has at times been considered basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to be inside Dinosauria. They supported this on the basis that "Herrerasaurus" has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered "Staurikosaurus" and "Herrerasaurus" to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of "Herrerasaurus" and "Staurikosaurus" and all its descendants. A differing definition of "Herrerasaurus" but not "Passer domesticus" first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as "Herrerasaurus" but not "Liliensternus" or "Plateosaurus" by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.
In a revision of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed the definition of the clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of "Triceratops" and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and "Eoraptor". Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and "Eoraptor" lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.
