Starting with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou utilized the equivalent "composing custom" for a long time. She would wake promptly toward the beginning of the day and register with a lodging, where the staff was told to expel any photos from the dividers. She would compose on lawful cushions while lying on the bed, with just a jug of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and would leave by the early evening. She would average 10Ã¢ÂÂ 12 pages of composed material daily, which she altered down to three or four pages at night. She experienced this procedure to "charm" herself, and as she said in a 1989 meeting with the British Broadcasting Corporation, "remember the desolation, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She set herself back in the time she expounded on, even awful encounters, for example, her assault in "Confined Bird", so as to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou expressed that she played cards so as to get to that spot of charm and so as to get to her recollections all the more adequately. She stated, "It might take an hour to get into it, however once I'm in itÃ¢ÂÂha! It's so scrumptious!" She didn't discover the procedure cathartic; rather, she discovered alleviation in "coming clean".
