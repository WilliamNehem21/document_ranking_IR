The deferrals in getting the overland supply course sorted out and the seventh Division itself prepared implied that, in the underlying phases of the task in any event, the seventh Division would need to be kept up via air. Vasey further recommended that the greater part of his powers keep away from a tiring overland walk by moving legitimately to Nadzab via air, which expanded the significance of catching Nadzab early. MacArthur consented to make the second Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment based at close-by Gordonvale, Queensland, accessible to New Guinea Force to catch Nadzab. He further approved the regiment to direct preparing with the seventh Division and various activities were led. Colonel Kenneth H. Kinsler, the authority of the 503rd, anxious to examine the Battle of Crete with the 21st Infantry Brigade's Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, made the irregular stride of parachuting into Ravenshoe. On 31 July, Vasey raised the possibility of using the whole regiment with Kinsler. Blamey took up the issue with MacArthur, who approved it on 8 August. Blamey made the Australian Army transport accessible to deliver the regiment from Cairns to Port Moresby, with the exception of the second Battalion and advance gathering, which moved via air as initially arranged.
