The piece of the scene compares the demure and legitimate Huguenot man and his perfectly dressed spouse and child with these three, as they structure their own "family gathering" over the opposite side of the canal. The head of John the Baptist on a platter is the commercial for the pie shop, broadcasting "Great eating". Underneath this sign are the grasping couple, broadening the representation of good eating past a minor plate of sustenance, and still further down the road young lady ravenously gathers up the pie, conveying the subject to the foot of the image. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as an image of the turmoil on this side of the road. The man decreased to a head on the sign, in what is thought to be the lady's dream, is reflected by the "Great Woman" imagined on the board behind who has just a body, her bothering head evacuated to make the man's optimal of a "decent lady". In the top window of the "Great Woman", a lady tosses a plate with a leg of meat into the road as she contends, giving a conspicuous difference to the "great" lady envisioned on the sign underneath. Ronald Paulson sees the kite dangling from the congregation as a feature of a trinity of signs; the kite demonstrating the motivation behind the congregation, climb into paradise, similarly as different signs for "Good Eating" and the "Great Woman" show the preferences of those on that side of the road. In any case, he likewise notes it as another gesture to the peaceful convention: here as opposed to taking off over the fields it hangs ineptly on the congregation divider.
