"Astraeus pteridis" is larger, or more when expanded, and often has a more pronounced areolate pattern on the inner surface of the rays. It is found in North America and the Canary Islands. "A.Â asiaticus" and "A.Â odoratus" are two similar species known from throughout Asia and Southeast Asia, respectively. "A.Â odoratus" is distinguished from "A.Â hygrometricus" by a smooth outer mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles, 3â9 broad rays, and a fresh odor similar to moist soil. The spore ornamentation of "A.Â odoratus" is also distinct from "A.Â hygrometricus", with longer and narrower spines that often joined together. "A.Â asiaticus" has an outer peridial surface covered with small granules, and a gleba that is purplish-chestnut in color, compared to the smooth peridial surface and brownish gleba of "A.Â hygrometricus". The upper limit of the spore size of "A.Â asiaticus" is larger than that of its more common relative, ranging from 8.75â15.2Â Î¼m. "A.Â koreanus" (sometimes named as the variety "A.Â hygrometricus" var. "koreanus"; see Taxonomy) differs from the more common form in its smaller size, paler fruit body, and greater number of rays; microscopically, it has smaller spores (between 6.8 and 9Â Î¼m in diameter), and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology. It is known from Korea and Japan.
