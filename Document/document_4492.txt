By 2000, Tyndall was starting to foment against Griffin's authority, scrutinizing the foundation of the gathering's Ethnic Liaison Committee Ã¢ÂÂ which had one half-Turkish part (Lawrence Rustem) Ã¢ÂÂ as a move towards conceding non-whites into the gathering. He was additionally incredulous of Griffin's surrender of the gathering's necessary evacuation of transients and non-whites from the nation, trusting that on the off chance that they remained in an isolated framework, at that point Britain would take after politically-sanctioned racial segregation time South Africa, which he didn't believe was best. His principle reactions were centered not around the gathering's altering course, yet on Griffin's character itself, depicting him as corrupt and egotistical. Tyndall was resolved to retake control of the gathering, and in this was bolstered by a gathering of gathering hardliners. Amid a proposed authority challenge, Tyndall set forward his name, in spite of the fact that pulled back it following the 2001 general race when Griffin drove the BNP to a reasonable development in appointive help. Tyndall by and by trusted that the BNP's discretionary achievement had less to do with Griffin's changes and more to do with outer factors, for example, the 2001 Oldham riots. Thus, Griffin scrutinized Tyndall in the pages of "Personality", asserting that the last was focused on "the sub-Mosleyite wackiness of Arnold Leese's Imperial Fascist League and the Big Government craziness of the 1930s". Griffin ousted Tyndall from the gathering in August 2003, however needed to permit his arrival following an out-of-court settlement soon after.
