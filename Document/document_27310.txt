Early on SeptemberÂ 6, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Maemi. With more favorable conditions, including lesser wind shear and enhanced outflow, the storm continued to intensify. The JMA upgraded Maemi to a severe tropical storm on SeptemberÂ 7 and to typhoon statusÂ â winds of over 119Â km/h (74Â mph)Â â the next day. The JTWC had upgraded Maemi to typhoon status on SeptemberÂ 7 after an eye feature appeared on satellite imagery. Also around that time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the storm, giving it the local name "Pogi", although the typhoon would remain away from the country. On SeptemberÂ 8, Maemi began undergoing rapid deepening due to enhanced outflow, aided by the flow of an approaching shortwave trough. At 1200Â UTC on SeptemberÂ 9, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 240Â km/h (150Â mph) and designated Maemi as a super typhoon. The next day, the same agency estimated peak winds of 280Â km/h (175Â mph) and gusts to 335Â km/h (205Â mph), the equivalent of a CategoryÂ 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At 1200Â UTC on SeptemberÂ 10, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195Â km/h (120Â mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of while the storm was 155Â km (100Â mi) southeast of the Japanese island of Miyako-jima. At peak intensity, Maemi was a small typhoon, with gale-force winds extending only 240Â km (150Â mi) from the well-defined eye.
