The "Wenxian Tongkao" describes the main religions of Nubia, including the "Da Qin" religion (i.e. Christianity, particularly Nestorian Christianity associated with the Eastern Roman Empire) and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the "Da shi" (i.e. the Muslim Arabs). These passages are ultimately derived from the "Jingxingji" of Du Huan (fl. 8th century), a travel writer during the Chinese Tang dynasty (618â907) who was captured by Abbasid forces in the 751 Battle of Talas, after which he visited parts of West Asia and northeast Africa. Historian Wolbert Smidt identified the territory of "Molin" in Du's "Jingxingji" (preserved in part by the "Tongdian" of Du You) as the Christian kingdom of Muqurra in Nubia. He also associated the territory of "Laobosa" ("Lao-p'o-sa") depicted therein with Abyssinia, thereby making this the first Chinese text to describe Ethiopia. When Du Huan left the region to return home, he did so through the Aksumite port of Adulis. Trade activity between Ethiopia and China during the latter's Song dynasty (960â1279) seems to be confirmed by Song-Chinese coinage found in the medieval village of Harla, near Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. The Chinese Ming dynasty (1368â1644) sent diplomats to Ethiopia, which was also frequented by Chinese merchants. Although only private and indirect trade was conducted with African countries during the early Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644â1911), the Chinese were able to refer to Chinese-written travel literature and histories about East Africa before diplomatic relations were restored with African countries in the 19th century.
