The album's unorthodox distribution methods also garnered the attention of various news agencies, such as "Wired"'s Eliot Van Buskirk, who labeled "Ghosts" as "a remarkably extensive release". Ben Worthen of "The Wall Street Journal" hypothesized that "most business execsÂ [...] could learn a lot from [Reznor's] experiments with online business models." Many news agencies compared the release to Radiohead's 2007 "pay what you want" digital release of "In Rainbows", as well as the similar release of Saul Williams' album "The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!" the same year, which Reznor produced. "Rolling Stone"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review called the album a "a new-media showpiece", while Tiny Mix Tapes said "the circumstances surrounding the release are so forward-thinking that they could be considered just as key to appreciating the album as the music itself." Financial website The Motley Fool wrote an article on the album's release titled "Music Industry Gets Nailed Again", forecasting that "Innovators like Nine Inch Nails are paving the way for new media business models that may bypass the middleman while making sure artists "and" fans are happy." In its review of "The Slip", however, PopMatters described "Ghosts IâIV" in retrospect as an "aimless batch ofÂ ... instrumentals packaged in a brilliant marketing scheme" and said that it was "basically a CD release with a couple of mail-order special editions available for the 'true fans'."
