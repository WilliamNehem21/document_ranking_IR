The proprietor of The Plumbers Arms depicted how Lady Lucan had entered his bar secured "head to toe in blood" before she fell into "a condition of stun". He guaranteed that she yelled "Help me, help me, I've recently gotten away from being killed" and "My kids, my youngsters, he's killed my caretaker". Pathologist Keith Simpson plot his posthumous examination, presuming that passing was brought about by "obtuse head wounds" and "inward breath of blood". He affirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was in all probability in charge of Rivett's wounds; a few, to one side eye and mouth, he thought bound to have been brought about by punches from a held clench hand. The last individual to affirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the baron looked "rumpled", and his hair "somewhat unsettled". His pants had a sodden fix on the correct hip. Lucan had revealed to her that he was strolling, or going by the house when he saw Veronica being assaulted by a man. He let himself in yet slipped in a pool of blood at the base of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the assailant kept running off, and that Veronica was "exceptionally insane" and blamed him for having enlisted a contract killer to execute her.
