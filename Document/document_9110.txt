After the debut race, coordinators improved the checking of the trail for the primary challenge held in the WhitehorseÃ¢ÂÂ Fairbanks course. Musher Bill Cotter stated, "The trail was nice to the point that it was hard to keep from going excessively quick." The race developed in ubiquity throughout the following couple of years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 finished the raceÃ¢ÂÂthe most that have ever completed it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs turned into the first (thus far just) mother and little girl to contend in a similar Yukon Quest: Terri completed 21st, beating her mom (22nd) by 26ÃÂ minutes. The 1991 race saw eight groups pull back in the primary quarter as a result of an episode of a canine malady called the "Healy Virus". Thirty-five additional mutts were sickened before the spread of the infection was ended by colder climate part of the way through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused issues in the main portion of the race, and the second was influenced by harsh virus. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was supplanted after she offered canine needle therapy to a few mushers. In spite of the fact that not then taboo by any standard, this abused equivalent treatment rules since she didn't offer the treatment to each musher. Toward the finish of that race, George Cook turned into the principal musher since 1984 to complete shy of Whitehorse when untamed water on the Yukon River kept him from proceeding. Since he didn't stop, race authorities gave him the Red Lantern Award.
