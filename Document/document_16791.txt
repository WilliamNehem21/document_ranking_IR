At the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2010, Larson appeared in a stage production of Thornton Wilder's play "Our Town". Directed by Nicholas Martin, it featured her in the role of Emily Webb, a precocious young girl. Reviewing the play for "The Boston Globe", Louise Kennedy thought that the production had glossed over the play's darker themes and bemoaned the lack of tragic arc in Larson's character. In film, she featured in Noah Baumbach's comedy-drama "Greenberg" and Edgar Wright's comedy "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World". A journalist for "Slant Magazine" opined that these films helped raise her profile, and Larson has said that the latter film, in which she played a rock star named Envy, marked a turning point in her career. In it, Larson performed the song "Black Sheep" with the band Metric. Although it did not do well commercially, "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" has since developed a cult following. She next played the troubled daughter of a corrupt cop (played by Woody Harrelson) in the drama "Rampart" (2011), an emotionally intense part she found herself unable to detach from. A confrontation scene between Harrelson and her proved upsetting for her; the director was surprised by how well it turned out and tweaked the script to further explore the father-daughter relationship.
