York made a good start to 1993â94, before a series of poor results saw them slip to 17th place in late November 1993. They only lost five of their last 30 fixtures to finish the season fifth in the Second Division tableâtheir highest league placing since 1976. They lost to Stockport County in the play-off semi-final, being beaten 1â0 in the second leg at Edgeley Park after drawing 0â0 at home in the first leg. York were in lower midtable for the first half of 1994â95, but improving form saw them move up the table, before finishing in ninth place. They struggled through most of 1995â96, and only avoided relegation by winning their last match away to Brighton & Hove Albion; they finished in 20th place. This season saw York record a 4â3 aggregate victory over Manchester United in the League Cup second round. York defeated a strong United team including some younger players 3â0 at Old Trafford in the first leg; in the second leg, United fielded some more experienced players, and despite losing 3â1, York progressed on aggregate. United went on to win the Premier League and FA Cup double. York finished 20th in 1996â97, only securing safety in the penultimate match with an away win over Rotherham United. For the second consecutive season, they eliminated Premier League opponents from the League Cup in the second round, with a 4â3 aggregate win over Everton. After drawing the first leg 1â1 at Goodison Park, York progressed after winning the second leg 3â2 at home. In mid December 1997, York were fourth in the table, but declining form after New Year saw them finish 1997â98 in 16th place.
