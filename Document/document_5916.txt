Niffenegger is a craftsman who instructs at the Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she gets ready releases of handpainted books. She delivered a portion of her prior works in versions of ten duplicates, which were sold in workmanship displays. In any case, she chose that "The Time Traveler's Wife" would need to be a novel: "I got the thought for the title, and when I draw I have this enormous illustration table secured with dark colored paper, and I record thoughts on the paper. So I recorded this title and inevitably I began to consider it. I couldn't think about an approach to make it an image book since still pictures don't speak to time great, so I chose to compose a novel." She was charmed by the title since "it quickly characterized two individuals and their relationship to one another". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel "Man and Time": "Clock time is our bank chief, charge gatherer, police monitor; this inward time is our better half." Drawing her focal subject from this picture, she says, "Henry isn't just hitched to Clare; he's likewise hitched to time." Other writers whom Niffenegger has refered to as affecting the book incorporate Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.
