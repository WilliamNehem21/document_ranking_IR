Manningham RFC kept playing until 1903, when monetary troubles, brought about by transfer when the new century rolled over, provoked club authorities to change codes from rugby football to affiliation football. The main affiliation football match-up to be played at Valley Parade was a limited time installation on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The diversion had been sorted out to animate enthusiasm for the game in Bradford and pulled in 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were chosen to The Football League's Division Two the next month. Bradford City's first amusement at Valley Parade went ahead 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a horde of 11,000. Because of adjustments previously executed in 1897, City players initially changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting groups utilized the old rugby club changing areas at the back of the adjacent Belle Vue Hotel. Be that as it may, after City's 5Ã¢ÂÂ 1 annihilation by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was assaulted as he left the ground. Subsequently, The Football Association shut the ground for 14 days, requesting City to switch its changing rooms to the close-by Artillery Barracks for the 1906Ã¢ÂÂ 07 season. A few supporters confronted criminal procedures for the episode.
