The following types of "Stegosaurus" to be named was "S. marshi", by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas renamed this species in the new sort "Hoplitosaurus" soon thereafter. Lucas additionally rethought the issue of the existence appearance of "Stegosaurus", arriving at the resolution that the plates were organized in sets in two lines along the back, orchestrated over the bases of the ribs. Lucas authorized Charles R. Knight to deliver an actual existence reclamation of "S. ungulatus" in view of his new understanding. In any case, the next year, Lucas composed that he presently trusted the plates were presumably joined in stunned lines. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull composed that the rotating design found in "S. stenops" was likely because of moving of the skeleton after death. He drove the development of the first historically speaking "Stegosaurus" skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was delineated with combined plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore contended against Lull's translation, taking note of that few examples of "S. stenops", including the now-totally arranged holotype, saved the plates in substituting columns close to the pinnacle of the back, and that there was no proof of the plates having moved with respect to the body amid fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' elucidation turned into the for the most part acknowledged standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to mirror this in 1924.
