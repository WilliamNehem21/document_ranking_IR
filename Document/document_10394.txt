The idea for the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" arrangement started amid late advancement on "Conclusive Fantasy X-2" and the first "Kingdom Hearts". Examining what to do once "Last Fantasy XII" was finished, Nomura, Shinji Hashimoto and Yoshinori Kitase chose to expand upon the possibility of different diversions associated by a solitary "focal topic". Situation essayist Kazushige Nojima began composing the first folklore for the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" arrangement in 2003, completing it by February 2004. Nojima portrayed his creation as the consequence of a desire to make something totally new; a universe with its own mythos and legends. When he acquainted the idea with other colleagues, they preferred it and helped it develop. Similarly as with a portion of his different tasks, Nojima consolidated topics of folklore because of his preference for and broad research of Greek and Norse folklore. Amid his work, he got imaginative contribution from Kitase and Hashimoto, just as Nomura, Tabata and Motomu Toriyama. Nojima composed an arrangement book of scriptures about the folklore, clarifying ideas, for example, the fal'Cie and l'Cie and the sentiments of the divinities who made them. This book of scriptures turned into the reason for a video vivified by Yusuke Naora's specialty group to grandstand the mythos in 2011. None of the divinities were delineated in human structure in the video, as this would have undermined the engineers' desires for open elucidation by designers and players.
