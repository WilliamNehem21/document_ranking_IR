MacLean's was a moderately short forty minutes, in which he contended that the implausible and incredible nature of his customer's story was proof that she couldn't in any way, shape or form have created it. Ives at that point trained the attendants, and characterized "enchantment" as "initiating a lady to part with her uprightness ... [which] might be by any cunning gadget that realizes her assent."

As indicated by Ives, regardless of whether the realities had been actually as MacMillan had portrayed, as an issue of law the offended parties couldn't guarantee harms without a pregnancy or an ailment.
