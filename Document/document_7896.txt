Forests' greatest concern was about individuals. Troopers and researchers needed to come back to their peacetime interests, and there was a risk that wartime information would be lost, leaving nobody who realized how to deal with and keep up atomic weapons, considerably less how to improve the weapons and procedures. The military side of the Manhattan Project had depended vigorously on reservists, as the arrangement of the Corps of Engineers was to relegate normal officers to handle directions. The reservists were presently qualified for partition. To supplant them, Groves requested fifty West Point moves on from the main 10% of their classes to man bomb gathering groups at Sandia Base, where the get together staff and offices had been moved from Los Alamos and Wendover Field in September and October 1945. He felt that just such brilliant staff would probably work with the researchers who were right now carrying out the responsibility. They were likewise earnestly required for some different occupations in the after war Army. At the point when General Thomas T. Helpful turned down his solicitation, Groves raised the issue with the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who likewise did not favor it. Forests at that point went over his head as well, and took it to the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, who concurred with Groves. The faculty kept an eye on the 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special), which turned into a field unit under the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP).
