In spite of the fact that this model would in the long run be incredibly effective, Scientology was an exceptionally little scale development at first. Hubbard began off with just a couple of dozen supporters, by and large devoted Dianeticists; a seventy-hour arrangement of addresses in Philadelphia in December 1952 was gone to by only 38 individuals. Hubbard was participated in Phoenix by his 18-year-old child Nibs, who had been unfit to settle down in secondary school. Nibs had chosen to turn into a Scientologist, moved into his dad's home and proceeded to turn into a Scientology staff part and "educator". Hubbard likewise made a trip to the United Kingdom to build up his authority over a Dianetics aggregate in London. It was especially a shoestring activity; as Helen O'Brien later reviewed, "there was an air of extraordinary destitution and undercurrents of a horrid trick over all. At 163 Holland Park Avenue was an evil lit address room and an exposed boarded and poky office somewhere in the range of eight by ten feetÃ¢ÂÂchiefly swarmed by since quite a while ago haired men and short haired and shabby ladies." On September 24, 1952, just half a month in the wake of landing in London, Hubbard's significant other Mary Sue brought forth her first kid, a little girl whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.
