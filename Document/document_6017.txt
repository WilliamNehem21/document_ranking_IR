When he was two, the siblings were conveyed to England, where they were set under the consideration of an English babysitter in a house bordering that of Eleanor's dad and mom. The young men's folks came back to Hong Kong and ended up virtual outsiders to their children. Such a course of action was then typical for white collar class families situated in the states. The absence of parental contact, and the unforgiving routine of a portion of those "in loco parentis", left perpetual enthusiastic scars on numerous youngsters from comparative foundations, including the authors Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole.
