Toward the west of the structure is Willson Park, named for Salem author William H. Willson and sited generally at the focal point of his previous landholdings. From 1853 to 1965 it was a Salem city park. After the recreation center was swung over to the state, Lloyd Bond and Associates were approached to upgrade the recreation center. Willson Park has the Waite Fountain, a gazebo worked in 1982, and Peter Helzer's model, "A Parade of Animals" (1991), which was planned as a play structure. Waite Fountain was given out of appreciation for Oregon businessman E. M. Waite in 1907 by his better half. The Breyman Fountain, included 1904 as a dedication to Werner and Eugene Breyman, is at the far west end of the recreation center. It was initially enhanced with a statue of an officer from the SpanishÃ¢ÂÂ American War and furthermore filled in as a light post and steed trough. Today the statue holds no water and is now and again planted with blossoms. In 2005, a Walk of Flags highlight was included that shows the banners of each state in the Union. In 2009, the nine banners of Oregon's governmentally perceived Native American clans were added to the Walk of Flags.
