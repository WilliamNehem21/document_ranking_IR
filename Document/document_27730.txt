Newton had been a sergeant in his cadet corps at school, and joined the Citizens Military Force on 28Â November 1938, serving as a private in the machine-gun section of the 6th Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment. Still employed in the silk warehouse when World WarÂ II broke out in September 1939, he resigned to join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 5Â February 1940. He had earlier attempted to enlist when he turned eighteen in 1937, but his mother refused to give her permission; with Australia now at war, she acquiesced. His brothersâdentists by profession, like their fatherâalso enlisted in the armed forces, John as a surgeon lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy and Lindsay as a captain in the Army Medical Corps.
Newton undertook his initial training with No.Â 1 Elementary Flying Training School in Parafield, South Australia, flying De Havilland Tiger Moths, and with No.Â 21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, flying CAC Wirraways. He was awarded his wings and commissioned as a pilot officer on 28Â June 1940. Following advanced training on Avro Ansons with No.Â 1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook in September, he was selected to become a flight instructor. He completed the requisite course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales, and was promoted to flying officer on 28Â December. He subsequently began training students under the Empire Air Training Scheme at No.Â 2 Service Flying Training School near Wagga Wagga, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger.
