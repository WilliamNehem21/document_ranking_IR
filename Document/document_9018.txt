Columnists and fans have guessed about the effect a finished "X-treme" might have had available. David Houghton of GamesRadar depicted the possibility of "a great 3D "Sonic" diversion" on the Saturn as "a 'What if...' circumstance on a standard with the dinosaurs not getting to be terminated." IGN's Tavis Fahs called "X-treme" "the defining moment not just for Sega's mascot and their 32-bit reassure, however for the whole organization", yet noticed that the amusement filled in as "a vacant vessel for Sega's aspirations and the expectations of their fans". Dave Zdyrko, who worked an unmistakable Saturn fan site amid the framework's life expectancy, stated: "I don't have a clue if ["X-treme"] could've spared the Saturn, butÃÂ ... "Sonic" helped make the Genesis and it had neither rhyme nor reason why there was anything but an incredible new "Sonic" title prepared at or close to the dispatch of the [Saturn]". In a 2007 review, maker Mike Wallis kept up that "X-treme" "unquestionably would have been aggressive" with Nintendo's "Super Mario 64". On the other hand, "People to come" revealed in late 1996 that the amusement did not contrast well with contemporary challenge, and would have hurt Sega's notoriety on the off chance that it had been finished and discharged. Naka expressed that he was alleviated by the undoing, as the diversion "wasn't looking extremely great from my point of view".
