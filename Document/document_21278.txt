In 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, "The Throat of Winter", which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, "God of War III". Ãkerfeldt described the song as "odd" and "not very metal." To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called "Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology", from March 30 through April 9, 2010. "Blackwater Park" was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of April 5, 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled "In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall". The set was released on September 21, 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire "Blackwater Park" album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding "Blackwater Park", in chronological order representing the twenty years of "evolution" in their music. Ãkerfeldt stated, "I can't believe it, but, fuck, we're celebrating 20 years. I've been in this band ever since I was 16. It's insane." A special edition of "Blackwater Park" was released in March 2010 to coincide with the tour.
