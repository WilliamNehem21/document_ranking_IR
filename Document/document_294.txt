In late 1984 Chrisye moved toward another youthful writer, Adjie Soetama, to enable him to set up his next collection. Light beats and bright tunes were in vogue at the time; in this manner the two utilized a lighter style. Recording for the new collection, titled "Aku Cinta Dia" ("I Love Her"), started in 1985, with extra tunes from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The main melody was picked after Aciu heard a jam session driven by Adjie and quickly concluded that it would be the lead single. The collection called for all the more emoting, which ChrisyeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ known as having a solid stage personaÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ attempted to convey, however Yanti arranged vivid outfits and Alex Hasyim prepared him in movement. Upon its discharge, "Aku Cinta Dia" sold a huge number of duplicates in the main week and was inevitably confirmed gold. That equivalent year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama discharged "Hip Hura" ("Hip Hurray!"), and another coordinated effort, "Nona Lisa" ("Miss Lisa"), was discharged in 1986; the later two collections had comparative beats and rhythms and sold well, despite the fact that not just as "Aku Cinta Dia". On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second little girl, Risty Nurraisa.
