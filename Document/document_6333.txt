In Rhodesia, on the other hand, Lamb was after death held in exceptionally high respect by the men who had served close by him. His photo in full dress uniform was put on 3 Commando's Wall of Honor and stayed there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980. At the point when the narrative of his prior life in Canada was controlled by the "Rhodesia Herald", the paper got various emphatic letters from warriors who would not trust it. They requested a printed withdrawal and statement of regret, which the "Messenger" gave not long after to acquire any further embarrassment. The spear corporal was given what the "Windsor Star" and "Newsweek" both depicted as a "saint's memorial service" in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, on 15 November 1976. No individuals from his family were available. His pine box, hung in the Rhodesian banner and finished with an extensive bundle of roses, was carried on a firearm carriage to Warren Hills Cemetery, on the western edges of the city, where warriors of the RLI discharged three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the box was conveyed to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men. Sheep's cinders were a short time later come back to his relatives in Windsor, Ontario, where they were covered close by the remaining parts of his grandma.
