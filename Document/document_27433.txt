Before the mid-19th century, the subject of the nude male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting. Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art. Viewed in a broader context, "The Swimming Hole" has been cited as one of the few 19th-century American paintings that "engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition"âthat of the male bather. Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in "Summer Scene", Georges Seurat (1859â91) ("Bathers at AsniÃ¨res", 1884) and Paul CÃ©zanne (1839â1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject.
Eakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of American realists, particularly the artists of the Ashcan School. George Bellows' (1882â1925) "Forty-two Kids", painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to "The Swimming Hole", although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban Hudson River of New York City rather than in a rural setting. In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting "Forty-two Kids": "Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately."
