Researcher Lyman B. Hagen concurred and indicated out that Angelou had rethink her waiting partialities when looked with the more extensive world brimming with whites. The accounts she tells in "Singin' and Swingin"' contain "solid strong explanations that pass on immovably her resentment and wrath about dark relocation". For instance, when she wedded Tosh Angelos, against her mom's recommendation and wishes, she encountered negative responses from others. In spite of the fact that Tosh treated her and Guy well toward the start of their marriage, he immediately tired of their relationship and she felt objectified and sold out by another white man. Angelou moved between the white and Black universes, both characterizing herself as an individual from her locale and experiencing whites in "an a lot more full, increasingly sexy way". She depicted the pressure she encountered, as a Black female performer, working in the white-commanded universe of the 1950s. Her impression of connections among Blacks and whites must be continually adjusted, in spite of the dispositions and thoughts regarding whites she gained from her mom and grandma. Angelou's sentiments about race and bigotry were irresolute, despite the fact that the majority of her encounters with whites were certain amid this time.
