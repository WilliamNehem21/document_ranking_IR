Debbage remarks, "One quality of Bradley Joseph as a craftsman has been his sharp capacity to compose rousing music with fittingly titled tunes that express that idea non-verbally". Joseph disclosed to Janus that, "Through instrumental music, I'm permitted to think of melodic thoughts that enable the audience to make their own impression of my tune. On the off chance that you include verses about a young lady in the melody, the audience doesn't have a decision of what the tune is about, it's advised to them. My melodic works enable me to express anything. It's simpler for me to recount to an account of something I've experienced along these lines than to verbalize it. Furthermore, my sentiments are investigated more in my structures contrasted with what I would ever say in a couple of sentences." He trusts that "music enables an individual to express their most profound contemplations, musings that can't be communicated with just words." He additionally trusts that the otherworldly part of making is to "discover something profound inside yourself that must be made by you"..."Your profound self can't be duplicated and that is the reason it's so noteworthy throughout everyday life and music", he says. Parsons proceeds to state, "The impact of long periods of visiting with Yanni is evident in the extravagance of Joseph's sound, however his melodic voice is his own." Yanni once stated, "Bradley, your extraordinary affectability is your most prominent blessing". Joseph later acknowledged what Yanni implied was that he required that as an author, that it was a vital part "to be delicate to what you see and to have the capacity to apply that to music".
