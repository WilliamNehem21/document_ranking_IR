In 1929 Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy, Lieutenant Richard Manners in "Song of the Sea", and later that year he performed in the revue "Coo-ee", with Billy Bennett, Dorothy Dickson and Claude Hulbert. When "The Co-Optimists" re-formed in 1930, he rejoined that company, now at the Savoy Theatre, and at the same venue appeared in "Savoy Follies" in 1931, where he introduced to London audiences the monologue "The Lion and Albert". The monologue was written by Marriott Edgar, who based the story on a news item about a boy who was eaten by a lion in the zoo. In the monologue, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom react in a measured way when their son Albert is swallowed. Neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed, but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it. It was well received, and Holloway introduced it into his stage act. Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, "The Times" wrote that Sam and Albert "became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War." These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called "the understated look-on-the-bright-side world of the cockney working class. ... Holloway's characters are [mischievous, like Albert, or] obstinate, and hilariously clueless. He often told his stories in costume; sporting outrageous attire and bushy moustaches." In 1932 Harry S. Pepper, with Holloway and others, revived the White Coons Concert Party show for BBC Radio.
