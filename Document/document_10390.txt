Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in the bishopric of Lincoln by September 1171, and presumably held that office until he was affirmed as cleric choose in 1175. He likewise held a prebend, a pay from land possessed by a house of prayer part, in the see of London, however there is little proof that he executed the obligations of either office. There are a few signs that he contemplated ordinance law at a school in Northampton, and that he educated in Paris amid the mid 1170s. He likewise went about as an ecclesiastical judge-delegate around then. Pope Alexander III at first would not affirm Geoffrey's choice as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, inciting Geoffrey to make a trip to Rome in October 1174 to verify affirmation of this office. He was affirmed in the workplace of religious administrator by July 1175, however he was not appointed around then, as he was under the accepted age for holding a ministerial office. Geoffrey's childhood was one of Alexander's protests to Geoffrey's decision, and the pope just affirmed the workplace under coercion. Another potential issue was Geoffrey's wrongness, which ordinarily disbarred an individual from holding clerical office, however that was managed by the giving of an ecclesiastical allotment.
