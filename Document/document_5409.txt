Hanna made discourses over the state, a lot to the interest of Ohioans, who had heard a lot about him for his exercises for the benefit of McKinley, yet who did not realize him well. He had once in a while been called upon to make open locations. McKinley suggested his own method of altogether spreading out a discourse ahead of time, however Hanna discovered it didn't function admirably for him. Rather, he wanted to form a short presentation and after that talk on the spur of the moment, not in every case notwithstanding being sure of what points he would address. As indicated by his biographer, Herbert Croly, the casualness of Hanna's discourses prevailed upon numerous in his group of onlookers, and he wound up known as an exceptionally successful open speaker. As indicated by Philip Warken in his proposal on the 1898 Senate decision, "The crusade likely attempted further bolstering Hanna's good fortune. The shadowy figure out of sight took on shape and structure, the applicant's open appearances tending to separate [Davenport's] prevalent yet contorted picture of him." When Democrats assaulted Hanna, who had extensive budgetary interests in industry, as a "work smasher", he gave addresses welcoming audience members to ask his specialists whether they were all around treated. In this way, a few association pioneers and laborers' boards affirmed that they had no objection against Hanna.
