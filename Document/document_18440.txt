Other reviews were more negative. "GameSpot" writer Jeff Sengstack said the expensive budget and long production history "do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered "[the game] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame". Mike Hall of the "Albuquerque Journal" compared "Phantasmagoria" to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like "Cleopatra" and "Waterworld". He said the graphics were beautiful, but the game ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. "The Escapist" writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were "ordinary, pixilated fare" was "odd and unflattering". A one-star review in "The Video Games Guide", published in 2013, "now seems little more than a flawed, though ambitious, white elephant". In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that "Phantasmagoria" wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content for the end of the game. But he said it was ultimately "less a bad game than a bad horror film" and said the execution, "although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices".
