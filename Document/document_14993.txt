The project was at this point named "AlÃ³ Presidente", a working title taken from ChÃ¡vez's weekly television and radio program. BSÃ set about exploring avenues of funding; the organization persuaded Bartley and ÃÂ Briain to make a short pilot to show to potential investors, but refused the filmmakers' application for a â¬60,000 grant towards their â¬131,000 production budget. BSÃ felt the pair needed to partner with a production company that had experience in the field, and which could help raise the remaining funds. Bartley and ÃÂ Briain approached Power Pictures and, with the addition of David Power as a producer, reapplied for the grant. Even as filming began, the full budgetânow at â¬200,000âhad not been secured. David Power pitched the project at several documentary festivals and markets. At Dublin's Stranger Than Fiction festival in September 2001, the BBC, S4C and Channel 4 declined to invest. RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann (RTÃ) expressed interest in providing development funds; no such deal was made, but RTÃ did offer â¬10,000 (subsequently â¬20,000) for the Irish broadcast rights. In October, the Dutch broadcaster Nederlandse Programma Stichting also committed â¬10,000. At a November market in Amsterdam, Power once again approached the BBC and was turned down, as the organization believed the film's subject was "too far away to be relevant to [its viewers'] lives". However, RTÃ's Kevin Dawson pushed the film at a European Broadcasting Union pitching session, securing the interest of German television channel ZDF, which subsequently provided funds. In late 2001, BSÃ finally approved a production grant of â¬63,000.
