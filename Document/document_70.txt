In the event that he thought at all about his conceivable uprooting by the new development in the New York workmanship world, he didn't demonstrate it. In a meeting he gave at the time he got the honor he made no objection about the dissent yet just recommended that the specialists may have presented their work to the jury and challenged just in the event that it were not acknowledged. In another meeting, given two years after the fact, he stated, gently, that such a large number of specialists "aren't willing to work for the last concordance of connections." He trusted they worked too rapidly and did not have a propensity for basic reflection. On their part the theoretical expressionists appear not to have stereotyped Knaths' work as staid and preservationist. Barnett Newman, one of the men who marked the 1950 dissent letter, felt that it resembled crafted by Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko in having a power of inclination and passionate effect. Of the three he stated "These craftsmen are doing what appears to be incomprehensible, communicating sentiments and musings with theoretical structures and level space." There remained a magnificent market for Knaths' compositions amid an amazing rest and, at his demise, the works left in his domain directed moderately high costs.
