"Jaws" received mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" called it "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings". "Variety"'s A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance "absolutely magnificent". According to "The New Yorker"s Pauline Kael, it was "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever madeÂ ... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For "New Times" magazine, Frank Rich wrote, "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.Â ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in "Jaws" are those where we don't even see the shark." Writing for "New York" magazine, Judith Crist described the film as "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" and complimented its acting and "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the "nerve-frying" action scenes and concluded that "for the most part, "Jaws" is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".
