The Amalthea gossamer ring is an extremely black out structure with a rectangular cross segment, extending from the circle of Amalthea at (2.54 "R") to about (). Its internal limit isn't obviously characterized a result of the nearness of the a lot more brilliant principle ring and radiance. The thickness of the ring is around 2300ÃÂ km close to the circle of Amalthea and marginally diminishes toward Jupiter. The Amalthea gossamer ring is really the most brilliant close to its top and base edges and turns out to be steadily more brilliant towards Jupiter; one of the edges is regularly more brilliant than another. The external limit of the ring is generally steep; the ring's brilliance drops unexpectedly only internal of the circle of Amalthea, despite the fact that it might have a little augmentation past the circle of the satellite consummation close 4:3 reverberation with Thebe. In forward-dispersed light the ring gives off an impression of being around multiple times fainter than the primary ring. In back-dispersed light it has been recognized just by the Keck telescope and the ACS (Advanced Camera for Surveys) on HST. Back-dissipating pictures demonstrate extra structure in the ring: a crest in the splendor simply inside the Amalthean circle and restricted to the top or base edge of the ring.
