Agents of the ACS were available at the October 1970 devotion of the house as an exhibition hall. On April 25, 1974 around 400 physicists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the most elevated and most seasoned respect granted by the ACS, was granted to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A copy of the Priestley Medal is in plain view at the house.) On August 1, 1974Ã¢ÂÂwhat has been marked the bicentennial of the revelation of oxygenÃ¢ÂÂmore than 500 scientific experts going to the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at State College headed out to the house to observe "Oxygen Day". In October 1976, the ACS praised its own centennial with a festival in Northumberland. A 100 or more piece reproduction of Priestley's research center hardware, made by colleges, companies, and the Smithsonian Institution, was introduced to the house for showcase. On April 13, 1983, ACS President Fred Basolo talked at the house to observe Priestley's 250th birthday celebration and as a major aspect of a first day of issue function for the United States Postal Service's Joseph Priestley memorial stamp. In 2001 the ACS again met at the house to praise the 125th commemoration of the general public, and reenacted portions of the 1874 and 1926 festivals, including a walk to Priestley's grave, at which every member left a red rose.
