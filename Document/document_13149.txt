Zeta-Jones came back to arrange in 2009 with a recovery of the melodic "A Little Night Music", which denoted her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden amid the mid twentieth century, the melodic pursues the connection between three individuals (Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) over the span of a night. She played DesirÃÂ©e Armfeldt, a maturing on-screen character, and was especially attracted to the complexities of the play, saying, "There's no energetic hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,ÃÂ ... It's not one of those shows where you can burrow around three inches and turn out the opposite end. You can continue burrowing and burrowing and burrowing". She didn't tune in to past accounts of the tunes in the play so she could convey her own elucidation to them. The commentator Claire Prentice of "The Daily Telegraph" composed that Zeta-Jones acquired a "peaceful, intelligent power" in her interpretation of the tune "Send in the Clowns", yet Emma Brocks of "The Guardian" was increasingly basic, commenting that "with her pretty voice, head wresting along these lines and that, [she] is by all accounts trying out for stage school". For her execution, Zeta-Jones won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.
