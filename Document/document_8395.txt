Walton's next real creation was the monstrous choral cantata "Belshazzar's Feast" (1931). It started as a work on an unassuming scale; the BBC charged a piece for little tune, ensemble of close to fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell built a content, choosing sections from a few books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. As Walton took a shot at it, he found that his music required far bigger powers than the BBC proposed to permit, and Beecham saved him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival, to be led by Malcolm Sargent. Walton later reviewed Beecham as saying, "As you'll never hear the work again, my kid, why not toss in several metal groups?" During early practices, the Leeds ensemble individuals discovered Walton's music hard to ace, and it was erroneously supposed in London melodic circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to suppress a revolt. The primary execution was a triumph for the arranger, conductor and entertainers. A contemporary faultfinder expressed, "The individuals who encountered the gigantic effect of its first execution had full defense for inclination that an incredible arranger had emerged in our property, an author to whose possibilities it was difficult to set any limits." The work has remained a staple of the choral collection.
