Hoult next showed up in Tom Ford's "A Single Man" (2009), after the performing artist initially cast in the job of Kenny Potter left the film a couple of days before taping started. Hoult had recently appeared in the task and had sent a recorded tryout tape; he was in the long run picked for the job of Kenny, a gay undergrad who helps a school teacher, played by Colin Firth, manage his pain. "A Single Man" was differently depicted by news sources as the main grown-up job for Hoult, who portrayed Kenny as an "unconstrained" character not just characterized by his sexuality. Since the job was his first as an American character, Hoult chipped away at his intonation; Sukhdev Sandhu of "The Daily Telegraph" noticed Ford's decision of giving British on-screen characters a role as Americans (Hoult and Matthew Goode) and the other way around (Julianne Moore). "A Single Man" opened to boundless recognition in spite of reservations from faultfinders about Ford's directorial capacities; it was a film industry achievement. The film earned Hoult an assignment for the BAFTA Rising Star Award at the 2010 function; Kristen Stewart won the honor. In 2010, Hoult voiced the character of Elliot in Lionhead Studios' activity pretending diversion "Tale III" (2010).
