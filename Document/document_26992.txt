The early 1960s were a turbulent period for the NOI; unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders Elijah Muhammad and MalcolmÂ X. Around that time, ClarenceÂ 13X became disenchanted with the organization, although the root of his qualms is not known. NOI members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily. His departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the NOI's theology, violations of their moral code, objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership, or MalcolmÂ X's distrust of him. Dora Smith elected to stay with the group, prompting the couple's separation. Before leaving the NOI, ClarenceÂ 13X had begun to doubt their teaching that Wallace Fard Muhammad was a divine messenger. He believed that the NOI's teachings were contradictory because they taught that God is black but encouraged reverence of Fard Muhammad, who was not of exclusively African descent. ClarenceÂ 13X concluded that divinity was found in all black men, rather than in a single person. Several times before he left the NOI, he was censured by leadership for these assertions. His friend JohnÂ 37X elected to leave with him. MalcolmÂ X also left the NOI in 1963 and remained on good terms with ClarenceÂ 13X. ClarenceÂ 13X did not join MalcolmÂ X's newly created group, Muslim Mosque, Inc.
