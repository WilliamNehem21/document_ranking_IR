The assault astonished American authorities and policymakers on Vietnam, who were sure that the South Vietnamese government was in charge in Saigon and that the Vietcong were just a risk in provincial regions. The South Vietnamese government was flimsy, as it was the most recent in a progression of military juntas that had ruled for brief periods before being dismissed. The infighting exasperated Maxwell Taylor, the US envoy to South Vietnam and previous Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who felt that the debate between the junta's senior officers were wrecking the war exertion. Under about fourteen days before the shelling, the commanders had broken down the High National Council, a non military personnel warning body, provoking Taylor to call the commanders to his office. The represetative at that point indignantly upbraided the officers, and the following day prompted General Nguyen Khanh, the president, to leave and go into outcast, as he had lost Taylor's certainty. Khanh took steps to remove Taylor, who said that his constrained takeoff would mean the finish of US support for South Vietnam. On DecemberÃÂ 22, Khanh reported on Radio Vietnam that "We make penances for the nation's autonomy and the Vietnamese individuals' freedom, yet not to complete the approach of any outside nation". Khanh unequivocally condemned Taylor in a meeting distributed in the "New York Herald Tribune" on DecemberÃÂ 23, and upon the arrival of the bombarding, he issued an affirmation of autonomy from "remote control". At the time, Khanh was additionally subtly consulting with the socialists, wanting to assemble a harmony bargain so he could oust the Americans from Vietnam. Thus, there was a doubt among a minority that Khanh and his officers had been behind the assault, despite the fact that the Vietcong had guaranteed duty through a radio communicate.
