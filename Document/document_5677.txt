As indicated by the ordnance officer Anders Gyllenspak, just 40 men, including himself, endure the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 mariners and 22 fighters, which implies that more than 800 had died. Among them were about six naval force and armed force officers just as the main doctor of the Admiralty and the armada pharmacist. Inside and out around 1,400 men kicked the bucket when "Kronan" and "SvÃÂ¤rdet" were lost, and in the days following the fight, several carcasses were appeared on the east bank of ÃÂland. As per the vicar of LÃÂ¥nglÃÂ¶t ward, 183 men were taken from the shorelines and covered at Hulterstad and StenÃÂ¥sa memorial parks. Lorentz Creutz's body was recognized and transported to his domain Sarvlax close to the town of Loviisa, Finland, where it was covered. The misfortunes were far and away more terrible since "Kronan" was the lead and was kept an eye on with the best mariners and heavy weapons specialists in the armada. Whenever "Kronan" and "SvÃÂ¤rdet" went down, they took with them the naval force's whole supply of 30-and 36-pounder firearms. By and large over 300ÃÂ tonnes of bronze weapons worth about 250,000 silver dalers ran down with the boats, an aggregate that was marginally higher than the estimation of the boats themselves.
