Murphy starred as Patrick/"Kitten" Braden, a transgender Irish woman in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan's comedy-drama "Breakfast on Pluto" (2005), based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film's kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red-light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high drag blond bombshell. He had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of "The Crying Game" was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. The role required "serious primping" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal, and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character with a "bemused and hopeful voice". While even lukewarm reviews of "Breakfast on Pluto" still tended to praise Murphy's performance highly, a few critics dissented: "The Village Voice", which panned the film, found him "unconvincing" and overly cute.
Murphy was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for "Breakfast on Pluto" and won the fourth Irish Film and Television Academy Best Actor Award. "Premiere" cited his performance as Kitten in their "The 24 Finest Performances of 2005" feature.
