Arranger Tim Larkin, a sound creator and sound executive at Cyan who had recently chipped away at "realMyst" and "", was given the assignment of creating "Myst V"s melodic score. Larkin expressed that while before "Myst" amusements had been compelled by innovative confinements, the accessible innovation permitted "End of Ages" to have a progressively powerful condition, with the music changing with different timings of various audio cues. Encompass sound gave an increasingly reasonable and vivid interactivity experience. A noteworthy test recorded as a hard copy the music was that the score must be sufficiently adaptable to coordinate the non-direct interactivity occasions. "Amusements are absolutely intelligent encounters," Larkin clarified. "You don't direct a player through, since you can't rely on being at a specific spot at a specific time. I can't compose signal music to get the player to do this, this and after that this. One player may hear the prompt and run the other way!" Larkin needed to step far from what he had realized as a jazz author and performer composing pieces with a clear start and end, rather making music with "less circular segment" and structure. Larkin conceded that some "Myst" fans would have favored a melodic style like Robyn Miller's scores for "Myst" and "Riven", however answered by saying that change occurs and players would discover something to like in the new music on the off chance that they kept a receptive outlook.
