Zwingli was appointed in Constance, the seat of the neighborhood bishopric, and he praised his first Mass in the place where he grew up, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a youthful cleric he had contemplated little religious philosophy, yet this was not viewed as surprising at the time. His first religious post was the pastorate of the town of Glarus, where he remained for a long time. It was in Glarus, whose fighters were utilized as hired soldiers in Europe, that Zwingli wound up engaged with governmental issues. The Swiss Confederation was entangled in different crusades with its neighbors: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli set himself positively in favor of the Roman See. Consequently, Pope Julius II respected Zwingli by giving him a yearly annuity. He played the job of pastor in a few crusades in Italy, including the Battle of Novara in 1513. In any case, the unequivocal thrashing of the Swiss in the Battle of Marignano caused a move in temperament in Glarus for the French as opposed to the pope. Zwingli, the ecclesiastical divided, ended up in a troublesome position and he chose to withdraw to Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. At this point, he had turned out to be persuaded that soldier of fortune administration was corrupt and that Swiss solidarity was key for any future accomplishments. A portion of his most punctual surviving compositions, for example, "The Ox" (1510) and "The Labyrinth" (1516), assaulted the soldier of fortune framework utilizing purposeful anecdote and parody. His compatriots were displayed as ethical individuals inside a French, majestic, and ecclesiastical triangle. Zwingli remained in Einsiedeln for a long time amid which he pulled back totally from governmental issues for clerical exercises and individual investigations.
