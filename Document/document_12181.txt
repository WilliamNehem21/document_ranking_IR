In 1986, Charig and Milner named another family and species with the skeleton as holotype example: "Baryonyx walkeri". The nonexclusive name gets from old Greek; ÃÂ²ÃÂ±ÃÂÃÂÃÂ ("barys") signifies "substantial" or "solid", and Ã¡Â½ÂÃÂ½ÃÂÃÂ¾ ("onyx") signifies "hook" or "claw". The particular name praises Walker, for finding the example. Around then, the creators did not know whether the expansive hook had a place with the hand or the foot (as in dromaeosaurs, which it was then thought to be). The dinosaur had been exhibited before that year amid an address at a meeting about dinosaur systematics in Drumheller. Because of continuous work on the bones (70 percent had been set up at the time), they called their article primer and guaranteed a progressively point by point portrayal sometime in the not too distant future. "Baryonyx" was the principal huge Early Cretaceous theropod found anyplace on the planet at that point. Before the revelation of "Baryonyx" the last huge theropod find in the United Kingdom was "Eustreptospondylus" in 1871, and in a 1986 meeting Charig called "Baryonyx" "the best find of the century" in Europe. "Baryonyx" was broadly included in worldwide media, and was nicknamed "Hooks" by writers punning on the title of the film "Jaws". Its disclosure was the subject of a 1987 BBC narrative, and a cast of the skeleton is mounted at the Natural History Museum in London. In 1997, Charig and Milner distributed a monograph depicting the holotype skeleton in detail. The holotype example remains the most totally known spinosaurid skeleton.
