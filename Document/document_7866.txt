McKinley was killed in September 1901, and was prevailing by Theodore Roosevelt. Taft and Roosevelt had first progressed toward becoming companions around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt an individual from the Civil Service Commission. Taft had, after McKinley's decision, encouraged the arrangement of Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and looked as Roosevelt turned into a war saint, Governor of New York, and Vice President of the United States. They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recover after two activities brought about by a disease. There, Taft affirmed before the Senate Committee on the Philippines. Taft needed Filipino ranchers to have a stake in the new government through land proprietorship, however a significant part of the arable land was held by Catholic religious requests of for the most part Spanish ministers, which were frequently loathed by the Filipinos. Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to consult with Pope Leo XIII, to buy the grounds and to organize the withdrawal of the Spanish clerics, with Americans supplanting them and preparing local people as church. Taft did not prevail with regards to settling these issues on his visit to Rome, yet a concession to the two points was made in 1903.
