His show visits frequently highlighted other major leaguers and Negro League players, similar to Satchel Paige, who was likewise a colleague of Feller's with the Indians. Different players included Stan Musial, Mickey Vernon, and Jeff Heath. Amid a traveling visit in 1945, Feller pitched against Jackie Robinson after he had been marked by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He told a correspondent in Los Angeles he trusted Robinson was too muscle-bound to prevail against contributing the significant classes despite the fact that Robinson recorded two hits off Feller. Players needed to tell the Commissioner of Baseball, A.B. "Cheerful" Chandler, before taking an interest in presentation diversions and were not permitted to start recreations before the finish of the real alliance season. Feller kept in touch with Chandler, testing as far as possible on the quantity of diversions that were permitted to be played and proposing an expansion; the Commissioner consented to Feller's proposition. To limit travel time, Feller utilized planes, for example, two DC-3s of every 1947, to transport players from town to town. Feller's contribution, just as that of other real group players, was the subject of gatherings between the Commissioner and AL and NL presidents.
