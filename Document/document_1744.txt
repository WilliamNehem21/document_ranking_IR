She asserted that the clique had "all around likely" once been dedicated to the love of both a male god and a "Mother Goddess" however that "when the religion is recorded the love of the male divinity seems to have supplanted that of the female". In her contention, Murray guaranteed that the figure alluded to as the Devil in the preliminary records was the witches' god, "show and manifest", to whom the witches offered their supplications. She guaranteed that at the witches' gatherings, the god would be embodied, as a rule by a man or now and again by a lady or a creature; when a human represented this substance, Murray asserted that they were normally dressed doubtlessly, however they showed up in full ensemble for the witches' Sabbaths.
