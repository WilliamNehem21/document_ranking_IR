Floodlights were introduced at an expense of ÃÂ£12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were exchanged on out of the blue for a match against Everton to recognize the 75-year commemoration of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was supplanted by a cantilevered stand, worked at an expense of ÃÂ£350,000, obliging 6,700 onlookers. After two years changes were made at the Anfield Road end, transforming it into a bigger secured standing territory with refreshments under the structure. The greatest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was incompletely devastated and broadened in reverse with new rooftop. All the while the solid arch floodlights were decimated with new lights introduced along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was formally opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. During the 1980s the enclosure before the Main Stand was transformed into seating, and in 1982 seats were presented at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were raised in 1982, a tribute to previous director Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie opened them out of the blue on 26 August 1982. Over the Shankly Gates are the words "You'll Never Walk Alone", the title of the hit tune by Gerry and the Pacemakers received by Liverpool fans as the club's song of devotion amid Shankly's time as chief.
