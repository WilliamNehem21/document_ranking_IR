While moored in CÃÂ¡diz, the boats met the four "Brandenburg"- class ships, which were coming back from their campaign to smother the Boxer Rebellion in China. From 22 August to 21 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" took an interest in the yearly pre-winter moves of the whole armada. While in the Danzig Bay, the armada led a maritime survey for the meeting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, whose spouse Alexandra was Wilhelm's cousin.

The boats at that point partook in another preparation journey to Norway in July and afterward the pre-winter moves, which started in the Baltic and deduced in the North Sea with an armada audit in the Jade. Amid the activity, which kept going from 17 August to 18 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and the remainder of I Squadron were alloted to assume the jobs of both the German armada and threatening powers.
