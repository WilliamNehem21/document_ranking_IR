At the point when Baldwin landed at Acre on 12 October 1190, the Muslim powers in the city were under attack by the Frankish powers driven by King Guy of Lusignan and Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem, who thus were being blockaded by Saladin. Not long after Baldwin's landing, there was a progression emergency in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Sibylla, a first cousin of Henry II, and her two youthful little girls all kicked the bucket in July from a pandemic attacking the attack camp where they were living. This left Guy without a lawful case to the kingdom as he had held the authority through his significant other. The beneficiary to the kingdom was Sibylla's stepsister Isabella; she was at that point hitched to Humphrey IV of Toron, yet he was faithful to Guy and appears to have had no aspiration to be best. An all the more encouraging contender for the royal position was Conrad of Montferrat, uncle of the last undisputed ruler, Baldwin V. Conrad had spared the kingdom from annihilation by driving the effective safeguard of Tire, and had the help of Isabella's mom Maria Comnena and stepfather Balian of Ibelin. Maria and Balian snatched Isabella from Humphrey, and constrained her to look for a dissolution, with the goal that she could be hitched to Conrad and empower him to guarantee the sovereignty.
