Punk continued to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual Royal Rumble match in January 2010 as well as during an Elimination Chamber match in February 2010 at both of the eponymous pay-per-view events. In the Elimination Chamber match, Punk was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the event. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a street fight at WrestleMania XXVI, but he lost to Gallows and Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost against him at WrestleMania XXVI, he would join the Straight Edge Society. At the event on March 28, Punk lost to Mysterio, sparking a rematch on April 25 at Extreme Rules where Punk would have to shave his head like his disciples if he lost, but he won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Straight Edge Society who kept his face covered. On May 23 at Over The Limit, a third and final match between Punk and Mysterio was booked with both stipulations reactivated, but he lost and was subsequently shaved bald.
