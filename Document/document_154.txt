Recorded instances of grave theft for medicinal purposes can be found as far back as 1319. The fifteenth century polymath Leonardo da Vinci may have furtively analyzed around 30ÃÂ corpses, despite the fact that their provenance stays obscure. In Britain, the training seems to have been regular right off the bat in the seventeenth century. For instance, William Shakespeare's memorial peruses "Great companion, for the wellbeing of Jesus abstain, To burrow the residue encased here. Favored be the man that saves these stones, And reviled be he that moves my bones" and in 1678, anatomists were associated with being engaged with the vanishing of an executed wanderer's body.

Students went with expert body snatchers as onlookers, and were accounted for to have acquired and paid for their investigations with human carcasses, maybe showing that their guides were complicit. The unapproved expulsion of bodies from London memorial parks ended up typical and by the 1720s, most likely as an immediate consequence of the absence of legitimately accessible bodies for anatomical research, crisp bodies had likely experienced commodification.
