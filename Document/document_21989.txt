"" (literally: sound, you songs) is a festive concerto, marked by Bach. Words and music are possibly based on an earlier lost secular (congratulatory cantata). A printing of Franck's works contains a cantata for New Year's Day, (Sound again, congratulating songs) that may have served as a model. The movement is in "da capo" form: the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section. It is scored for three "choirs": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-part chorus. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, appears again in the 3/8 time signature and in the use of three trumpets. The first part opens with trumpet fanfares, alternating with flowing coloraturas in the strings. The voices enter as a third homophonic choir. They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word "Erschallet" (resound!), as the trumpets echo the motif. The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on "ihr Lieder", and the trumpets echo it again. The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on "erklinget, ihr Saiten", commanding the strings to play. As a culmination, the first syllable of "" (most blessed times) is held on a seventh chord (first in measure 53), during which the instruments play their motifs.
