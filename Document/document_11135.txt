Regardless of his basic remarks, Thucydides concedes in a short straying that "freely his lead of the war was comparable to could be wanted". Diodorus and Demosthenes see him as an incredible general. As per Fotiadis, Alcibiades was a powerful broad and, wherever he went, triumph tailed him; had he driven the military in Sicily, the Athenians would have kept away from fiasco and, had his compatriots pursued his recommendation at Aegospotami, Lysander would have lost and Athens would have ruled Greece. Then again, Paparrigopoulos trusts that the Sicilian Expedition, incited by Alcibiades, was a key error. In concurrence with Paparrigopoulos, Platias and Koliopoulos underscore the way that the Sicilian campaign was a key screw up of the main greatness, coming about because of a "pointless disposition and an inconceivable underestimation of the foe". As far as it matters for him, Angelos Vlachos, a Greek Academician, underlines the steady enthusiasm of Athens for Sicily from the earliest starting point of the war. As indicated by Vlachos, the endeavor had nothing of the indulgent or daring and comprised a judicious key choice dependent on customary Athenian yearnings. Vlachos attests that Alcibiades had just considered a more extensive arrangement: the triumph of the entire West. He proposed to overcome Carthage and Libya, at that point to assault Italy and, in the wake of winning these, to catch Italy and Peloponnesus. The underlying choice of the ecclesia gave anyway to a sensible military power, which later turned out to be irrationally extensive and exorbitant as a result of Nicias' requests. Kagan scrutinizes Alcibiades for neglecting to perceive that the extensive size of the Athenian undertaking undermined the political plan on which his procedure rested.
