Tom Hall chose the "Quake" engine for "Anachronox"; its developer John Carmack took interest in its use for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited "Chrono Trigger" as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the "Final Fantasy" series and "Ultima III". As in "Chrono Trigger", battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, "if there's a dragon guarding a door, I want the chance to say, 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where the hell was "that"?!?'" The team expanded the "Final Fantasy"-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for "Anachronox" in mid-2000: "In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also a big fan of Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: "Gateway", "Ender's Game", "Snow Crash", "Hitchhiker's", so many more. Games: "Chrono Trigger", "Final Fantasy", LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), "Ape Escape" (buy it now), "Mario", "Ultima III", "Wizardry I", oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in "Chrono Trigger" in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.
