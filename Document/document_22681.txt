After the strike force was recovered, much of the Home Fleet sailed away from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A group comprising "Formidable", "Furious", two cruisers and several destroyers set a course for the two fleet oilers, and the escort carrier group withdrew so that the carriers could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, "Nabob" was struck by a torpedo fired from "U-354". The carrier suffered serious damage and 21 fatalities but was able to continue limited flight operations. Shortly afterwards "U-354" torpedoed the frigate as the latter searched for "Nabob"s attacker. "Nabob" was forced to return to the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow that evening, escorted by "Trumpeter", a cruiser and several destroyers. "Formidable" and "Furious" covered their withdrawal; during this period "Furious" also refuelled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The departure of both escort carriers meant that the mine-dropping component of Operation Goodwood had to be cancelled. "Bickerton"s stern was wrecked by the torpedo, and she could have potentially been salvaged. However, the force's commander did not want to have to protect two crippled ships, and the frigate was scuttled at around 8:30 pm on 22 August. Shortly after the attacks on "Nabob" and "Bickerton", Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German Blohm & Voss BV 138 reconnaissance aircraft.
