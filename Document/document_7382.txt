Every offense would confront intense resistance noticeable all around and on the ground. The Virginia Tech guard, driven by junior linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi, was required to exhibit a test for the Georgia offense. "You endeavor to locate some sort of confound, yet it's hard to do", Georgia head mentor Mark Richt said before kickoff. "That is for what reason they're the best (resistance) in the nation. Their inside guarded linemen are, extremely solid and physical, and, truly, every other person is worked for speed. Their edge rushers are huge, and their linebackers are extraordinary and physical. Their protective backs would all be able to run and hit. It will be a genuine test." Of specific worry for quarterback Matt Stafford were Virginia Tech's cornerbacks, whom he would need to experience so as to finish goes to his beneficiaries. "They play sort of an unexpected plan in comparison to a ton of groups so it would be extreme on the off chance that you just had multi week to attempt to get ready for these folks", Stafford said in a meeting preceding the diversion. "They trust their corners a great deal, however they have great ones and can. They lock up a ton of time single beneficiary side since they have a decent corner down there that plays on the limit."
