In 1924, the American scientist Charles W. Gilmore depicted a total skull of "S. validus" with related postcranial remains (example UALVP 2 in the University of Alberta Laboratory for Vertebrate Paleontology), up to that point the most total survives from a vault headed dinosaur. This find affirmed Hatcher's understanding of the vaults as comprising of the frontoparietal territory of the skull. UALVP 2 was found with little, disarticulated hard components, at that point thought to be gastralia (stomach ribs), which are not known in other ornithischian dinosaurs (one of the two fundamental gatherings of dinosaurs). Gilmore brought up that the teeth of "S. validus" were fundamentally the same as those of the species "Troodon formosus" (named in 1856 and by then just known from confined teeth), and portrayed a skull arch found near the territory where "Troodon" was found. Hence, Gilmore considered "Stegoceras" an invalid junior equivalent word of "Troodon", in this way renaming "S. validus" into "T. validus", and recommended that even the two species may be the equivalent. Moreover, he discovered "S. brevis" to be indistinguishable to "S. validus", and along these lines a lesser equivalent word of the last mentioned. He additionally put these species in the new family Troodontidae (since Lambe had not chosen a sort class for his Psalisauridae), which he thought about nearest to the ornithopod dinosaurs. Since the skull appeared to be so particular contrasted with the fairly "crude"- looking skeleton, Nopcsa questioned whether these parts really had a place together, and recommended the skull had a place with a nodosaur, the skeleton to an ornithopod, and the alleged gastralia (paunch ribs) to a fish. This case was disproved by Gilmore and Loris S. Russell during the 1930s.
