Joyce shared Yeats' view that Ireland's relationship with England was a basic component in a mutual history, and asked: "Disclose to me why you think I should change the conditions that gave Ireland and me a shape and a fate?" Oliver St. John Gogarty, in his artistic diary "As I Was Going Down Sackville Street", considers the Pillar "the most stupendous thing we have in Dublin", where "the statue in more white stone looked perpetually south towards Trafalgar and the Nile". That Pillar, says Gogarty, "marks the finish of a human progress, the summit of the extraordinary time of eighteenth century Dublin". Yeats' 1927 ballad "The Three Monuments" has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell on their separate landmarks, ridiculing Ireland's post-freedom pioneers for their inflexible profound quality and absence of bravery, the front of the characteristics of the "three old rascals".<br>A later author, Brendan Behan, in his "Admissions of an Irish Rebel" (1965) composed from a Fenian point of view that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor viewed the Pillar as "a scoff at their own powerlessness in their very own nation". In his ballad "Dublin" (1939), composed as the rest of the remnants of British overlordship were being expelled from Ireland, Louis MacNeice conceives "Nelson on his column/Watching his reality collapse".<br>Austin Clarke's 1957 sonnet "Nelson's Pillar, Dublin" hates the different plans to evacuate the landmark and finishes up "Let him watch the sky/With the individuals who rule. Stone eye/And telescopes can demonstrate/Our endowments are above".
