When he meets Auron, Tidus discovers that Jecht and Auron made a similar journey ten years before to ensure the summoner Braska (Yuna's dad) and vanquished Sin (who was reawakened as Jecht). As the adventure proceeds, Tidus, losing trust that he will return home, starts a sentimental association with Yuna and swears not to give her bite the dust after the watchmen a chance to disclose to him that Sin's fight will kill her. At the point when the gathering approaches Zanarkand, Tidus discovers that he and Zanarkand are the fantasies of dead individuals known as "fayth". "Dream" Zanarkand was made when Sin was conceived amid the war among Zanarkand and Bevelle and the first Zanarkand was destoyed. In the event that Sin is forever crushed, the calling of Dream Zanarkand and its kin (counting Tidus) will stop. In the genuine Zanarkand, the gathering chooses to figure out how to obliterate Sin which does not require the penance of a watchman or a summoner. They assault Sin, entering its shell. They in the long run discover Jecht (whom they should annihilation to dispose of Sin), and Tidus makes harmony with his dad in the outcome. Subsequent to crushing the soul of Yu Yevon (who is in charge of Sin's resurrection), the "fayth" are permitted to leave and the calling of Dream Zanarkand closes. As he evaporates, Tidus bids a fond farewell to his companions and joins the spirits of Auron, Jecht and Braska in life following death.
