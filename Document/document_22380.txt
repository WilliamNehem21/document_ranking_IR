At 18:50 the same day, Lent and his "StaffelkapitÃ¤n" Werner Hansen took off again from Fornebu in undamaged BfÂ 110s. During the 40-minute flight, they came across a RAF Short Sunderland flying boat, serial number "L2167", from No. 210 Squadron RAF which they shot down together; Hansen received credit for the "kill".
