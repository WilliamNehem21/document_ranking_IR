Surveying "Place of Music" in "Stimulation Weekly", Ken Tucker discovered Tony! Toni! TonÃÂ©'s! impersonations of great sounds "shrewd, once in a while splendid", "clever", and "massively affable", with "another common subject: what makes a man a man and a lady a lady, investigated with both straightforwardness and cleverness". Sonia Murray of "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" hailed it as the band's most efficacious and multifaceted record yet, while "Chicago Tribune" commentator Greg Kot said "they discover bliss that is saturated with reality as opposed to in the upwardly versatile dream devised by numerous individuals of the present less custom cognizant R&B crooners." "The Tonies fill in as a kind of elaborate missing connection", J. D. Considine wrote in "The Baltimore Sun", "proposing what might have happened had the spirit styles of the '70s kept on advancing, rather than being hurled aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s". Michael A. Gonzales from "Vibe" said the collection "shines a dream of darkness that is superbad, frantic smooth, and insane hot". He portrayed it as "a wonderland of consonant enjoyments, softcore jollies, and moderate jam fever drifting on the tip of Cupid's bolt", demonstrating the gathering "investigating the arousing quality of dark fly without seeming like lane menaces stalking their objects of want".
