Views of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions. Mark Langer, in the "American Dictionary of National Biography", writes that "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture." Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas", while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its "smooth faÃ§ade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history". Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time, there were criticisms by reviewers. Caroline Lejeune comments in "The Observer" that "Snow White" (1937) "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn." Robin Allen, writing for "The Times", notes that "Fantasia" (1940) was "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into bathos", while Lejeune, reviewing "Alice in Wonderland" (1951), feels the film "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy". "Peter Pan" (1953) was criticized in "The Times" as "a children's classic vulgarized" with "Tinker BellÂ ... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".
