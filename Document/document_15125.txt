Currently, both "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" are classified within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, argued that a synonymy is very probable in the light of new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original "Nemegtosaurus" quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the "Nemegtosaurus" holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the "Nemegtosaurus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the "Opisthocoelicaudia" holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous â a diagnostic feature of "Opisthocoelicaudia" â suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-BiaÅynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" can be formally declared synonyms.
