Amid the initial four years of Henry's rule Gerard was one of the ruler's main consultants, alongside Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry's most noteworthy supporters among the diocesans amid the Investiture Crisis. In 1101 Gerard saw a settlement among Henry and Robert, the Count of Flanders, which looked quite far to separate Robert from any future clash among Henry and his senior sibling Robert Curthose, or among Henry and King Philip I of France. After Gerard's arrival from Rome he reestablished Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm would not sanctify three ministers, two of whom had gotten inauguration from the ruler; Gerard offered to bless them rather, however all aside from one can't. From 1105 onwards Gerard gradually started to grasp the ecclesiastical position on inauguration of religious administrators, which restricted laymen contributing priests with the images of episcopal specialist. As a major aspect of his difference in position, Gerard pulled back from court to think about his ward. Towards the finish of 1105 Gerard endeavored to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was collecting a crusading power in France, yet it creates the impression that King Henry kept Gerard's takeoff. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was all the while getting ready to go on campaign, yet he never did. At about a similar time, Gerard was attempting to discover a commonly satisfactory goals to the Investiture Crisis, composing various letters and different works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had achieved an understanding settling the question.
