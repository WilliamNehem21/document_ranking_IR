After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Pháº¡m Ngá»c Tháº£o was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Tháº£o was told by KhiÃªm, his superior, to locate Diá»m and prevent him from being killed. When Tháº£o arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diá»m and Nhu overheard him and ThÆ¡ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant ThÆ¡ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. ThÆ¡ recorded Diá»m's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being "I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyá»n KhÃ¡nh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the NgÃ´ brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.
