Pink Floyd likewise made a few film scores, beginning in 1968, with "The Committee". In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film "More". The soundtrack demonstrated helpful: in addition to the fact that it paid well, alongside "A Saucerful of Secrets", the material they made turned out to be a piece of their live shows for quite a while from that point. While making the soundtrack for executive Michelangelo Antonioni's film "Zabriskie Point", the band remained at a lavish lodging in Rome for just about a month. Waters guaranteed that, without Antonioni's consistent changes to the music, they would have finished the work in under seven days. In the long run he utilized just three of their chronicles. One of the pieces turned somewhere around Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later progressed toward becoming "Us and Them", included on 1973's "The Dark Side of the Moon". In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film "La VallÃÂ©e", for which they discharged a soundtrack collection called "Darkened by Clouds". They made the material in about seven days at the ChÃÂ¢teau d'HÃÂ©rouville close Paris, and upon its discharge, it wound up Pink Floyd's first collection to break into the topÃÂ 50 on the US "Board" outline.
