"Gatekeepers" includes a story inside a story as "Stories of the Black Freighter", an anecdotal comic book from which scenes show up in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The anecdotal comic's story, "Marooned", is perused by a young in New York City. Moore and Gibbons considered a privateer comic since they contemplated that since the characters of "Guardians" experience superheroes, all things considered, "they most likely wouldn't be at all keen on superhuman funnies." Gibbons proposed a privateer topic, and Moore concurred to a limited extent since he is "a major Bertolt Brecht fan": the "Dark Freighter" suggests the tune "SeerÃÂ¤uberjenny" ("Pirate Jenny") from Brecht's "Threepenny Opera". Moore guessed that since superheroes existed, and existed as "objects of dread, hating, and disdain, the principle superheroes rapidly dropped out of prevalence in comic books, as we recommend. Mostly, classes like awfulness, sci-fi, and robbery, especially theft, ended up unmistakableÃ¢ÂÂwith EC riding the peak of the wave." Moore felt "the symbolism of the entire privateer type is so rich and dim that it gave an ideal contradiction to the contemporary universe of "Guards"". The author developed the reason so its essence in the story would include subtext and moral story. The supplemental article enumerating the anecdotal history of "Stories of the Black Freighter" toward the finish of issue five credits genuine craftsman Joe Orlando as a noteworthy supporter of the arrangement. Moore picked Orlando since he felt that if privateer stories were prevalent in the "Guards" universe that DC proofreader Julius Schwartz may have attempted to bait the craftsman over to the organization to draw a privateer comic book. Orlando contributed an illustration structured as though it were a page from the phony title to the supplemental piece.
