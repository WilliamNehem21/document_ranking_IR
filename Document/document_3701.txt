Williams consented to the undertaking to work with Lonergan, whose work she appreciated, and in planning, she visited Manchester to talk with neighborhood moms about their lives. She additionally worked with a lingo mentor to receive a Massachusetts complement. In spite of the film's dreariness, Williams related to her character's longing to recover her life even with disaster.
