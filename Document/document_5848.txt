The house has a L-formed arrangement, and the outside is plain, of red block, with Bath stone dressings and green rooftop slates from Cumberland. With a story plan of 50ÃÂ feet by square, , Burges approached its development on a stupendous scale. The planner R. Norman Shaw commented that the solid establishments were appropriate "for a fortification". This methodology, joined with Burges' design abilities and the base of outside improvement, made a structure that Crook portrayed as "straightforward and enormous". Following his standard example, Burges re-worked numerous components of before structures, adjusting them as fitting. The frontages originate from the other townhouse he planned, the McConnochie House in Cardiff, in spite of the fact that they have been turned around, with the arcaded, road front from the McConnochie House framing the greenery enclosure front of the Tower House. The staircase is committed to the cone shaped pinnacle, staying away from the blunder Burges made at the before house, where he put the staircase amidst the corridor. The tube shaped pinnacle and tapered rooftop get from Castell Coch, and the insides are propelled from models at Cardiff Castle. The house has two principle floors, with a storm cellar beneath and a garret above. The ground floor contains an illustration room, a lounge area and a library, while the principal floor has two rooms and an ordnance.
