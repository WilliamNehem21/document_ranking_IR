Musically, Bax veered far from the impact of Wagner and Strauss, and intentionally received what he thought about as a Celtic phrase. In 1908 he started a set of three of tone sonnets called "Eire" (I. "Into the Twilight"/II. "In the FaÃÂ«ry Hills"/III. "Roscatha"), depicted by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the start of the writer's really develop style. The first of these pieces, "Into the Twilight", was debuted by Thomas Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the next year, at Elgar's incitement, Henry Wood authorized the second in the cycle, "In the FaÃÂ«ry Hills". The work got blended takes note. "The Manchester Guardian's" analyst expressed, "Mr Bax has joyfully proposed the suitable air of puzzle"; "The Observer" found the piece "very undeterminate and uninspiring, however not hard to pursue". "The Times" remarked on the "somewhat second-hand language" at certain focuses, subordinate of Wagner and Debussy, despite the fact that "there is still an extraordinary arrangement which is entirely person". "The Musical Times" commended "a spiritualist charm that couldn't neglect to be felt by the audience" despite the fact that the rationality of the piece "was not in a flash recognizable". A third work in the cycle, "Roscatha", was not performed in the author's lifetime.
