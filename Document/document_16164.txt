"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was written by BeyoncÃ©, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell, and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. BeyoncÃ© recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized "Single Ladies" after BeyoncÃ©'s secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was "the only public statement that [BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the song BeyoncÃ© had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. BeyoncÃ©'s marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with "Billboard" magazine, BeyoncÃ© added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that "people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate". She stated that although "Single Ladies" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.
