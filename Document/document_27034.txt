There is widespread disagreement on aspects of species-level lemur taxonomy, particularly concerning the recent increase in the number of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are currently 101Â recognized species or subspecies of extant lemur, divided into five families and 15Â genera. Conversely, other experts in the field label this as a possible example of taxonomic inflation, and prefer instead an estimate of at least 50 species. All sides generally agree that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs should be classified in three families, eight genera, and 17Â species.
Over the past two decades, the number of recognized lemur species has more than tripled according to some experts. In 1994, 32Â distinct species were named in the first edition of Conservation International's field guide, "Lemurs of Madagascar", and 68Â were described in the 2nd edition, published in 2006. In December 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and other experts co-wrote an article in the "International Journal of Primatology" classifying 99Â species and subspecies. In late 2010, the 3rd edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar" listed 101Â taxa. The number of lemur species is likely to continue growing in the coming years, as field studies, cytogenetic and molecular genetic research continues, particularly on cryptic species, such as mouse lemurs, which cannot be distinguished visually.
