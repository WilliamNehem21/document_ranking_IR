On 6 February 1916, the scout cruiser , "78ÃÂ T" and five other 250t-class water crafts were blocked by the British light cruiser and French destroyer north of Durazzo in Albania, amid which the main harm was brought about by an impact between two of the other 250t-class vessels. In 1917, one of her 66ÃÂ mm weapons was set on an enemy of airplane mount. On 11 May 1917, the British submarine stalked "78 T" off Pola, terminating two torpedoes at her. The British chief had kept his submarine's periscope expanded excessively far and for a really long time, and the obvious "plume" had alarmed the team of "78 T", enabling her group to keep away from the approaching torpedoes. That night, the , joined by "78ÃÂ T" and two other 250t-class pontoons, were sought after in the northern Adriatic by an Italian power of five destroyers, yet had the capacity to resign to security behind a minefield. On 23 September, "77ÃÂ T" and "78ÃÂ T" were laying a minefield off Grado in the northern Adriatic when they had a short experience with an Italian MAS vessel. On 28 November, various 250t-class water crafts were engaged with two shore siege missions. In the second mission, "78ÃÂ T" joined seven other 250t-class water crafts and six destroyers for the siege of Porto Corsini, Marotta and Cesenatico. By 1918, the Allies had reinforced their progressing bar on the Strait of Otranto, as predicted by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Subsequently, it was ending up increasingly troublesome for the German and Austro-Hungarian U-water crafts to get past the strait and into the Mediterranean Sea. In light of these barricades, the new authority of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, "Konteradmiral" MiklÃÂ³s Horthy, chose to dispatch an assault on the Allied protectors with war vessels, scout cruisers, and destroyers.
