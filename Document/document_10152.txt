Not long after the 1916 season began, it turned out to be evident that the Dodgers were one of the better groups in the association. Robinson figured out how to crush one more year of efficiency out of some more seasoned veterans, for example, Chief Meyers, who said of Stengel, "It was Casey who kept us on our toes. He was the life of the gathering and simply kept all us old-clocks pepped up all season." Stengel, for the most part playing right field, hit .279 with eight homers, one not exactly the group head in that class, Wheat. Stengel's grand slam off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 recreations that year, in the second round of a doubleheader on September 30, gave the edge of triumph as the Dodgers went into the lead position to remain, meeting all requirements for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Regardless of getting two hits in a Game 1 misfortune at Boston, Stengel was sidelined for Game 2 in light of the fact that the Red Sox were pitching a left hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's solitary triumph of the arrangement. He was sidelined again in Game 4 against left hander Dutch Leonard, however he was embedded as a squeeze sprinter, and got another hit in the Game 5 misfortune, completing 4 for 11, .364, the best Dodger batting normal of the Series.
