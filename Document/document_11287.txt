The broadness of "The Final Frontier"s areas drove Goldsmith to shun the two-themed approach of "The Motion Picture" for leitmotifs, repeating music utilized for areas and characters. Sybok is presented with an integrated theme in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock talk about him in transit to Nimbus III it is rendered in an increasingly secretive manner. The theme additionally shows up in the activity prompt as Kirk and friends arrive on Nimbus III and endeavor to free the prisoners. At the point when Sybok sheets the "Venture", another four-note theme played by low metal features the character's fixation. The Sybok topic from that point on is utilized in either a kind sense or an increasingly percussive, dull version. Touching base at Sha Ka Ree, the planet's five-note topic looks to some extent like Goldsmith's unicorn subject from "Legend"; "the two songs speak to fundamentally the same as thoughts: lost blamelessness and the lamentable difficulty of recovering heaven," composes Bond. The music highlights cellos passing on a devout quality, while the presence of "God" starts with string glissandos yet swings to a dim interpretation of Sybok's subject as its actual nature is uncovered. As the animal assaults Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more forceful Sybok topic takes on an assaulting beat. At the point when Spock requests to the Klingons for help, the topic assumes a touchy personality before coming back to a ground-breaking succession as the ship demolishes the god-animal.
