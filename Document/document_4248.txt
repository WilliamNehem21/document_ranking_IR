Warhol, a business artist who turned into an effective creator, distributer, painter, and movie executive, demonstrated the work on July 9, 1962, in his initial limited display show as a fine craftsman in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles, California curated by Irving Blum. The show denoted the West Coast presentation of pop workmanship. The mix of the semi-motorized procedure, the non-painterly style, and the business subject at first caused offense, as the work's glaringly commonplace corporate greed spoken to an immediate attack against the system and logic of unique expressionism. In the United States the dynamic expressionism workmanship development was prevailing amid the post-war period, and it held not exclusively to "compelling artwork" qualities and feel yet in addition to a mysterious tendency. This discussion prompted a lot of discussion about the benefits and morals of such work. Warhol's thought processes as a craftsman were addressed, and they keep on being topical right up 'til today. The extensive open tumult changed Warhol from being a cultivated 1950s business artist to a striking fine craftsman, and it recognized him from other rising pop specialists. Albeit business interest for his depictions was not prompt, Warhol's relationship with the subject prompted his name getting to be synonymous with the "Campbell's Soup Can" artistic creations.
