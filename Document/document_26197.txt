In reptiles, features of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in "T.Â maculata", the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in "T.Â maculata". There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63â64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). "Mabuya" species and "T.Â maculata" generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29Â subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in "T.Â maculata", which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26Â presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most "Trachylepis", but unlike American "Mabuya", which have at least 28.
