American Pharoah's next race was the Haskell Invitational, held August 2 at Monmouth Park, New Jersey. Zayat needed the pony's first race back be a "simple" race against other 3-year-olds, he needed to race the steed in Zayat's home territory of New Jersey, and he needed to race on a Sunday to maintain a strategic distance from a conflict with the Jewish Sabbath. Zayat clarified, "He can run anywhereÃÂ ... for whatever length of time that he's cheerful and healthyÃÂ ... I told [Monmouth]ÃÂ ... 'I need to do it for the game and not stress over the cash and stuff." Nonetheless, Monmouth Park collected the handbag cash for the race from $1 million to $1.75 million. Zayat had recently won the Haskell with Paynter in 2012, and Baffert officially held the record for the most Haskell wins, having seven past triumphs. More than 60,000 individuals appeared at Monmouth Park, which included the Bruce Springsteen melody "Destined to Run" in the post march. Seen as being in far better physical condition than in the Belmont, American Pharoah led the pack in the far turn and effectively opened up a five-length lead over the six different ponies in the race before Espinoza moved him back as second-place finisher Keen Ice made a solid completing push. He won the race by lengths with a period of 1:47.95 for the 9-furlong remove. Espinoza jested, "He was having a ton of fun, as was I." Baffert stated, "He just continues presenting to it; he's an incredible pony."
