As indicated by Dekema, making arrangements for I-805 started in 1956. The first directing for I-805 was affirmed as an Interstate Highway in July 1958. It was added to the state interstate framework and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as RouteÃÂ 241. I-805 was required to lessen traffic on what was then USÃÂ 101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the previous was opened. RouteÃÂ 241 was renumbered to RouteÃÂ 805 in the 1964 state thruway renumbering, and I-5 was assigned along the course from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further arranging was in progress in 1965, with the objective to have the course worked by 1972, the government roadway subsidizing due date. This was to be the main turnpike in the zone with no earlier street along its course that it would supplant; the objective was to give a detour around San Diego for those heading out to Mexico, and improve access for neighborhood inhabitants. By June, houses along the course in the North Park zone were being sold, as the land was required for the principal stretch of the turnpike to be developed. The following year, Dekema affirmed that the principal part of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be constructed would be among Home and Adams roads.
