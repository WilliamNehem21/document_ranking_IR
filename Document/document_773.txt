On-set PC created impacts for the pilot were finished by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, in view of time and cash, must be made carefully. The opening succession demonstrating the annihilation of the water tower by a meteor was made on the PC. A steady issue amid generation was the absence of cornfields. As sensible corn was a need for a show situated in Kansas, this turned into an issue for the movie producers. More than 10,000 stalks of corn were developed in a nursery for the pilot, however they just grew two feet high, which was not usable to the team. The day the group was shooting the scene for Clark's arrival there were no cornfields in the encompassing region. The cornfields must be carefully included. Advanced corn was a typical substitute for the undersized corn that was developed, however for scenes where computerized corn was impossible, six hundred stalks of phony corn were flown in from a producer in Arizona. Other computerized impacts incorporate the leveled cornfield where Lex was gotten in a shooting star impact. A few scenes required physical impacts, rather than PC symbolism. At the point when Lex drives his vehicle off a scaffold and hits Clark, the trick entertainer, who served as Wolverine in the film "X-Men", was actually hit by the vehicle as it went over the extension.
