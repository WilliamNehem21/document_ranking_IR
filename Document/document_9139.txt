"Mother and Me and Mom" (2013) is the seventh of Maya Angelou's arrangement of collections of memoirs. It was finished 11 years after the distribution of her past life account, "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" (2002), and more than thirty years after she kept in touch with her first personal history, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969). "Mother and Me and Mom", in which Angelou relates her association with her mom Vivian Baxter, was distributed in a matter of seconds before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday celebration. In the timeframe between the distribution of her 6th and seventh personal histories, Angelou was the main African-American lady and living artist chosen by Sterling Publishing, who set 25 of her ballads in a volume of their "Verse for Young People" arrangement in 2004. In 2009, Angelou expressed "We Had Him", a lyric about Michael Jackson, which was perused by Queen Latifah at his burial service, and stated "His Day is Done", a sonnet regarding Nelson Mandela after his passing in 2013. She distributed a book of papers, "Letter to My Daughter", in 2009, and two cookbooks, "Glory be! The Welcome Table" in 2004 and "Incredible Food, All Day Long" in 2010. Amid this period, she was granted the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.
