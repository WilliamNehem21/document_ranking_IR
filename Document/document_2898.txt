Meeker found that the last stretch between Fort Boise (presently Boise, Idaho) and The Dalles was the most troublesome. The area is loaded up with mountains and deserts, and there was minimal possibility of enhancing stores. The individuals who entered this fragment with depleted groups or negligible supplies frequently kicked the bucket along it. Others shed stuff brought crosswise over a large portion of a mainland, sparing just arrangements. Gatherings who dreaded this piece of the adventure here and there endeavored to coast down the Snake and Columbia Rivers; many were destroyed in the rapids and kicked the bucket. At The Dalles, where stream entry was accessible to Portland, the Meeker party found a diverse horde of wanderers. With the cash earned at the ship, they booked entry downriver. Oliver Meeker brought the animals ahead overland, and met Ezra and his family on their landing in Portland on October 1, 1852, where they rested inside a house out of the blue since leaving Iowa. Ezra Meeker had lost and had $2.75 in real money. The majority of the gathering endure, despite the fact that Jacob Davenport, one of Oliver Meeker's companions from Indiana, turned out to be sick on the last piece of the excursion and kicked the bucket a little while in the wake of achieving Portland. Everything except one of the animals finished the outingÃ¢ÂÂa cow was lost while crossing the Missouri River. Ezra Meeker considered his voyage over the Oregon Trail to have been the creation of him as a man.
