During the 890s, Bishop Asser gave the main enduring contemporary evaluation of ÃÂthelbald. Asser, who was threatening to him both in light of his rebel against his dad and due to his uncanonical marriage, portrayed him as "unfair and getting a handle on" and his rule as "over two uncivilized years", including that numerous individuals credited the insubordination "exclusively to egotism with respect to King ÃÂthelbald, on the grounds that he was getting a handle on in this undertaking and numerous different bad behaviors". Post-Conquest administrative recorders received Asser's perspectives. William of Malmesbury composed that "ÃÂthelbald, who was useless and unfaithful to his dad, debased his dad's marriage-bed, for after his dad's demise he sank so low as to wed his stepmother Judith." According to John of Worcester, "ÃÂthelbald, in insubordination of God's forbiddance and Christian poise, and even against every single agnostic uniquely, moved into his dad's marriage-bed, wedded Judith, little girl of Charles, ruler of the Franks, and held the administration of the kingdom of the West Saxons without limitation for two and half years after his dad's passing". Roger of Wendover censured ÃÂthelbald in comparative terms, however guaranteed that in 859 he apologized of his blunder, set aside Judith and managed from there on "in harmony and exemplary nature". The special case was Henry of Huntingdon, who expressed that ÃÂthelbald and ÃÂthelberht, "young fellows of superlative common quality, had their kingdoms in all respects prosperously as long as they each lived. Whenever ÃÂthelbald, King of Wessex, had held his kingdom calmly for a long time, he was stolen away by an unexpected passing. All England deplored King ÃÂthelbald's childhood and there was incredible distress over him. Also, they covered him at Sherborne. After this England was aware of what it had lost in him."
