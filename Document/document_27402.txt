Against his wishes, Kesselring was discharged from the army on 1 October 1933 and appointed head of the Department of Administration at the Reich Commissariat for Aviation ("Reichskommissariat fÃ¼r die Luftfahrt"), the forerunner of the Reich Air Ministry ("Reichsluftfahrtministerium"), with the rank of "Oberst" (colonel). Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from establishing an air force, this was nominally a civilian agency. The "Luftwaffe" would formally be established on 26 February 1935. As chief of administration, he had to assemble his new staff from scratch. He was involved in the re-establishment of the aviation industry and the construction of secret factories, forging alliances with industrialists and aviation engineers. He was promoted to "Generalmajor" (major general) in 1934 and "Generalleutnant" (lieutenant general) in 1936. Like other generals of Nazi Germany, he received personal monthly payments from Adolf Hitler; in Kesselring's case, RM 6,000, a considerable sum at the time.
At the age of 48, he learned to fly. Kesselring believed that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial to being able to command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945.
