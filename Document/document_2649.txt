PaveliÃÂ and his devotees planned to make an "ethnically unadulterated" Croatia through the mass homicide and extradition of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Just around 50% of the NDH's 6.2 million occupants were Croat. Almost two million Serbs, around 33% of the NDH's all out populace, presently ended up inside the outskirts of the recently shaped state. What's more, Serb-lion's share territories secured somewhere in the range of 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's all out landmass. "The Croatian state can't exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and in the event that we have an incredible Serbian state at our backs," Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen LorkoviÃÂ clarified. "Hence, we are endeavoring to influence the Serbs to vanish from our locales." Dido Kvaternik, a senior UstaÃÂ¡e official, was endowed with "purging" Bjelovar and its environment. The more youthful Kvaternik reviewed: "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when PaveliÃÂ concluded that I should assume control over the execution of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed quickly and decisively in light of the fact that I realized that this inquiry must be settled for the fate of the Croatian individuals and state, and that somebody needed to make the penance so these terrible however vital allots could be conveyed." PaveliÃÂ's requests for the killing of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely conveyed orally to guarantee that no composed proof remained.
