The RAAF moved to rectify the situation by re-forming No.Â 2Â OTU on 1 March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deÂ Havilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.Â 2 OTU on 21 May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.Â 2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, in concert with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3 December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.Â 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.Â 77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS "Vengeance". Training courses on the Sabre began on 1 January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.Â 3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.Â 2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.
