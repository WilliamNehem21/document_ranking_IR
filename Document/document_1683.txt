After Tamil Brahmi dropped out of utilization, Tamil was composed utilizing a content called among others, for example, Grantha and Pallava. The present Tamil content comprises of 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one unique character, the "ÃÂytam". The vowels and consonants join to shape 216 compound characters, giving a sum of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 x 18)). All consonants have an innate vowel "a", similarly as with other Indic contents. This characteristic vowel is evacuated by including a tittle called a "", to the consonantal sign. For instance, is "Ã¡Â¹Âa" (with the inalienable "an") and is "Ã¡Â¹Â" (without a vowel). Numerous Indic contents have a comparable sign, conventionally called virama, however the Tamil content is to some degree diverse in that it about dependably utilizes an unmistakable "puÃ¡Â¸Â·Ã¡Â¸Â·i" to show a 'dead consonant' (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic contents, it is commonly liked to utilize a ligature or a half structure to compose a syllable or a group containing a dead consonant, in spite of the fact that composition it with an obvious virama is likewise conceivable. The Tamil content does not separate voiced and unvoiced plosives. Rather, plosives are explained with voice contingent upon their situation in a word, as per the principles of Tamil phonology.
