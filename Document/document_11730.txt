Ross and O'Reilly before long went to the typical division of work between the executive and associate: the chief would deal with open undertakings and settle on approach choices as required, while the partner managed the everyday business of the agency. Ross embraced an overwhelming travel plan, visiting Mint offices, making talks backing Roosevelt, and crusading for Democratic hopefuls in Wyoming. This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting chief. The two ladies carried on a professional yet warm correspondence amid these occasions, with O'Reilly keeping in touch with Ross (who had left on a voyage through the mints) "I am so on edge to have your brain quiet about the workplace here [in Washington] that I have depended on rather visit wires. They are a lot more immediate and forward-thinking than lettersÃÂ ... my adoration to you and each great wish for the achievement of your visits to our darling mint organizations." Scheer proposes that O'Reilly would have discovered Ross' reports from the field important; they indicated how the Mint recouped from the underlying long stretches of the Depression, when moderately few coins were created, to the mid-1930s, when solid interest for coinage drove the department to run the mints with two or even three movements.
