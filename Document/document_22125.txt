Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television. This time the studio was willing to grant it, making Skelton the only major MGM personality with the privilege. The 1950 negotiations allowed him to begin working in television beginning September 30, 1951. During the last portion of his contract with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on television in addition to films. He would go on to appear in films such as Jack Donohue's "The Yellow Cab Man" (1950), Roy Rowland and Buster Keaton's "Excuse My Dust" (1951), Charles Walters' "Texas Carnival" (1951), Mervyn LeRoy's "Lovely to Look At" (1952), Robert Z. Leonard's "The Clown" (1953) and "The Great Diamond Robbery" (1954), and Norman Z. McLeod's poorly received "Public Pigeon No. 1" (1957), his last major film role, which originated incidentally from an episode of the television anthology series "Climax!". In a 1956 interview, he said he would never work simultaneously in all three media again. As a result, Skelton would make only a couple of minor appearances in films after this, including playing a saloon drunk in "Around the World in Eighty Days" (1956), a gambler in "Ocean's 11" (1960), and a Neanderthal man in "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" (1965).
