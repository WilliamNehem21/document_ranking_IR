"Assemble", like quite a bit of African-American writing, delineates Rita's scan for self-revelation, character, and poise in the troublesome condition of bigotry, and how she, as other African Americans, had the capacity to transcend it. Rita's hunt is communicated both ostensibly, through her material needs, and deep down, through adoration and family connections. In "Confined Bird", in spite of injury and parental dismissal, Rita's reality is generally secure, yet the immature young lady in "Assemble" encounters the disintegration of her connections ordinarily. The forlornness that follows for her is "a dejection that moves toward becoming, now and again, self-destructive and adds to her unanchored self". Rita is uncertain of her identity or what she would turn out to be, so she attempts a few jobs in a fretful and baffled way, as teenagers frequently do amid this time of their lives. Her experimentation was a piece of her self-training that would effectively bring her into development and adulthood. Lupton concurs, expressing that Rita made due through experimentation while characterizing herself as a Black lady. Angelou perceives that the mix-ups she delineates are a piece of "the fumblings of youth and to be excused all things considered", yet youthful Rita demands that she assume liability for herself and her youngster.
