Different examples alluded to "Heterodontosaurus" incorporate the front piece of an adolescent skull (SAM-PK-K10487), a fragmentary maxilla (SAM-PK-K1326), a left maxilla with teeth and adjoining bones (SAM-PK-K1334), which were all gathered at the Voyizane territory amid undertakings in 1966Ã¢ÂÂ 1967, in spite of the fact that the first was just recognized as having a place with this class in 2008. A fractional nose (NM QR 1788) found in 1975 on Tushielaw Farm south of Voyizane was thought to have a place with "Massospondylus" until 2011, when it was renamed as "Heterodontosaurus". South African scientist Robert Broom found a fractional skull, conceivably in the Clarens Formation of South Africa, which was sold to the American Museum of Natural History in 1913, as a component of an accumulation that comprised as a rule of synapsid fossils. This example (AMNH 24000) was first recognized as having a place with a sub-grown-up "Heterodontosaurus" by Sereno, who revealed it in a 2012 monograph about the Heterodontosauridae, the primary far reaching survey article about the family. This audit additionally characterized an incomplete postcranial skeleton (SAM-PK-K1328) from Voyizane as "Heterodontosaurus". Be that as it may, in 2014, Galton recommended it may have a place with the related family "Pegomastax" rather, which was named by Sereno dependent on a halfway skull from a similar region. In 2005, another "Heterodontosaurus" example was found in a streambed close Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape Province; it was the most total individual known to date, yet the stones around it were excessively difficult to completely evacuate. The example was in this way checked at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 2016, to help uncover the skeleton, and help in future research of its life structures and way of life.
