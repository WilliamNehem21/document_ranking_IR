The pelvic bones are very much saved, with the correct side preferable enunciated over the left. The intertwined sacral vertebrae are as yet joined to the pelvis, which does not have the distal closures of both of its and (lower and rearmost hip bones). The (primary hip bone) is long. The (front development) of the ilium was bended on the base and was to some degree shorter and more profound than the (back extension). The preacetabular ala were to some degree extended at the front, rather than the more slim state of the postacetabular ala. The (groove at the base of the postacetabular ala) was curved, similar to the back edge of the ischium. The pubis bore a moderately vast and nearly shut , a space in the lower edge of the back piece of the bone that took into consideration the entry of the obturator nerve. The upwards anticipating neural spines of the sacrum were lengthened, as is normal in spinosaurs. Throughout everyday life, these would have been canvassed in skin, framing a "cruise" down the creature's back. MN 4819-V is recognized from "Suchomimus" because of its more extended and shallower ilium with a less bended upper edge, and from "Baryonyx" by having an increasingly created , a cutting edge like structure on the base of the ischium.
