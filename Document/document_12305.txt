In 1968 Le Mesurier was offered a job in another BBC circumstance satire playing an upper-working class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in "Father's Army"; he was the second decision after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was uncertain about accepting the part as he was completing the last arrangement of "George and the Dragon" and did not need another long haul TV job. He was convinced both by an expansion in his chargeÃ¢ÂÂto ÃÂ£262ÃÂ 10s (ÃÂ£262.50) per sceneÃ¢ÂÂand by the throwing of his old companion Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was at first uncertain of how to depict his character, and was prompted by arrangement author Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier chose to put together the character with respect to himself, later composition that "I thought, why not simply act naturally, utilize my very own expansion identity and carry on rather as I had done in the military? So I in every case left a catch or two fixed, and had the sleeve of my fight dress somewhat turned up. I talked delicately, issued directions as though they were solicitations (the sort not liable to be acknowledged) and by and large accepted a generous demeanor of defenselessness". Perry later seen that "we needed Wilson to be the voice of mental stability; he has moved toward becoming John".
