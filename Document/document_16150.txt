The first of these was "Daredevil" (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a longtime comic book fan, and had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's "Guardian Devil" (1999) about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" said Affleck was "lost" in the role: "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." In 2014, Affleck described "Daredevil" as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy "Gigli" (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" remarking that "Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing him as "one of the really great directors". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller "Paycheck" (2003). Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" remarked on Affleck's "self-deprecating charm" and wondered why he could not find better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" found it "almost unfair" to critique Affleck, given that he "had such a rough year".
