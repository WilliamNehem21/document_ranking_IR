The task started on the morning of 12 October, when "Moltke" and the III Squadron ships drew in Russian positions in Tagga Bay while "Kaiserin" and the remainder of IV Squadron shelled Russian firearm batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on ÃÂsel. "Kaiserin", alongside "Kaiser" and "Prinzregent Luitpold", were entrusted with hushing the Russian firearms at Hundsort on ÃÂsel, which had taken "Moltke" enduring an onslaught. The boats opened flame at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian terminating had stopped and German troops were moving shorewards. After two days, Souchon left Tagga Bay with "Kaiserin", "Friedrich der Grosse", and "Prinzregent Luitpold" to help German ground powers progressing on the Sworbe Peninsula. "Kaiserin" was relegated to stifle a Russian battery at Zerel, however substantial mist postponed her from connecting with her objective. The Russians opened flame first, which was immediately returned by "Kaiserin" and "KÃÂ¶nig Albert". "Friedrich der Grosse" provided to the two boats' with some timely help; the three war vessels shot an aggregate of 120 extensive bore shells over the range of 60 minutes. The fourth Russian salvo straddled "Kaiserin", which started to control sporadically to maintain a strategic distance from the Russian gunfire. The substantial discharging incited a large portion of the Russian weapon teams to escape their posts.
