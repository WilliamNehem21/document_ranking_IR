Different pundits felt that the film was unremarkable with respect to its story and characters, and that it neglected to convey as a non-melodic to Disney's conventional group of onlookers. Owen Gleiberman of "Excitement Weekly" gave the film a C+ rating, composing that the film had "hmm marvel conventional character" and was "the quintessence of specialty without dream". Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" said the storyline and portrayals were "antiquated" and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday-morning animation, yet these inadequacies were balanced by its "energetic activity" and wild eyed pace. Todd McCarthy of "Assortment" expressed, "Disney pushes into all-talking, no-singing, no-moving and, at last, no-fun energized an area." Stephanie Zacharek of "Salon" composed of Disney's endeavor to make the film for a grown-up group of onlookers, "The enormous issue with Disney's most recent enlivened element, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", is that it doesn't appear to be adapted to kids by any stretch of the imagination: It's adult to the point that it's hugely exhausting." Rita Kempley of "The Washington Post" panned the film, considering it "another molded yet old-fangled hash" and stated, "Incidentally Disney had wanted to refresh its picture with this somewhat occupying experience, yet the image hasn't generally split far from the time tested organization caricature in the far unrivaled "Shrek"."
