At that point, in 1957, the northernmost piece of present SRÃÂ 57 was added to the state interstate framework as a feature of Route 240, which the assembly assigned along the course got ready for I-210. This turned out to be a piece of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly expansion of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) close Huntington Beach was included 1959 as RouteÃÂ 273. Additionally in 1959, the governing body made RouteÃÂ 272, expanding the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, finishing the proposed expressway hall that is presently SRÃÂ 57. At the point when the whole course, aside from RouteÃÂ 240 which was still piece of I-210, was redesignated SRÃÂ 57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed turnpikes had been manufactured; the main developed fragment was the old surface street from Fullerton towards Pomona. The piece of old RouteÃÂ 19 east of RouteÃÂ 272 turned out to be a piece of SR 60. As a major aspect of the equivalent renumbering, RouteÃÂ 180 on State College Boulevard progressed toward becoming RouteÃÂ 250, which was corrected the following year to accommodate its cancellation once that bit of the SRÃÂ 57 interstate was finished (between I-5 and SR 91).
