Utilizing John Wisdom's illustration of the undetectable plant specialist, Flew endeavored to exhibit that religious language is unfalsifiable. The anecdote recounts to the narrative of two individuals who find a patio nursery on a betrayed island; one trusts it is tended to by a plant specialist, the different trusts that it shaped normally, without the presence of a planter. The two watch out for the planter however never discover him; the non-adherent thus keeps up that there is no cultivator, though the devotee supports the non-appearance by recommending that the nursery worker is undetectable and can't be identified. Flew fought that if the adherent's translation is acknowledged, nothing remains of the first plant specialist. He contended that religious adherents will in general embrace partner justifications in light of any evident test to their convictions from experimental proof; and these convictions subsequently endure a "demise by a thousand capabilities" as they are qualified and changed so much that they end up stating nothing important. Flew connected his standards to religious cases, for example, God's affection for people, contending that in the event that they are important attestations they would preclude a specific state from claiming undertakings. He contended that when looked with proof against the presence of a cherishing God, for example, the terminal sickness of a youngster, theists will qualify their cases to consider such proof; for instance they may recommend that God's affection is not quite the same as human love. Such capabilities, Flew contended, make the first recommendation good for nothing; he addressed what God's affection really guarantees and what it ensures against, and suggested that God's certified love guarantees nothing and winds up useless.
