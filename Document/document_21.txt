Most Japanese flying machine were reviewed to shield Truk and 19 February saw the last noteworthy capture of Allied air ship over Rabaul.

Powers relegated incorporated the first Cavalry Division; No.ÃÂ 73 Wing RAAF, giving close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' first Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to manufacture the maritime baseÃ¢ÂÂa sum of 45,000ÃÂ personnel. Notwithstanding, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell planes flew low over Los Negros. The aviators detailed that there were no indications of foe action and the islands had been cleared. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the administrator of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and recommended that the abandoned islands be immediately taken by a little power. As per Kenney: "The General tuned in for some time, paced forward and backward as I continued talking, gestured every so often, at that point all of a sudden halted and stated: That will put the plug in the jug."
