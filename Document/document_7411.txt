The signature melody for "Murder: Life on the Street" was created by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted one of a few tapes sent to the makers for thought. "Murder" makers at first experienced difficulty finding the correct tune, and Levinson at last picked Kowal's subjects in light of the fact that, while the majority of the hopefuls too intently taken after ordinary TV signature tunes, Levinson felt Kowal's tune "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was irregular". Music is displayed in different ways all through the principal period of "Manslaughter". A few tunes are played on radios that play in the murder squad room, similar to "Set out My Life" via Carole King, "Texas Slide" by Jean-Jacques Milteau, "N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)" by Charles and Eddie, "Young man Blues" and "Separate" by Gary Fitzgerald, and "Tropic Call" by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, which are all included in "Night of the Dead Living". Different tunes are increasingly coordinated into the show itself, as "Murky Shade of Blue", a Tor Hyams tune that plays while the police strike a few neighborhood homes looking for hints amid "Apparition of a Chance", and the song "The Sweet By and By", which is sung at a congregation amid Adena Watson's burial service in that equivalent scene. A few different tunes are highlighted in scenes all through the primary season, including "Elephant Walk" by "The Kings", "The Beat Goes On" by Sonny Bono, "Going' Around in Circles" by Jules Taub, "Phone Blues" by Sam Ling and George Smith, and "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" by Freddie Perren and Christine Yarian.
