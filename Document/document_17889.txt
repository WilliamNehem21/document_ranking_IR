"Lego Star Wars II" won and was nominated for numerous awards, and ranked on several video game lists. The official "Star Wars" website declared "Lego Star Wars II" to be the best "Star Wars"-related product of 2006. The game won iParenting Media Awards' "2006 Greatest Products Call", and was placed on "Reader's Digest"s September 2006 "5 Things We Don't Want You to Miss" list, "Time" magazine's list of the top ten video games of 2006, and GameSpy's PC "Game of the Year" list. It received the 2006 Game of the Year award from Nick Jr. and from IGN (for PC games only). It won Spike TV Video Game Awards 2006's "Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show", and "Best Gameplay" from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts's 3rd British Academy Video Games Awards. It received BAFTA nominations in three other categories, including "Best Game". In contrast, the previously poorly received DS version was listed as one of the "tears" on IGN's September 2009 "Cheers & Tears" list of action games for the DS. The editors of "Computer Games Magazine" named "Lego Star War II" the fifth-best computer game of 2006, and called it "a superb action/adventure, one with [...] an almost puppy dog-like insistence that you love it."
