Davies composed previous Prime Minister Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) into the content on Ã¢ÂÂ before Wilton was drawn closer about repeating the jobÃ¢ÂÂsince Gardner and Collinson wanted for the character to have a delightful and redemptive end; in the dÃÂ©nouement of her past appearance in "The Christmas Invasion", the character confronted a demonstration of majority disapproval in Parliament after she requested Torchwood to shoot down an escaping Sycorax send. Harriet Jones' story circular segment in this way framed a tripartite storyline which comprised of a presentation, hostility towards the Doctor, and recovery (though at an incredible expense). Davies knew that Wilton was "difficult to book" and confined her appearance to one day's taping in one area (Harriet's home) to make dealings simpler; had Wilton declined, Davies intended to supplant her with either Donna, Mr Copper (Clive Swift) from "Voyage of the Damned", or Elton from "Affection and Monsters". Wilton acknowledged genuinely on the grounds that she "would do anything for ... Davies" and she wished to act in Phil Collinson's last shooting square as maker; her first appearance in "Outsiders of London" was shot in the primary creation square of the principal arrangement. Collinson and Davies deplored the character's passing: Collinson "[couldn't] bear the musing she's dead" and contended that she got away demise; and Davies for the most part expressed in "Specialist Who Magazine" issue 397 that "when [significant characters an essayist creates] need to kick the bucket, it's a really passionate time".
