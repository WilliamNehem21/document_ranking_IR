In mid-April, the under-quality regiment turned out to be so scattered while securing devastation parties at oil establishments around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot came back from emergency clinic he was educated the force had stopped to exist. He was all things considered ready to accumulate the remainders, presently numbering 7 officers and 170 different positions, at Shwebo on 27ÃÂ April, and the force was in this manner strengthened by a draft of 3 officers and 120 different positions. At the point when the Japanese compromised Monywa, Bagot took order of the considerable number of troops in the territory, which incorporated the first Battalion, to shape Bagot Force. This blended gathering of units battled a deferring activity at Budalin, north of Monywa, on 4ÃÂ May before pulling back to Ye-u. The regiment kept on going about as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9ÃÂ May and into India at Tamu toward the month's end. In the meantime, the Japanese stopped activities in Burma. Since the beginning of the retreat from Rangoon on 7ÃÂ March the legion had lost 8 officers and 156 different positions slaughtered in real life or passed on of disorder, and a lot progressively injured. The force was refreshed and conveyed back up to quality in India, where it spent the rest of the war, and saw no further activity.
