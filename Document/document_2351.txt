Coming back to a vocation in the material science division at Auckland, Gascoigne took a shot at military optics, creating weapon sights and rangefinders, despite the fact that he didn't stay there for long. Richard van der Riet Woolley, executive of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in Canberra (presently Mount Stromlo Observatory), searched out Gascoigne in light of the fact that his "involvement in optical work [was] one of a kind" and Gascoigne was "prepared such that nobody else in Australia has been qualified". At the point when in 1941 Gascoigne was offered an exploration association by Woolley, he moved to Canberra. The Solar Observatory staff had comparative obligations to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first undertaking was to structure an enemy of flying machine weapon sight, and he was additionally engaged with a scope of other military optical activities. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was shut. Gascoigne restored the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, utilizing two Shortt-Synchronome timekeepers and galactic watching gear that he and his associates adjusted; the Time Service stayed at Mount Stromlo until 1968. The information and experience Gascoigne picked up amid the war demonstrated profitable. He was at the main office in Australia where optical work should be possible, from structure and production to gathering and testing. Gascoigne built up a wide scope of abilities and "wrapped up very down to earth, particularly with a screwdriver."
