With the exception of episodes of epilepsy that showed in seizures at regular intervals, Pedro had dependably delighted in hearty wellbeing. The war, in any case, undermined his constitution and by 1834 he was biting the dust of tuberculosis. He was bound to his bed in Queluz Royal Palace from 10 September. Pedro directed an open letter to the Brazilians, in which he asked that a slow cancelation of subjection be embraced. He cautioned them: "Subjugation is a fiendishness, and an assault against the rights and respect of the human species, yet its results are less unsafe to the individuals who endure in imprisonment than to the Nation whose laws permit servitude. It is a malignancy that eats up its profound quality." After a long and agonizing disease, Pedro passed on at 14:30 on 24 September 1834. As he had mentioned, his heart was put in Porto's Lapa Church and his body was buried in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza. The updates on his demise touched base in Rio de Janeiro on 20 November, yet his youngsters were educated simply after 2 December. BonifÃÂ¡cio, who had been expelled from his situation as their watchman, wrote to PedroÃÂ II and his sisters: "Dom Pedro did not bite the dust. Just conventional men kick the bucket, not legends."
