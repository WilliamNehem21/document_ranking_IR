In summer 1429, the Thessalonians sent a second consulate to Venice to grumble about the limitations set on passage and exit from the city, proceeded with infringement of their rights, blackmail by the Venetian specialists, the poor supply circumstance, the disregard of fixing the city's strongholds and the absence of military stores, and the Venetian hired fighters who were in contact with the Turks outside the dividers. On 14 July, the Great Council gave generally consoling responses to a rundown of 31 requests, yet the expanding disappointment by the Greek populace with Venetian standard was obvious. The observer John Anagnostes reports that by the winter of 1429, most of the populace had come to support a surrender to the Turks. Sultan Murad knew about the circumstance inside the dividers, and twice sent Christian officers in his administration into the city to prompt an insubordination to the Venetians. Notwithstanding, as Anagnostes composes, the populace was at that point so decreased in number, and partitioned among itself, that no regular reason could be made. Moreover, the Thessalonians feared the Venetians, as they had enlisted an exceptional power of gatekeepers, the "Tzetarioi," and given them the expert to slaughter anybody pushing a surrender.
