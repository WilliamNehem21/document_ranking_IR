"Enter the Wu-Tang" introduced another standard for hip-jump when hip bounce music was overwhelmed by the jazz-affected styles of A Tribe Called Quest, the Afrocentric perspectives of Public Enemy, and the rising prevalence of West Coast gangsta rap. The collection's express, amusing and free-cooperative verses have been acknowledged for filling in as a format for some, resulting hip jump records. "Moving Stone" portrayed the collection as having a stylish that might have been "low on publicity and creation esteems [and] high on the possibility that poverty is a focal piece of darkness." While the melodious substance on "Enter the Wu-Tang" by and large shifts from rapper to rapper, the fundamental topics are the equivalentÃ¢ÂÂurban life, combative techniques motion pictures, comic book references, and potÃ¢ÂÂand the setting is constantly the cruel condition of New York City. The verses have an all around dim tone and appear on occasion to be basically forceful cries. AllMusic benefactor Steve Huey acclaims the lyricists for their innovation and burning funniness, expressing "Some were outsized, showy identities, others were cerebral storytellers and melodious specialists, however each had his very own unmistakable styleÃÂ ... Each track on "Enter the Wu-Tang" is pressed with new, imaginative rhymes, which are loaded up with hand to hand fighting similitudes, popular culture references (everything from Voltron to Lucky Charms oat ads to Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were"), odd dangers of savagery, and a genuinely contorted comical inclination."
