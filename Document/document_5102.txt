Mitchell detailed the news to the Admiralty while Campbell came back to "Temeraire" and gathered the group on deck yet again. He encouraged them to come back to obligation, and afterward expelled them. In the interim, discipline had started to separate among the rebels.

The marines faltered, yet then complied with the request, driving the rowdy sailors back and capturing various them, who were promptly set in irons. Campbell requested the rest of the team to relinquish any mutinous activities, and denied of its pioneers, the uprising crumbled, however the officers were wary for a few days a short time later and the marines were requested to complete ceaseless watches.
