The pair were hitched in Boulogne on 25 January. Edward gave Isabella a psalter as a wedding blessing, and her dad gave her endowments worth more than 21,000 livres and a section of the True Cross. The pair came back to England in February, where Edward had requested Westminster Palace to be richly reestablished in preparation for their crowning celebration and wedding feast, total with marble tables, forty broilers and a wellspring that delivered wine and pimento, a spiced medieval beverage. After some deferrals, the function proceeded on 25 February at Westminster Abbey, under the direction of Henry Woodlock, the Bishop of Winchester. As a major aspect of the royal celebration, Edward promised to maintain "the legitimate laws and traditions which the network of the domain will have picked". It is dubious what this implied: it may have been planned to drive Edward to acknowledge future enactment, it might have been embedded to keep him from toppling any future pledges he may take, or it might have been an endeavor by the King to charm himself with the nobles. The occasion was defaced by the extensive hordes of enthusiastic observers who flooded into the castle, thumping down a divider and compelling Edward to escape by the secondary passage.
