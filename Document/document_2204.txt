De Gray was proposed, or named, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which gave Innocent two contender for the workplace. With an end goal to achieve a trade off, the pope subdued the two designations on around 30 March 1206; Innocent's explanation behind nullifying de Gray's office was that any decision was invalid if a before one was still under intrigue to the papacy. The priests at that point chose Stephen Langton, with Innocent's endorsement. John did not acknowledge Langton's office be that as it may, and Innocent's sanctification of Langton in 1207 prompted an eight-year battle among John and the pope over the privileges of his preferred lord to verify the race as ecclesiastical overseer. John wouldn't permit Langton to enter England and ousted the Canterbury priests. Guiltless put a prohibit on England in 1207, which John countered by seizing the salary and domains of any pastorate who upheld it. Honest proceeded to expel John in 1209, in a question that prompted the outcast of a significant number of the English ministry and John's inconvenience of substantial budgetary requests on the congregation in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the main living English religious administrators not in a state of banishment. Be that as it may, it was not until 1213, when Innocent started to help John's affidavit, that the lord wound up concerned and achieved a settlement with the papacy.
