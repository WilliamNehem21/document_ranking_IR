Move reacted to the relief by transforming the line of fight into cruising arrangement to build his caravan's speed with the expectation of achieving the Straits in front of Linois. With the caravan a less scary target, Linois started to gradually approach the British boats. By 13:00 plainly Linois' quicker ships were in peril of segregating the back of the escort, and Dance requested his lead boats to tack and happen, with the goal that they would cross before the French squadron. The British effectively executed the move, and at 13:15 Linois opened flame on the lead deliverÃ¢ÂÂ"Imperial George"Ã¢ÂÂ under the order of John Fam Timmins. The "Imperial George" and the following four ships in line, the Indiaman "Ganges", Dance's "Duke Camden", the "Warley" and the "Alfred", all returned flame, "Ganges" at first assaulting "Illustrious George" in blunder. Commander James Prendergrass in "Expectation", the following in line, was so anxious to join the fight that he misconceived his speed and slammed into "Warley", the boats falling back as their groups attempted to isolate their apparatus. Shots were then traded at long range for 43 minutes, neither one of the sides incurring serious harm.
