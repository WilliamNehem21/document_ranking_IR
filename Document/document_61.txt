The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams the opportunity to make the most of their "ideal toy for the mid year", another cruising vessel. The vessel had been structured by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who hosted joined the gathering in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts cruised south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley talked about with Byron and Leigh Hunt the dispatch of an extreme magazine called "The Liberal". On 8 July, he and Edward Williams set out on the arrival voyage to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never achieved their goal. A letter touched base at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, "supplicate write to reveal to us how you returned home, for they state you had awful climate after you cruised monday and we are restless". "The paper tumbled from me," Mary told a companion later. "I trembled everywhere." She and Jane Williams hurried urgently to Livorno and after that to Pisa in the blurring trust that their spouses were as yet alive. Ten days after the tempest, three bodies appeared on the coast close Viareggio, halfway among Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt incinerated Percy Shelley's body on the shoreline at Viareggio.
