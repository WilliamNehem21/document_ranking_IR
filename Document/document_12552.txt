Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar parts on the collection are interplayed around the mood area's drum hits and basslines. Their double playing draws on 1960s shake and cutting edge jazz styles, surrendering the layered power harmonies of contemporary punk shake for melodic lines and counter-songs. Verlaine's guitar builds up the tune's musical expression, against which Lloyd is heard playing conflicting songs. Lloyd had figured out how to document his performances when they recorded "Marquee Moon", enabling him to build up his performance for a tune from prologue to variety and goals. A few tunes have the two guitarists exchanging cadenced and melodic lines a few times while delivering strain. "There weren't numerous groups where the two guitars played cadence and tune forward and backward, similar to a jigsaw bewilder", Lloyd said. The greater part of the performances on "Marquee Moon" pursue an example wherein Verlaine keeps running up a noteworthy scale however relapses somewhat after each progression. On "See No Evil", he performances through a full octave before playing a blues-impacted riff, and on the title track, he is heard playing in a Mixolydian mode and bringing down the seventh significantly a stage. "Contact" opens with Lloyd playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing music and arrangement of sliding scales.
