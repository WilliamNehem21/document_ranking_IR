The milk truck upset when the men endeavored to take a corner excessively quick, and they compromised a merchant's kid before taking his conveyance truck; Lepidus drove while Helfeld sat at the back, shooting at followers. A policeman appropriated a vehicle and he, with an equipped partner, kept up interest. The truck did not travel exceptionally quick on the grounds that, unbeknown to Lepidus, its brake was still on, and one of the wheels was not working. The steed was before long spent, and the two men surrendered it, taking off by walking along the bank of the River Ching. The pathway was flanked by a - high fence and, as it proceeded, it limited to the point of being obstructed. It was past the point of no return for the men to turn back and they chose to move over; Lepidus figured out how to make it, however Helfeld, depleted by the pursuit, couldn't figure out how to climb. He yelled to Lepidus to spare himself and, as the police shut in, he put the firearm to his head and shot himself. The projectile entered the head a large portion of an inch over the correct eye and left through the brow on the opposite side. He was incapacitated before he could fire once more, and was battling as he was overwhelmed; he was taken to Tottenham Hospital.
