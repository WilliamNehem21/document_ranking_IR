Amid the High Middle Ages those in England blameworthy of treachery were rebuffed in an assortment of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the thirteenth century other, increasingly merciless punishments were presented, for example, eviscerating, consuming, decapitating and quartering. The thirteenth century English recorder Matthew Paris depicted how in 1238 "a specific man at arms, a man of some training ("armiger literatus")" endeavored to execute King Henry III. His record records in abhorrent detail how the future professional killer was executed: "hauled to shreds, at that point guillotined, and his body separated into three sections; each part was then hauled through one of the central urban communities of England, and was a short time later held tight a gibbet utilized for burglars." He was evidently sent by William de Marisco, a fugitive who a few years sooner had killed a man under illustrious security before escaping to Lundy Island. De Marisco was caught in 1242 and on Henry's structure hauled from Westminster to the Tower of London to be executed. There he was dangled from a gibbet until dead. His body was gutted, his guts consumed, his body quartered and the parts conveyed to urban communities the nation over. The discipline is all the more much of the time recorded amid Edward I's rule.
