In mid 1914, Ruth marked an expert baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who possessed and dealt with the small time Baltimore Orioles, an International League group. The conditions of Ruth's marking are not known with conviction; authentic truth is clouded by stories that can't all be valid. By certain records, Dunn was asked to go to an amusement between a top pick group from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian office, Mount St. Mary's College. A few forms have Ruth fleeing before the excitedly anticipated diversion, to return so as to be rebuffed, and after that pitching St. Mary's to triumph as Dunn viewed. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's alumni, contributing a graduated class diversion in the wake of viewing a fundamental challenge between the school's rookies and a group from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, at that point informed Dunn regarding him at a possibility meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his personal history, expressed just that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was agreed upon. As indicated by biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legitimate challenges to be fixed as Ruth should stay at the school until he turned 21.
