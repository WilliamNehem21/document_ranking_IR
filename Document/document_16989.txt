"Pathways" was a critical success. Inside Mac Games reviewer Jon Blum wrote in 1993 that "Pathways" was "one of the best Macintosh games I've ever played". "Computer Gaming World" described "Pathways" as "a dungeon crawl, pure and simple". While describing the game before obtaining a gun as "tedious" and criticizing the small number of save points per level, the magazine praised the "simple, elegant and easy to use" user interface and "excellent" graphics and sound. "Computer Gaming World" concluded that while "somewhat weak on actual game play", "Pathways" was "a job worthy of a strong recommendation". "Macworld"s Steven Levy commented that the gameplay and graphics were extremely smooth. He singled out the creatures for specific praise, likening them to "something that might have come from a brain-merge of Tim Burton, Anne Rice and Hieronymus Bosch" instead of simple line drawings. Complaints and criticisms of the game included the difficulty level; Blum found some segments too difficult and that it was possible to spend hours playing before realizing that the player had made an irreversible mistake. Jones admitted that the game was harder than he intended. The title received several awards, including Inside Mac Games' "Adventure Game of the Year" and "Macworld"s "Best Role-Playing Game", and was listed on the "MacUser" 100.
