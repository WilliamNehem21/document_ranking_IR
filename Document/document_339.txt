Van der Weyden portrays Hell as a desolate, swarmed spot of both close and far off flames, and soak shake faces. The accursed tumble vulnerably into it, shouting and crying. The miscreants plummet into Hell with heads generally bowed, hauling each other along as they go. Generally, a Last Judgment painting would delineate the accursed tormented by vindictive spirits; yet here the spirits are disregarded, the main proof that they are tormented is in their appearances. The hellscape is painted in order to ingrain dread, yet without villains. Erwin Panofsky was the first to get on this nonattendance, and recommended that van der Weyden had selected to pass on torment in an internal way, instead of through expand depictions of villains and savages. He expressed, "The destiny of every human beingÃÂ ... definitely pursues from his own past, and the nonattendance of any outside instigator of malevolence influences us to understand that the main torment of the Damned isn't so much physical agony as a ceaseless and deplorably honed awareness of their state". As per Bernhard Ridderbos, van der Weyden complemented the subject by "confining the quantity of the dead and treating them nearly as people. As the cursed methodology the pit of damnation they become increasingly compacted."
