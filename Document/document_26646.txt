Critics praised "Wipeout 2048" graphics and visuals, calling them a showcase for the PlayStation Vita's power. Cam Shea of IGN enjoyed the game's detail and depth but questioned its visual design, saying that the game's darker environments and cluttered worlds made the tracks ambiguous and less readable. Adam Goodall of Gameplanet called the graphics stunning and said that the game had a pervasive artistic statement, something he considered rare in video games (particularly racing games). According to "Digital Spy"s Mark Langshaw and GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey, the game's backdrops were superior to "Wipeout HD"; Langshaw said that they showcased the PlayStation Vita's graphical prowess. David Meikleham of the "Official PlayStation Magazine" wrote that "Wipeout 2048" "brilliantly shows off" the new hardware with its attractive lighting effects, solid frame rate and wide range of colours, and Dan Ryckert of "Game Informer" said that its fast-paced races "do a good job" of displaying the Vita's graphical capabilities. FrÃ©dÃ©ric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com liked the game's utilisation of the PlayStation Vita's OLED screen, although he saw little difference between the graphical enhancements of "Wipeout 2048" and "Wipeout HD". According to Goyon, the game was "fluid in all circumstances" and was essentially "Wipeout HD" on a smaller screen. Heath Hindman of Game Revolution said that although it "really shows off" the PlayStation Vita's graphical power (along with "Uncharted: Golden Abyss", another launch title), the game's sight distance was limited. "Wipeout 2048" track design was largely praised. Simon Parkin of "The Guardian" enjoyed its "wholly contemporary" track details and visual consistency with previous instalments, and Peter Willington of "Pocket Gamer" called the game's track design the best in the series. According to Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat, "Wipeout 2048" would have benefited from a "slightly braver" track design.
