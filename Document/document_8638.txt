When it turned out to be evident that the British would not assault the High Seas Fleet, the Germans started a progression of tasks intended to draw out piece of the numerically prevalent British Grand Fleet and wreck it. The German naval force was planning to constrain a conclusive fight in the southern part of the North Sea in the wake of accomplishing an unpleasant balance of powers. "Pommern" and the remainder of the II Battle Squadron at that point rejoined the High Seas Fleet as a major aspect of the warship support for the battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group that assaulted Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16 December 1914. The principle armada went about as far off help for "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"Ã¢ÂÂ Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's battlecruiser squadron while it attacked the beach front towns. On the night of 15 December, the armada came to inside of a secluded squadron of six British war vessels. In any case, encounters between the adversary destroyer screens in the dimness persuaded the German armada administrator, "VAdm" Friedrich von Ingenohl, that the whole Grand Fleet was conveyed before him. Compelled from Wilhelm II to maintain a strategic distance from fight if triumph was not sure, von Ingenohl severed the commitment and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany.
