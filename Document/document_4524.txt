Because of the similitudes between the Hellenistic divider canvases at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce battles that the distinctions in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the purposeful result of masterful inclination as opposed to the aftereffect of obliviousness of one another's customs. These distinctions incorporate the across the board utilization of "creation signinum" at Pompeii, with just four known models at Delos; the utilization of "creation sectile" at Pompeii and its total nonattendance at Delos; the pervasive utilization of polychrome examples and many-sided, three-dimensional figured structures in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional plans at Pompeii, which, best case scenario use two hues. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics utilizing polychrome plans to accomplish the figment of light and shadow were not created at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of divider painting (80-20 BC) and are viewed as a selection from Hellenistic craftsmanship patterns. While lead strips were utilized in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the Crimean landmass), they are missing in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian promontory. Westgate confirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be isolated into two general classes: eastern and western, in light of their diverse styles and creation procedures.
