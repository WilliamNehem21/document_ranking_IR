They needed the tunes to have slower assaults like more established accounts, as makers in the past did not have propelled blowers, sound apparatuses that control the dynamic substance of signs and influence certain sounds in a chronicle's blend. Their generation connected cylinder preamps and tube blowers, with the previous utilized as a front end for Pro Tools. For Saadiq's vocals, he utilized a Shure SM57 dynamic mouthpiece to thicken and mutilate his voice and decorate his typically perfect conveyance, while Brungardt utilized a blower and a Pro Tools module amid the blend. Saadiq looked for a specific "edge" for his vocals and an unpolished sonic component for the collection. They likewise endeavored to record tracks onto tape tapes so as to create a grittier, more seasoned sound. Brungardt utilized a FilterBank module when blending the collection to uncompress vocals and move off top of the line sound from tracks.
