As indicated by the creators of the 2011 hereditary examination by the Australian geneticist Tim H. Heupink and associates, the nearby connection between the King Island and territory emus shows that the previous populace was segregated from the last generally as of late, because of ocean level changes in the Bass Strait, rather than an establishing emu ancestry that veered from the terrain emu far prior and had in this manner become wiped out on the terrain. Models of ocean level change demonstrate that Tasmania, including King Island, was confined from the Australian terrain around 14,000 years back. Up to a few thousand years after the fact King Island was then isolated from Tasmania. This situation would recommend that a populace familial to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was at first segregated from the territory taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populaces were isolated. This thus shows the in like manner wiped out Tasmanian emu is presumably as firmly identified with the territory emu just like the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being all the more firmly identified with one another. Fossil emu taxa demonstrate a normal size between that of the King Island emu and territory emu. Henceforth, terrain emus can be viewed as an extensive or massive structure.
