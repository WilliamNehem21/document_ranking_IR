Ball at that point mentioned a couple of days off yet, sadly, was incidentally reassigned to ethereal surveillance obligation with No.ÃÂ 8 Squadron, where he flew B.E.2s from 18 July until 14 August. Amid this posting, Ball embraced a bizarre mission. On the night of 28 July, he flew a French secret activities operator crosswise over adversary lines. Evading an assault by three German warriors, just as hostile to airplane fire, he arrived in a betrayed field, just to find that the operator would not escape the air ship. While he was on observation obligations with No. 8 Squadron, the "London Gazette" declared that he had been granted the Military Cross "for obvious ability and valor on numerous events," especially for "one event [when] he assaulted six of every one flight". This was not surprising; all through his profession, Ball for the most part assaulted without hesitation and reckless of the chances. He pronounced no contempt for his adversaries, keeping in touch with his folks "I scrap since it is my dutyÃÂ ... Nothing makes me feel more spoiled than to see them go down, yet you see it is it is possible that them or me, so I should perform my responsibility best to put forth it a defense of "them"".
