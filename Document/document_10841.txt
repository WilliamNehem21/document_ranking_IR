Multi day before his abdication from Congress, "The Detroit News" revealed that in the wake of completion his presidential battle, McCotter took to composing a TV pilot he titled, "Guard Sticker: Made On Motown". It fixated on McCotter as the host of a theatrical presentation with characters dependent on his congressional staff members, who ridiculed his presidential battle and examined such naughty subjects as sex, race, and real capacities. In one scene in the content, S. E. Cupp visitor stars; McCotter attempts to direct a genuine meeting with her, yet different characters make explicitly express remarks, driving Cupp to depict the show as a "train wreck." A previous staff member discharged the work to the media to demonstrate what McCotter did while in office. Accordingly, McCotter denied any bad behavior, saying it had been to a great extent formed in his carport as an approach to get over his fizzled presidential crusade. He said the content was incomplete and had not approved it for discharge, yet chose to examine it with "The News". He refered to comic Martin Mull's brief 1977 show "Fernwood 2 Night" as a motivation, and uncovered that he had wanted to leave Congress in 2014 and was getting ready for a future vocation.
