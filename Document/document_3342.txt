Having served at No.ÃÂ 1 Flying Training School (No.ÃÂ 1 FTS), Point Cook, since entering the RAAF, Bostock was presented on Britain in 1926 to go to RAF Staff College, Andover. While there he was rebuked by the school's commandant, by means of letter, because of the specific school he had decided for his little girl and in light of the fact that he did his very own planting; Bostock was said to have restored the letter stamped "noted and disregarded". On his arrival to Australia as a squadron chief in 1928, he assumed responsibility for No.ÃÂ 1 FTS, and moved toward becoming Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in December 1929. From 1931 to 1936 Bostock was leader (CO) of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron, flying Westland Wapitis and, later, Hawker Demons. At the time, his situation as No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron administrator served as CO of the unit's base, RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. A wing administrator from 1934, he was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honors on 31ÃÂ May 1935. Following a two-year posting in Britain on the staff of No. 1 Bomber Group, Bostock was elevated to assemble chief on 1ÃÂ September 1938 and made Director of Operations and Intelligence. Inside a year he had progressed toward becoming Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.
