Writer and supervising producer Brad Kern reflected on the show's cancellation, saying, "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I think that was the biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." Told of the show's success in the "TV Guide" "Save Our Shows" poll, Sandy Grushow said, "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." Kim Manners, director on nearly a third of the "Brisco" episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for "Brisco" was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on "The X-Files". Manners said, "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on "Brisco". Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, "Brisco" could have had a much longer life." Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt "Brisco"s chances of building an audience, saying, "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slotÂ â I mean people do still go bowlingÂ â few shows have succeeded in that slot."
