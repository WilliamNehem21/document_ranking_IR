In spite of the accommodation of the English nobles, opposition proceeded for quite a long while. William left control of England in the hands of his stepbrother Odo and one of his nearest supporters, William fitzOsbern. In 1067 radicals in Kent propelled an ineffective assault on Dover Castle in mix with Eustace II of Boulogne. The Shropshire landowner Eadric the Wild, in union with the Welsh leaders of Gwynedd and Powys, brought a revolt up in western Mercia, battling Norman powers situated in Hereford. These occasions constrained William to come back to England toward the finish of 1067. In 1068 William assaulted revolts in Exeter, including Harold's mom Gytha, and in the wake of enduring substantial misfortunes figured out how to arrange the town's surrender. In May, William's significant other Matilda was delegated ruler at Westminster, a vital image of William's developing global stature. Later in the year Edwin and Morcar brought a revolt up in Mercia with Welsh help, while Gospatric, the recently named Earl of Northumbria, drove an ascending in Northumbria, which had not yet been involved by the Normans. These uprisings quickly crumbled as William moved against them, building manors and introducing battalions as he had effectively done in the south. Edwin and Morcar again submitted, while Gospatric fled to Scotland, as did Edgar the ÃÂtheling and his family, who may have been associated with these rebellions. In the interim, Harold's children, who had taken shelter in Ireland, struck Somerset, Devon and Cornwall from the ocean.
