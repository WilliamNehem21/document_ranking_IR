On 13 November 1996 the day the first subpoenaed USAF officer was planned to show up, the DoD conveyed a letter to Roth, marked by its general guidance, Judith Miller, expressing that the DoD trusted the subpoenas were invalid since they were issued "after the suspension of "sine pass on" of the 104th Congress" and was in this way not going to respect the subpoenas by giving the four officers to meet. Roth answered to the DoD that just the Senate's legitimate advice could decide the legitimacy of congressional subpoenas in view of the "detachment of forces" guideline in the U.S. Constitution and in this manner, the subpoenas were substantial. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter marked by Miller again would not deliver the observers. Roth, whose council chairmanship was booked to end the following month, was told by the U.S. Bureau of Justice that the U.S. Lawyer General, Janet Reno, would not bolster him on the off chance that he took the question with the DoD to court. Likewise, a significant number of Roth's senate associates, including John McCain, were requesting that he "back off". Along these lines, Roth chose to drop the issue and keep setting up the report without the declaration of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. Without precedent for U.S. history, the DoD had would not consent to a U.S. Senate subpoena.
