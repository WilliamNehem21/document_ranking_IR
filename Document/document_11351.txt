The vital worry amid the harvest time and winter months was Wagner's declining wellbeing; his heart fits had turned out to be frequent to the point that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded: "Today he did "not" have a fit!". Cosima's diary passage for 12 February 1883Ã¢ÂÂthe last she was to makeÃ¢ÂÂrecords Wagner perusing FouquÃÂ©'s tale "Undine", and playing the Rhinemaidens' regret from "Das Rheingold" on the piano.

As per Isolde, reviewing the event a lot later, the Pringle doubts prompted an enraged column among Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February.
