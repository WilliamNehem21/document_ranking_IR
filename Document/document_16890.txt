The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of "Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth" (the "DOGS" case), in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene SectionÂ 116. Chief Justice Garfield Barwick held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its "express and single purpose", while Justice Harry Gibbs argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion. Each justice in the majority contrasted SectionÂ 116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that SectionÂ 116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting "establishment of religion" generally, whereas the prohibition in SectionÂ 116 is against the establishment of ""any" religion": this meant that SectionÂ 116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion. The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of SectionÂ 116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars John Quick and Robert Garran in 1901, that establishment means "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others."
