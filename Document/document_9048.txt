Garfield's arrangement of James enraged Conkling, a factional rival of the Postmaster General, who requested a compensatory arrangement for his group, for example, the situation of Secretary of the Treasury. The subsequent quarrel involved quite a bit of Garfield's concise administration. The quarrel with Conkling achieved a peak when the president, at Blaine's actuation, assigned Conkling's foe, Judge William H. Robertson, to be Collector of the Port of New York. This was one of the prize support positions beneath bureau level, and was then held by Edwin A. Merritt. Conkling raised the noble rule of senatorial kindness trying to vanquish the designation, without much of any result. Garfield, who trusted the training was degenerate, would not withdraw and took steps to pull back all assignments except if Robertson was affirmed, planning to "settle the inquiry whether the president is enlisting assistant of the Senate or the Executive of the United States." Ultimately, Conkling and his New York partner, Senator Thomas C. Platt, surrendered their Senate seats to look for vindication, however discovered possibly further embarrassment when the New York council chose others in their places. Robertson was affirmed as Collector and Garfield's triumph was clear. To Blaine's vexation, the successful Garfield came back to his objective of adjusting the interests of gathering groups, and assigned some of Conkling's Stalwart companions to workplaces.
