Smith and Wilson gained little ground towards a settlement amid 1964 and 1965; each blamed the other for being preposterous. The RF won a conclusive triumph in the May 1965 general decision. After endeavors to produce a trade off in London toward the beginning of October 1965 fizzled, Wilson, edgy to deflect UDI, headed out to Salisbury soon thereafter to proceed with exchanges. Beadle's "unstoppable resourcefulness prompted a unimaginable progression of recommendations for a settlement", Wilson reviewed, yet these discussions additionally fizzled. The opposite sides concurred on an investigatory Royal Commission, potentially led by Beadle, to suggest a way towards freedom, yet couldn't settle on the terms. Beadle kept on looking for a trade off, and on 8 November induced Smith to enable him to go to London to meet Wilson once more. Beadle revealed to Wilson that he thought Smith was by and by arranged to proceed with talks yet under strain from a portion of his pastors to surrender exchanges. Wilson told the British House of Commons that Beadle had given "shrewd exhortation" to the two governments, and was "welcome [in] this nation for his wisdom, judgment, and humankind yet as a man with the valor of a lion."
