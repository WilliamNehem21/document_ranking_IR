At about this time, adding to pressure from the popularity of the "Vachana" canon in the northern Kannada-speaking region, the noted Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana (1108â1152) of the southern Kannada-speaking region converted from Jainism to the Hindu sect of Vaishnavism. The popularity of Ramanujacharya's philosophy had spread in the Hoysala lands and Srivaishnavism, a sub-sect of Vaishnavism, was in the ascendant. By the late 13th century, the Veerashaiva writers, who were by now writing allegorical inscriptions and biographies of famous "Vachanakaras" of the 12th century, were in stiff competition with the Jains. The earliest attempts by the Jains to veer away from traditional "puranic" (philosophical) themes of renunciation are seen in the writings of Hoysala writers Nemichandra and Andayya. "Lilavati Prabhandam", a novel written by Nemichandra (1170) on the topic of love, erotica, and of the victory of Kamadeva (god of love) over his arch-rival Shiva, is the first among such writings. It was followed by "Kabbigara Kava" ("Poets defender", 1215â1237) by Andayya, also a work depicting a war between Kamadeva and the god Shiva. Despite these efforts, the Jain literary influence was to recede in the coming decades and centuries, being relegated mostly to the coastal Kannada-speaking region. Works of enduring quality were still produced by maverick authors such as Ratnakaravarni (1557), though their numbers were fewer.
