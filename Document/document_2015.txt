The succession of occasions that prompted Somerset's expulsion from power has frequently been known as a "rebellion". By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been cautioned that his standard confronted a genuine risk. He issued a decree calling for help, claimed the ruler's individual, and pulled back for security to the invigorated Windsor Castle, where Edward expressed, "Me supposes I am in jail". Then, an assembled Council distributed subtleties of Somerset's administration botch. They clarified that the Protector's capacity originated from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the Council had Somerset captured and conveyed the ruler to Richmond. Edward abridged the charges against Somerset in his "Annal": "aspiration, vainglory, going into rash wars in mine childhood, careless looking on Newhaven, advancing himself of my fortune, following his very own conclusion, and doing all by his own power, and so on." In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, developed as the pioneer of the Council and, essentially, as Somerset's successor. In spite of the fact that Somerset was discharged from the Tower and reestablished to the Council, he was executed for lawful offense in January 1552 in the wake of plotting to topple Dudley's routine. Edward noticed his uncle's passing in his "Annal": "the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill somewhere in the range of eight and nine o'clock toward the beginning of the day".
