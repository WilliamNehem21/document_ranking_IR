Following Starlite third Battalion kept on directing customary breadths and low-level (for example little unit) battle activities against the Viet Cong (normally the first VC Regiment) in the more prominent Da Nang region. Among the losses endured amid this period was LtCol Muir, who was slaughtered when he ventured on an IED. In November they took part in a land and/or water capable activity like Starlite called Blue Marlin (II), which was done close Hoi An. Contact was unpredictable as the VC endeavored to maintain a strategic distance from a drawn-out commitment and the legion just had three Marines injured. At that point in December the contingent moved to the Que Son Valley for Operation Harvest Moon, keeping the VC from catching the town. In March 1966, third Battalion took part in Operation Kings, authoritatively a pursuit and obliterate mission in the A Hoa locale, yet extremely an endeavor to make a long haul occupation in a notable Viet Cong fortress. Be that as it may, any advancement picked up in Kings was promptly nullified by the Buddhist Uprising only multi week later in Da Nang. In July, the legion went about as a blocking power amid Operation Macon however did not see critical activity. In August, third Battalion left Vietnam for Okinawa. The legion would not be gone long however, and toward the beginning of October was positioned seaward as BLT 3/3 close to the northern part of I Corps to battle a conceivable North Vietnamese attack over the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The danger never appeared and BLT 3/3 came back to Vietnam soon thereafter.
