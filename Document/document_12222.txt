On 31 July 1867 the Claimant experienced a legal examination at the Chancery Division of the Royal Courts of Justice. He affirmed that after his entry in Melbourne in July 1854 he had worked for William Foster at a cows station in Gippsland under the name of Thomas Castro. While there, he had met Arthur Orton, a kindred Englishman. In the wake of leaving Foster's business the Claimant had in this way meandered the nation, some of the time with Orton, working in different limits before setting up as a butcher in Wagga in 1865. Based on this data, the Tichborne family sent an operator, John Mackenzie, to Australia to make further enquiries. Mackenzie found Foster's widow, who created the old station records. These demonstrated no reference to "Thomas Castro", in spite of the fact that the work of an "Arthur Orton" was recorded. Cultivate's widow additionally distinguished a photo of the Claimant as Arthur Orton, hence giving the main direct proof that the Claimant may in reality be Orton. In Wagga one nearby occupant reviewed the butcher Castro saying that he had taken in his exchange Wapping. At the point when this data achieved London, enquiries were made in Wapping by a private criminologist, ex-police controller Jack Whicher, and the Claimant's visit in December 1866 was uncovered.
