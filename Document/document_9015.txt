The Jin administration had not expected or wanted the fall of the Song tradition. Their expectation was to debilitate the Song so as to request more tribute, and they were caught off guard for the greatness of their triumph. The Jurchens were engrossed with reinforcing their standard over the zones once constrained by Liao. Rather than proceeding with their intrusion of the Song, a domain with a military that dwarfed their own, they received the system of "utilizing Chinese to control the Chinese". The Jin trusted an intermediary state would be equipped for overseeing northern China and gathering the yearly repayment without requiring Jurchen intercessions to suppress against Jin uprisings. In 1127, the Jurchens introduced a previous Song official, Zhang Bangchang (Ã¥Â¼ÂµÃ©ÂÂ¦Ã¦ÂÂ; 1081Ã¢ÂÂ 1127), as manikin sovereign of the recently settled "Da Chu" (Great Chu) administration. The manikin government did not stop the opposition in northern China, however the radicals were spurred by their displeasure towards the Jurchens' plundering as opposed to by a feeling of devotion towards the uncouth Song court. Various Song authorities, positioned in towns dissipated crosswise over northern China, held their loyalty to the Song, and furnished volunteers composed state armies contradicted to the Jurchen military nearness. The revolt hampered the capacity of the Jin to apply power over the north.
