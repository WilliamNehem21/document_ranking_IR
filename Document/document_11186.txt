Birkett turned into a mainstream barrier counsel, something that every so often caused him inconvenience; he was once compelled to reject a litigant's solicitation to go about as his agent on the grounds that Birkett was normal in an alternate court. He awed the Bench in Birmingham such a great amount of that, in 1919, he was exhorted by a nearby Circuit Judge to move to London to propel his profession. In spite of the fact that he was at first reluctant, saying that "rivalry in London is on a significant diverse scale, and in the event that I bombed there, I would have lost all that I have developed here", a case he took in 1920 changed the circumstance. He went about as a lesser for the indictment in the purported Green Bicycle Case against Edward Marshall-Hall. In spite of the fact that he lost, he adequately inspired Marshall-Hall for the last to offer him a spot in his chambers in London. He had no associations with the specialists in London, and the representative at his new loads got around this absence of contacts by utilizing him as insight in cases including Marshall-Hall, who as a King's Counsel could show up in court just when joined by a lesser lawyer, for example, Birkett.
