The meerkat Flower is conceived in the Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, the pioneer of a meerkat bunch called the Whiskers. After an assault by an adversary gathering, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are compelled to surrender their domain and move to another home. A bird of prey executes Holly when Flower is a year old, and her dad forsakes the gathering to locate another mate. Bloom's sister Viale turns into the gathering's female authority and picks Youssarian, a meandering male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Blossom mates with Yossarian's sibling, Zaphod, yet Viale slaughters the subsequent puppies and expels Flower from the gathering, enabling her to return later. Amid a period of starvation and dry spell, Viale endeavors to lead the gathering over a street to rummage. As she crosses, she is struck and executed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers endeavor to change in accordance with the loss of their pioneer, a snake approaches the gathering. Bloom ventures in to lead an assault to drive it off. In doing as such, she turns into the new pioneer of the gathering. Zaphod comes back to the gathering to be her mate, while Yossarian moves to one side and leaves the gathering. Blossom drives the Whiskers back to their unique home, and after a short fight, the Whiskers recover it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note depicts Flower's passing amid the third period of "Meerkat Manor" and the kids she abandoned.
