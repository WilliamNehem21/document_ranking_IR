The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, headquartered in Chicago, enlisted Haynes as their field administrator in 1890 after the organization's top managerial staff "found that Elwood Haynes find out about gaseous petrol than anybody in the state". He and his significant other moved to Greentown where he managed the development of the organization's initially siphoning wells. The organization intended to develop a petroleum gas line from eastern Indiana to Chicago, a separation of over , which would be the main long-remove flammable gas pipeline worked in the United States. Haynes directed the plan and development periods of the task. As a result of the length of the line and the temperature changes between the two points, dampness in the flammable gas dense on the pipe, and amid colder occasions would solidify the channels in certain areas. The issue was a huge mishap to the task, which needed to quit siphoning amid the winter months. Haynes tackled the issue by making a refrigeration gadget that would cause the dampness (which was a weakened type of gas) to gather, stop, and fall into a repository. These gadgets were introduced between the fundamental lines and siphoning stations and successfully expelled all the dampness from the gaseous petrol before it was siphoned into the lines. This avoided water development in the funnels and enabled the channels to be utilized all year. The idea was a noteworthy development in early refrigeration innovation and was additionally created by others in later years.
