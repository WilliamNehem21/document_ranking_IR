In the mid 1990s, he lived with individual performing artist Jerome Flynn and earned cash by marking fan mail for the fruitful star of "Warrior Soldier". In his presentation highlight film, "Hear My Song" (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a battling dramatic specialist and companion of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A "New York Times" pundit expressed, "the cheerful, dazed Mr. Nesbitt, figures out how to consolidate profoundness with shrewd cleverness". The commendation he got made him confident and smug; in 2001, he reviewed, "When I heard "My Song", I vanished so far up my own arse a short time later. I thought, 'Gracious, that is it, I've broken it.' And I'm happy that occurred, in light of the fact that you at that point discover how extra performers are." His frame of mind let him well enough alone for labor for a half year after the film was discharged. Until 1994, he blended his stage jobs with supporting jobs on TV in scenes of "Shelter", "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", "Covington Cross", "Lovejoy", and "Between the Lines". In 1993, he showed up in "Adoration Lies Bleeding", a portion of the BBC collection arrangement "Screenplay" and his first appearance in a generation coordinated by Michael Winterbottom; he later showed up in "Go Now" (1995), "Jude" (1996) and "Welcome to Sarajevo" (1997). A "Watchman" columnist composed that "he showed himself to be a liberal supporting on-screen character" in "Jude" and "Sarajevo".
