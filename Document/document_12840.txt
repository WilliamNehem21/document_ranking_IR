In 2013 a Channel 4 narrative utilized legal inspectors who digitized the first nitrate film from the three cameras present. The film was carefully cleaned and analyzed. Their examination proposes that Davison planned to toss a suffragette banner around the neck of a pony or append it to the steed's harness. A banner was assembled from the course; this was set available to be purchased and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the steed dashing antiquarian and creator of a past filled with the 1913 Derby, questions the validness of the thing. Sotheby's, the closeout house who sold it, depict it as a band that might have been "rumored" to have been worn by Davison. The vender expressed that her dad, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's pursuit of records indicates Burton was recorded as a dock worker two weeks before the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course upon the arrival of the Derby was Henry Mayson Dorling. At the point when the police recorded Davison's assets, they ordered the two banners given by the WSPU, both collapsed up and stuck to within her coat. They gauged 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69ÃÂ cm); the band showed at the Houses of Parliament estimates 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30ÃÂ cm).
