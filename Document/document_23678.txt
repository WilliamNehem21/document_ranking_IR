In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan's performance copyright was never in force, "Pinafore" continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies. "The New York Times", in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat New York Hippodrome a "royal entertainment [that] comes up smiling". The opera had been turned into a "mammoth spectacle" with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour. Buttercup made her entrance by rowing over to the three-masted "Pinafore", and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash. The "Times" praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs to be "shouted". The production took some liberties, including interpolated music from other Sullivan works. The paper concluded, "the mild satire of "Pinafore" is entertaining because it is universal". The same newspaper deemed Winthrop Ames' popular Broadway productions of "Pinafore" in the 1920s and 1930s "spectacular". Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received. "The New York Times" review of The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players' 2008 season at New York City Center commented, "Gilbert's themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated. But the lasting appeal of "Pinafore" and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan's generous supply of addictive melodies."
