Cladistic investigation of morphological characters recommend that "Pennatomys" is most firmly identified with a clade, the "Nectomys" subclade, that incorporates individuals from "Aegialomys", "Amphinectomys", "Nectomys", "Sigmodontomys", "Melanomys", "Megalomys" (another Antillean rice rodent), and conceivably "Nesoryzomys". In any case, the careful position of "Pennatomys" was inadequately settled on account of missing information. Turvey and partners put "P.ÃÂ nivalis" as the main individual from its very own sort on account of its particular characters and the nonattendance of proof for cozy associations with some other oryzomyine family. "Pennatomys" likely has a place with a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as "clade D". This clade contains various species just happening on islandsÃ¢ÂÂincluding individuals from "Aegialomys", "Megalomys", "Nesoryzomys", "Noronhomys", "Oryzomys", and "Pennatomys". Turvey and partners proposed this is identified with the high extent of semiaquatic species in clade DÃ¢ÂÂmost different oryzomyines are backwoods inhabitants. In general, Oryzomyini incorporates over a hundred animal types in around thirty genera. It is one of a few clans inside the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which incorporates many different types of for the most part little rodents, conveyed essentially in Eurasia and the Americas. Anyway DNA investigation exhibited a sister-taxa association with "Megalomys" as an endemic Lesser Antillean radiation inside clade D, and furthermore demonstrated that the distinctive island populaces demonstrated a high level of hereditary separation from one another.
