Cibber answered for the most part with affableness to Pope's slanders ("some of which are in obviously terrible taste", as Lowe calls attention to), until 1742 when he reacted in kind in "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, asking into the thought processes that may initiate him in his Satyrical Works, to be so much of the time partial to Mr. Cibber's name". In this flyer, Cibber's best ammo originated from a reference in Pope's "Epistle to Arbuthnot" (1735) to Cibber's "prostitute", which gave Cibber an appearance for countering in kind with a shameful tale about Pope in a house of ill-repute. "I should possess", composed Cibber, "that I trust I know a greater amount of your whoring than you do of mine; since I don't remember that ever I made you minimal Confidence of my Amours, however I have been exceptionally almost an Eye-Witness of Yours." Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked because of a tubercular disease of the spine he contracted when youthful, Cibber respected the possibility of Pope with a lady as something diverting, and he talks mockingly of the "infinitesimal masculinity" of Pope. For once the laughers were Cibber's ally, and the story "raised a general yell of cheer to Pope's detriment". Pope made no immediate answer, however took a standout amongst the most celebrated retributions in abstract history. In the reconsidered "Dunciad" that showed up in 1743, he changed his legend, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.
