Several songs on "New York Dolls" function as what Robert Hilburn deemed "colorful, if exaggerated, expressions of teen alienation". According to Robert Christgau, because many of Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs like the band could "capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being". "Private World", an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said "Frankenstein (Orig.)" was about "how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each otherÂ ... it's a love song." Its titular monster was interpreted by critic Frank Kogan to be the personification of New York and its ethosâ"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear"âwhile Johansen asking listeners if they "could make it with Frankenstein" involved more than sexual slang: "David was asking if youâif Iâcould make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster." Sylvain jokingly said "Frankenstein" was titled with the parenthetical qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his song of the same name before the band could record their own: "Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live showÂ ... Now, his thing didn't sound at all like ours, but I'm sure he stole our title."
