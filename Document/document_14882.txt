Fans were welcome to submit recommendations for the group's name which would be casted a ballot on by a gathering that included nearby games essayists and region artists. Among the finalists were "Stars", "Notes", "Hits", "Strings", "Kats", "Pickers", and "Vols". The picked name, "Sounds", is a play on the expression "Nashville sound", a subgenre of American blue grass music that follows its underlying foundations to the region in the late-1950s. The group's wordmark and shading plan were lifted from the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association (ABA), who utilized them from 1974 to 1975. At the point when the ABA converged with the National Basketball Association in 1976, a portion of the copyrights were permitted to pass, and Nashville's baseball crew received the relinquished plan. The shading blue was added to Memphis' red and white palette. Nashville's unique logo, which was utilized from 1978 into 1998, and was at first portrayed by Schmittou, mirrored the city's relationship with the blue grass music industry. It delineated a mustachioed baseball player, nicknamed "Slugger", swinging at a baseball with a guitar, a staple of down home music, instead of a bat. Further delineating the city's melodic ties was the typeface, with letters that took after G-clefs, used to show the group name and the top logo which looked like an eighth note.
