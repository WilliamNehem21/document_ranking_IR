Pete Schulberg of "The Oregonian" wrote, "Forget all the commotion about "NYPD Blue". "Homicide" delivers without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence in a most compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." Bob Wisehart of "The Sacramento Bee" said, "The bottom line is that while "NYPD Blue" is a fine show â it was on my 10-best list for 1993 â "Homicide" is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of "Hill Street Blues"." Elaine Liner, television critic with the "Corpus Christi Caller-Times", who called "Homicide" "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from "NYPD Blue", and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of "The Boston Globe" wrote, "If [the nudity] is what it took to get you to watch "NYPD Blue" and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that "Homicide" is so far superior to "NYPD Blue" in all those categories that if you're not [watching it], you're missing the best hour of episodic television since "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere" left the air."
