Among mainstream critics in the US and UK, the film received almost exclusively positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of 48 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.9 out of 10. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 82 based on 24 reviews. Almost all local and national film critics in the United States said the film presented a "riveting narrative", but conceded that it was a biased account of the events.
Frank Scheck, writing in "The Hollywood Reporter", said the film presented an enthralling story that "resembles a tautÂ ... political thriller", and Roger Ebert in the "Chicago Sun-Times" called it a "remarkable documentary" full of "astonishing shots". Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace with Ebert calling that aspect "unique in film history". Although Ebert was generally very praising of the film, he criticised the way in which ChÃ¡vez's opponents were portrayed, while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's "brevity and succinctness". In "Variety", Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a "superior example of fearless filmmakers in exactly the right place at the right time", and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America. He had praise for the camera work and editing, and said the film was a "startling record" that reached "another level" when events shifted to the presidential palace. He cited these scenesâalong with those of the protesters' clashingâas ones that "spark with a vibrant tension and uncertainty".
