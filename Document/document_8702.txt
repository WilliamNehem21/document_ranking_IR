Toward the finish of his monolog, Colbert presented what he described as a "tryout" video to turn into the new White House Press SecretaryÃ¢ÂÂScott McClellan had as of late left the position. The video grafted clasps of troublesome inquiries from the White House press corps with reactions from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's platform included controls stamped "launch", "Gannon" (a reference to recent White House correspondent Jeff Gannon, who was associated with making planted inquiries), and "volume", which he used to quietness a basic inquiry from writer David Gregory. The video proceeded with Colbert escaping the preparation room and the White House, just to be sought after by White House journalist Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal faultfinder of the Bush organization. At a certain point, Colbert gets a crisis telephone and clarifies that Thomas "won't quit inquiring as to why we attacked Iraq". The dispatcher reacts with, "Hello, why "did" we attack Iraq?" The whole second 50% of the video is a farce of blood and gore movie banalities, especially the film "Westworld", with exaggerated music going with Thomas' moderate, unfaltering quest for Colbert, and Colbert noisily shouting "No!" at interims. Broadly accessible on the web, a segment of the counterfeit tryout tape circulated on "The Colbert Report" on May 2, 2006.
