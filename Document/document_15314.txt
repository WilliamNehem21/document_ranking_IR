Bennett blamed part of "The Final Frontier"s failure on the change from a traditional Thanksgiving-season "Star Trek" opening, to the sequel-stuffed summer release period, and the diffusion of "Star Trek" fan viewership following the premiere of "The Next Generation". Winter felt they should have recognized the film's plot was too reminiscent of V'ger from "" and that the search for God was a mistake; while he felt many parts of the film were good, they "smoked [their] own press releases" and nearly killed the franchise. Initially, Shatner believed that the film would get a positive response. In the morning after the opening night, he woke Nimoy up to tell him that the "Los Angeles Times" had given "The Final Frontier" a positive review. Soon after a local television reporter also gave the film a good review, and Shatner recalled that he incorrectly "began sensing a [positive] trend". He later agreed that the film nearly ended the film series, and looking back on the film called it a "failed but glorious attempt" at a thought-provoking film that did not come together. "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry considered elements of this film to be "apocryphal at best", and particularly disliked the idea that Sarek had fathered a child (Sybok) with a Vulcan before Amanda. Nevertheless, the film is considered canon. Even George Takei expected the film to be a disappointment because "the script seemed rather a muddle...as if three separately interesting stories force-sealed together into one" which "made for a confusing and ultimately tiresome two hours".
