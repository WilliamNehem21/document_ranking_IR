El Greco did not plan to settle for all time in Toledo, since his last point was to win the support of Philip and positively shape his court. Without a doubt, he managed to verify two imperative commissions from the ruler: "Moral story of the Holy League" and "Suffering of St. Maurice". Be that as it may, the ruler disliked these works and put the St Maurice altarpiece in the part house as opposed to the proposed sanctuary. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The precise explanations behind the lord's disappointment stay vague. A few researchers have recommended that Philip disliked the consideration of living people in a religious scene; some others that El Greco's works abused a fundamental standard of the Counter-Reformation, to be specific that in the picture the substance was central instead of the style. Philip took a nearby enthusiasm for his aesthetic payments, and had extremely chosen tastes; a long looked for after etched Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini additionally neglected to satisfy when it arrived, and was moreover ousted to a less conspicuous spot. Philip's next examination, with Federico Zuccari was even less fruitful. Regardless, Philip's disappointment finished any expectations of regal support El Greco may have had.
