James' novella "The Turn of the Screw" has been greatly broke down in scholastic writing, and, given that it has been as often as possible reinterpreted in expressions of the human experience, exchange of a considerable lot of the adjustments has discovered a spot in the scholarly writing on Henry James and neo-Victorian culture. Thinking about the edge story of the film, Anna Viola Sborgi, an abstract scholar, contends that the way that Ann starts the film in a sanatorium passes on the feeling that the character is frantic, bringing about lost equivocalness. Subsequently, the film is left less an awfulness story and more a suspenseful thrill ride. Sborgi contends that the film is expressly made mental through specific story and visual decisions; for instance, Miles shows up at the train station in a phantom like manner through a haze of steam. The way that the film is a spine chiller, she contends, is additionally communicated using a montage of pictures before the opening scene. Be that as it may, the utilization of horrendous symbolism (counting an open grave) in the montage "highlight[s] the inconsistency inborn in this rendering of the novella": while the story is introduced as mental, the watcher is regardless drawn into the film as a loathsomeness story. Other than the atypical edge account, Sborgi considers the adjustment genuinely traditional with respect to both setting and ensemble.
