The Dutch green political scholar Marcel Wissenburg and the American green political scholar David Schlosberg composed a workshop entitled "Political Animals and Animal Politics" at the 2012 European Consortium for Political Research Joint Sessions meeting, which was held at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, somewhere in the range of 10 and 15 April 2012. The two had been talking for around a year about arranging a gathering extensively on the subject of "nature, creatures and political hypothesis". The workshop expected to fill a hole in the political writing on the status of nonhuman creatures, something, they guaranteed, recently thought to be just at the edges of work generally about nature/asset the executives, or else by those all the more principally intrigued by good issues. Both Wissenburg and Schlosberg introduced papers; papers were likewise displayed by Manuel Arias-Maldonado (University of Granada), Susan Boonman-Berson (Wageningen University and Research), Kurtis Boyer (Lund University), Clemens Driessen (Utrecht University), Chad Flanders (Saint Louis University), Robert Garner (University of Leicester), Margareta Hanes (Vrije Universiteit Brussel), Paul Lucardie (University of Groningen), Christopher Neff (University of Sydney), Kaspar Ossenblok (Ghent University), Simon Otjes (Leiden University), Christie Smith (University of Exeter), Mihnea Tanasescu (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Catherine Zwetkoff (University of LiÃÂ¨ge). For Schlosberg, the workshop, and the wide scope of papers exhibited, outlined the "transitioning of creature legislative issues as a subfield of political hypothesis".
