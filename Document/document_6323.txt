In 1950, Silberkleit brought back "Future", under the title "Future Combined with Science Fiction Stories"; this permitted Silberkleit to keep the rights to both the titles. The principal issue was dated May/June 1950. In January 1952 the title changed to simply "Future Science Fiction Stories". Installment rates around then were one to three pennies for each word. In the mid year of 1953, with "Future" still in mash design, Silberkleit issued a solitary condensation measured magazine with no number and no date, under the title "Sci-fi Stories". Another issue with a similar configuration and title followed in the spring of 1954, additionally unnumbered. Silberkleit chose that the condensation group was somewhat in charge of the great offers of these exploratory issues, so he changed the organization of "Future" from mash to process. The principal issue in the new configuration was dated January 1955, and in light of peruser criticism the title was changed to "Sci-fi Stories". The volume numbering was proceeded from the current "Future" volume numbering, notwithstanding the way that the title was taken from "Sci-fi", the prior magazine. Convoluting matters, Silberkleit chose later in 1955 that the market could bolster the two titles, so he resuscitated "Future" once more. Since "Sci-fi Stories" was utilizing the volume numbering from the past mash group manifestation of "Future", Silberkleit changed to an issue number configuration, with no volume. The primary issue was numbered 28, including forward from the May/June 1950 issue as 1.
