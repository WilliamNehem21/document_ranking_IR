The name connected to the expressway was not without discussion. The Lansing City Council named it in September 1966 after Ralph W. Crego, a previous city gathering part and the longest-serving city hall leader in the city's history. The Historical Society of Greater Lansing needed it named the "R.E. Olds Expressway", partially in light of the fact that the new street achieved the destruction of the Olds Mansion, which was recorded on the National Register of Historic Places, and to "recogniz[e] the commitments of R.E. Olds to the businesses of the city." The general public moved toward the Michigan Legislature, which presented House ResolutionÃÂ 48 in February 1970 utilizing the recorded society's favored name. The city committee understood that they had been avoided and helpfully found that their unique goals was not "formally received". They named a recreation center for Crego rather in October 1970 and received a goals to name I-496 the "Oldsmobile Expressway". The Legislature affirmed its goals bringing about two names, one for the organizer of the vehicle organization, and one for the organization itself. The chamber part who presented the city's goals scrutinized the Legislature for making a move without meeting. The state goals was caught before it could be sent to the Michigan Department of State Highways, and the turnpike opened on December 18, 1970, with the "Oldsmobile Expressway" name. On August 21, 1972, amid the festivals for the 75th commemoration of Oldsmobile, Senate Concurrent ResolutionÃÂ 345 renamed I-496 the "R.E. Olds Freeway".
