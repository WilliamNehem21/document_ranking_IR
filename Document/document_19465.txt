Tchaikovsky finished his final revision of "Romeo and Juliet" in 1880, and felt it a courtesy to send a copy of the score to Balakirev. Balakirev, however, had dropped out of the music scene in the early 1870s and Tchaikovsky had lost touch with him. He asked the publisher Bessel to forward a copy to Balakirev. A year later Balakirev replied. In the same letter that he thanked Tchaikovsky profusely for the score, Balakirev suggested "the programme for a symphony which you would handle wonderfully well", a detailed plan for a symphony based on Lord Byron's "Manfred". Originally drafted by Stasov in 1868 for Hector Berlioz as a sequel to that composer's "Harold en Italie", the program had since been in Balakirev's care.
Tchaikovsky declined the project at first, saying the subject left him cold. Balakirev persisted. "You must, of course, "make an effort"", Balakirev exhorted, "take a more self-critical approach, don't hurry things". Tchaikovsky's mind was changed two years later, in the Swiss Alps, while tending to his friend Iosif Kotek and after he had re-read "Manfred" in the milieu in which the poem is set. Once he returned home, Tchaikovsky revised the draft Balakirev had made from Stasov's program and began sketching the first movement.
