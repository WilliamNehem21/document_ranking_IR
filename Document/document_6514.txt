NojpetÃÂ©n tumbled to a Spanish ambush on 13 March 1697, over 150 years after the triumph of the remainder of the YucatÃÂ¡n Peninsula and over 160 years after the success of the Guatemalan Highlands. The extensive deferral in vanquishing the PetÃÂ©n locale was because of a mix of its topographical remoteness and inhospitality and the savage notoriety of its Maya occupants. Amid this time the Itza utilized the Yalain as an eastern cradle against Spanish methodology from Belize. The long roundabout contact between the Itza and the Spanish trespassers enabled the Itza to build up a comprehension of Spanish procedure and strategies that was sharpened over the time of very nearly two centuries that the Itza were encompassed by European-ruled domains. This understanding recognized the triumph of PetÃÂ©n from the sixteenth century victories of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. Conversely, the Spanish had an exceptionally poor comprehension of the Itza and their neighbors and saw them as oblivious savages whose kingdom was shielded by Satan from the Christianising endeavors of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that HernÃÂ¡n CortÃÂ©s crossed PetÃÂ©n in the mid sixteenth century, the Spanish erroneously trusted the lord of the Itza (the "Aj Kan Ek"') was the overlord of the whole focal PetÃÂ©n area.
