In Nevada, USÂ 50 was built mostly along the route of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway in the United States, formed in 1913. Through Nevada, the route of the Lincoln Highway had been previously used by the Pony Express, an early attempt at an express mail service, started in 1860. The Pony Express used the technique of riders changing horses at stations approximately apart to maximize speed. Many of the towns along USÂ 50 originally served as stations along the Pony Express. The original numbered designation of this route, which appeared on Nevada Highway maps as far back as 1919, was State RouteÂ 2. RouteÂ 2 had an alternate branch, RouteÂ 2A, corresponding to a split in the Lincoln Highway near Fallon. The main and alternate branches of RouteÂ 2 are reversed from the modern routings of USÂ 50. Mainline RouteÂ 2, the Donner Branch, terminated at Fernley along modern USÂ 50 Alternate. State RouteÂ 2A, the Pioneer Branch, followed mainline USÂ 50, terminating at Carson City. State RouteÂ 2, and the Lincoln Highway, used a different routing between Ely and Salt Lake City, Utah from the modern routes. The original routing used what is now US 93 from Ely to the ghost town of Schellbourne and then dirt roads towards Tooele, Utah.
