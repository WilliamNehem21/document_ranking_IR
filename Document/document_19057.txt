In 1989, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen began writing the script for a film eventually released as "Miller's Crossing". The many threads of the story became complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the process. Although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer's block, the Coen brothers rejected this description. "It's not really the case that we were suffering from writer's block," Joel said in a 1991 interview, "but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a certain distance from "Miller's Crossing"." They went from Los Angeles to New York and began work on a different project.
In three weeks, the Coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor John Turturro, with whom they'd been working on "Miller's Crossing". The new film, "Barton Fink", was set in a large, seemingly abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the "Hotel Earle", was a driving force behind the story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film "Blood Simple" in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: "We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world."
