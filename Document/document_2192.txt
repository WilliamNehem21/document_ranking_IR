They moved toward basic and relocatable themes, for example, sustenance and nourishment, as educators would in a pre-school setting, with straightforward songs that were simple for kids to sing and recollect. The gathering sang similar 60s-style fly as The Cockroaches, yet with various verses, despite the fact that they were not bound to melodies about adoration and could expound on whatever intrigued and energized youthful youngsters, which was boundless. The music they composed and perform was impacted by nursery rhymes, people music, and shake melodies of the 1960s. Page announced, "Above all else, we're performers". The Wiggles caught the enthusiasm of kids by first engaging them, and after that by giving them instructive messages.
