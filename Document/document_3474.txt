On 10 December 2014, regardless of having been named in England's 30-man temporary 2015 Cricket World Cup squad, Kieswetter uncovered that he was all the while enduring vision issues. He declared that he would not play in the 2015 season and would look for further treatment. The next June, he reported his retirement from expert cricket, saying that, in spite of the fact that he was as yet equipped for playing, he couldn't play to the standard he needed: "At last I just idea, there are an excessive number of fair players in province cricketÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and good karma to themÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ however I would prefer not to be another." He discovered batting in floodlit conditions especially troublesome, and depicted the vision in his correct eye as being "just at 80 or 85 percent". He completed his vocation with comparable insights in five star and one-day cricket; in both he arrived at the midpoint of just shy of 40 and had scored eleven centuries. In Twenty20 cricket, his most astounding score was 89 not out, and he found the middle value of a little more than 30. In a meeting with "ESPNcricinfo" soon after his retirement, Kieswetter said that he would be keen on working in the media, maybe as a component of a discourse group for Twenty20 matches.
