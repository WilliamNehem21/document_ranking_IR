In 1858, the Mint tried new plans for the penny. Somewhere in the range of 60 and 100 arrangements of twelve example coins were struck, comprising of the standard Flying Eagle front-side, a "lean hawk" design, and the Indian Head configuration, mated with four unique wreaths for the switch. Snowden would settle on his decision of what configuration would be struck in 1859 from these examples; the sets were likewise sold to gatherers. The Indian Head configuration was clearly arranged by April, as on the twelfth of that month, a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that "I have discovered that another example piece for the penny has been struck off at the Mint [with] a head looking like that of the five dollar piece and on the invert a shield at the highest point of the olive and oak wreath", and requesting to buy an example. Different numismatists likewise looked for pieces: R. Coulton Davis, a Philadelphia pharmacist with connections to the Mint, wrote to Snowden in June educating him of a great story in a Boston paper, and Augustus B. Sage kept in touch with the Mint Director that month, requesting an example for himself, and one for the recently established American Numismatic Society.
