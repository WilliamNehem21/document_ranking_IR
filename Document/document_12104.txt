Deposits of paint have been found on numerous models and on different pieces of the ship. The whole ornamentation was once painted in clear hues. The sides of the beakhead (the jutting structure underneath the bowsprit), the defenses (the defensive railing around the climate deck), the tops of the quarter displays, and the foundation of the transom (the level surface at the stern of the ship) were altogether painted red, while the figures were designed in brilliant hues, and the stunning impact of these was in certain spots accentuated with gold leaf. Beforehand, it was trusted that the foundation shading had been blue and that the sum total of what models had been on the whole overlaid, and this is reflected in numerous depictions of "Vasa" from the 1970s to the mid 1990s, for example, the energetic and emotional illustrations of BjÃÂ¶rn LandstrÃÂ¶m or the canvas by Francis Smitheman. In the late 1990s, this view was updated and the hues are legitimately reflected in later generations of the ship's improvement by oceanic painter Tim Thompson and the 1:10 scale display in the gallery. "Vasa" is a model less of the intensely plated figures of early Baroque workmanship but instead 'the last pants of the medieval figure convention' with its affection for vainglorious hues, in a style that today would be viewed as indulgent or even foul.
