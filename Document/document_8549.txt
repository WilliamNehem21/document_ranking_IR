ÃÂthelwulf's will has not endure, yet Alfred's has and it gives some data about his dad's aims. The kingdom was to be partitioned between the two most seasoned enduring children, with ÃÂthelbald getting Wessex and ÃÂthelberht getting Kent and the south-east. The overcomer of ÃÂthelbald, ÃÂthelred and Alfred was to acquire their dad's booklandÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ his own property instead of the imperial terrains which ran with the kingshipÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and Abels and Yorke contend this most likely implies that the survivor was to acquire the position of authority of Wessex also. Different students of history oppose this idea. Nelson expresses that the arrangement in regards to the individual property had nothing to do with the authority, and Kirby remarks: "Such a course of action would have prompted fratricidal conflict. With three more seasoned siblings, Alfred's odds of achieving adulthood would, one feels, have been insignificant." ÃÂthelwulf's moveable riches, for example, gold and silver, was to be partitioned between "kids, nobles and the necessities of the ruler's spirit". For the last mentioned, he left one tenth of his inherited land to be put aside to nourish poor people, and he requested that three hundred mancuses be sent to Rome every year, one hundred to be spent on lighting the lights in St Peter's at Easter, one hundred for the lights of St Paul's, and one hundred for the pope.
