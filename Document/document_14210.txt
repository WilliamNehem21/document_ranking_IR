Amid the evening of 27/28 March, watches of the 47th Battalion had watched German troops on the AlbertÃ¢ÂÂ Dernancourt street, on the open pads right over the railroad line, yet the night go without clear indications of assault. Promptly toward the beginning of the day, the German big guns fell intensely on the help lines and back region, yet at first was light along the railroad line. In the thick fog of early day break, the leader of a little post of the 47th Battalion, positioned behind the dike quickly north of the dimension crossing, heard the sound of pike sheaths fluttering on the thighs of walking troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his friends and they rushed to alarm close-by components of the legion. McDougall, running along the highest point of the dike, saw German troops of II Battalion, 229 RIR (II/229 RIR) progressing along the entire front through the fog. Coming back with a bunch of men, he intended to convey them behind the unmanned bank toward the south. At this point, Germans were tossing hand explosives over the bank, and one detonated almost a Lewis assault rifle group before McDougall, seriously injuring the two-man team. McDougall, who had recently been a Lewis heavy armament specialist, got the firearm and started to flame it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light automatic rifle groups as they endeavored to cross the rails, at that point, running along the foe edge of the bank, saw around 20 Germans trusting that the flag will attack. He turned the weapon on them, and as they ran, tailed them with its shoot. At this point, a few of his companions had been murdered or injured.
