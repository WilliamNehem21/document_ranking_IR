Elements of the Austro-Hungarian fleet mutinied in Cattaro in February 1918, and in May, a plot was discovered to take over "80Â T" at Pola. The motive appeared to be nationalism. Two of the ringleaders, a Czech and a Dalmatian Croat, were tried, convicted and executed by firing squad. On 13 May, the destroyer , "84Â F" and "98Â M" were at Durazzo when two Italian MAS boats forced the harbour, sinking one Austro-Hungarian freighter. On 10 June, "76Â T""79Â T", "81Â T" and "87Â F" were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought from the Italian MAS boats that sank her. During that action, "76Â T" fired at the Italian boats, but did not score a hit. On 1 July, the destroyers "Balaton" and "CsikÃ³s", along with "83Â F" and "88Â F", were chased offshore from Caorle by seven Italian destroyers. All four Austro-Hungarian ships were hit, with "83Â F" hit three times, and "88Â F" struck once. One of the Italian destroyers was hit three times, and another was slightly damaged by splinters. On 6 September, "86Â F" and two other torpedo boats were engaged by three Italian destroyers in the Gulf of Drin. "86Â F" was hit, and the Austro-Hungarian force withdrew. On 2 October, "87Â F" was at Durazzo when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.
