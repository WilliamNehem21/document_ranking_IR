The Cloverleaf Trail and the Heenan Highway were assumed by the DHO shortly after its merger with the Department of Northern Development. Following the merger, the DHO began assigning trunk roads throughout northern Ontario as part of the provincial highway network. HighwayÂ 71 was assigned on SeptemberÂ 1, 1937, along the Cloverleaf Trail. The portion of the Heenan Highway lying within Kenora District was designated as HighwayÂ 70 on the same day. The portion within Rainy River District was designated as HighwayÂ 70 on SeptemberÂ 29.
The original route of HighwayÂ 70 split in two south of Finland; HighwayÂ 70 turned east to Off Lake Corner, then south to Emo, while HighwayÂ 70A turned west to Black Hawk then south to Barwick. The northern end of the highway was also concurrent with HighwayÂ 17 for into Kenora, and the southern end concurrent with HighwayÂ 71 for between Emo and Fort Frances. During 1952, the highway was extended south from its split to HighwayÂ 71, midway between Barwick and Emo. By 1953, the new road was opened and informally designated as the new route of HighwayÂ 70. The old routes were decommissioned on FebruaryÂ 8, and the new route designated several weeks later on MarchÂ 10, 1954. Both forks were later redesignated as HighwayÂ 600 and HighwayÂ 615.
