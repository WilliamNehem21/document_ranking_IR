In mid 1944, updates on the Philadelphia pilot plant achieved Robert Oppenheimer, the executive of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Oppenheimer wrote to Conant on 4 March 1944, and requested the reports on the fluid warm dispersion venture, which Conant sent. Like almost every other person, Oppenheimer had been considering uranium advancement as far as a procedure to create weapons grade uranium appropriate for use in a nuclear bomb, however at this point he thought about another choice. On the off chance that the sections at the Philadelphia plant were worked in parallel rather than in arrangement, at that point it may deliver 12ÃÂ kg every day of uranium improved to 1 percent. This could be significant in light of the fact that an electromagnetic enhancement process that could create one gram of uranium improved to 40 percent uranium-235 from regular uranium, could deliver two grams for each day of uranium advanced to 80 percent uranium-235 if the feed was advanced to 1.4 percent uranium-235, twofold the 0.7 percent of characteristic uranium. On 28 April, he kept in touch with Groves, bringing up that "the creation of the Y-12 plant could be expanded by about 30 or 40 percent, and its upgrade fairly improved, numerous months sooner than the booked date for K-25 generation."
