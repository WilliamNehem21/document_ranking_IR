The completion of SRÂ 520 spurred new development in Downtown Redmond and the Overlake area, contributing to major traffic congestion on the freeway. In 1994, the state government approved $81.1 million (equivalent to $Â million in dollars) in highway improvements for the SRÂ 520 corridor, including lane expansions and the addition of HOV lanes. The segment from West Lake Sammamish Parkway to SRÂ 202 was widened from two to four lanes in September 1995, and included the construction of a new bridge across the Sammamish River. In late 1996, the highway's terminus at SRÂ 202 was converted from a signalized intersection to an interchange, including an overpass connecting to Avondale Road. SRÂ 520's HOV lanes between I-405 and West Lake Sammamish Parkway were opened in 1999 after a $40 million (equivalent to $Â million in dollars) expansion project. The new lanes were restricted to two persons per vehicle, while the older HOV lanes between I-405 and the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge had a three-person requirement. A new interchange was built at Northeast 40th Street in 2000 to serve the Microsoft Redmond Campus and other nearby employers, along with a set of collectorâdistributor lanes through the area, and ramp meters to manage traffic flow. Between 1994 and 2002, portions of a multi-use pedestrian and bicycle path on the north side of the freeway were completed and opened, forming a trail from northern Bellevue to Marymoor Park in Redmond.
