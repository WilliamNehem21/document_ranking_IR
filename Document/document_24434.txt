"Wittelsbach" took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9â19 January and 27 FebruaryÂ â 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, SwinemÃ¼nde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Wittelsbach" and the main German fleet was anchored at SwinemÃ¼nde for the occasion. Politically, the visit was strained by the developing Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In September, "KapitÃ¤n zur See" Maximilian von Spee, who would go on to command the East Asia Squadron at the outbreak of World War I, took command of the ship.
