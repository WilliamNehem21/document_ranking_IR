"Dakotan" departed Saint-Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates "El Occidente", "Montanan", and "Edward Luckenbach". Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed collier , Navy oiler , and cruiser , the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the head of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force.
Sources do not reveal "Dakotan"s movements over the next months, but on 6 September 1917, the Naval Armed Guardsmen aboard "Dakotan" shelled a German submarine after its periscope had been sighted. On 29 January 1919, "Dakotan" was transferred to the Navy and commissioned the same day, with Lieutenant Commander J. Simmons, United States Naval Reserve Forces (USNRF), in command. Outfitted for service as a troop transport to return American servicemen from Europe, "Dakotan" made five transatlantic roundtrips to France as part of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force between 15 February and 20 July. Eastbound journeys delivered cargo to Saint-Nazaire and Bordeaux for the Army of Occupation; westbound trips returned soldiers to the United States. "Dakotan" carried a total of 8,812 troops on her five westbound voyages. "Dakotan" returned from her final voyage on 20 July, was decommissioned at New York on 31 July, and returned to American-Hawaiian the same day.
