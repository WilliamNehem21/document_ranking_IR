In the team's original plan, "Terra Nova" consisted of missions that were bookended by simplistic cutscenes, akin to those of the 1990 Origin Systems video game "Wing Commander". However, in 1994, Origin released "", which features live-action full-motion video (FMV) cutscenes. This pressured Looking Glass into incorporating FMV into "Terra Nova". Schmidt later said, "Lots of A-list games were including more and more FMV, and it was felt by management that if "Terra Nova" didn't have any, it would look second-rate." The decision to include it came when the game was already overdue, and a large portion of the game's funding was redirected toward cutscene production. A scriptwriter from outside the company was hired to write the cutscenes; because of the interplay between the cutscenes and missions, the script underwent numerous rewrites. The game's delays and large budget resulted in the removal of a planned online multiplayer component, and the FMV cutscenes, which were expensive to produce, increased the number of sales needed to recoup development costs. A patch was planned to release post-launch in September 1996 and add the online multiplayer functionality, but it did not materialize. Schmidt called the cutscenes a "giant distraction" for the team and himself as project leader: he later described them as "cheesier than most" of those from the period and noted that "I wince a lot looking back on [them]". Schmidt believed that they were likely an error from a business standpoint, as they further increased the game's budget and production length, but ultimately did not increase sales.
