In the second practice session, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 35.078 seconds. Rosberg was second with Bottas third, followed by Button, Vettel and RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen. The top ten was completed by Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the barrier at turn 18. Kobayashi lost control of the rear of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, while Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban GutiÃ©rrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14; this resulted in a second red flag, which brought the session to an early end due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Felipe Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vergne, Kvyat and Button occupied positions four through ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car, while GutiÃ©rrez lost control of his car's rear at the exit of turn 15 but avoided crashing into the wall.
