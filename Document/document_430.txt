In the feeling of Robin Fedden, an ambassador, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and writer of the Trust's first manual for Chartwell, the house turned into "the most vital nation house in Europe". A surge of companions, associates, displeased government workers and concerned military officers went to the house to give data to help Churchill's battle against conciliation. At Chartwell, he created what Fedden calls, his own "little Foreign OfficeÃÂ ... the center point of obstruction". The Chartwell guests' book, carefully kept up from 1922, records around 780 house visitors, not every one of them companions, however all grist to Churchill's factory. A case of the last was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's visitor for supper in April 1936. Hankey along these lines stated, "I don't more often than not make a note of private discussions however a few emerged which gave a sign of the line which Mr Churchill is probably going to take in expected discussions (on weapons and supply) in Parliament". After seven days, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and certain of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to pass on their perspectives on the need to utilize the League of Nations to counter German animosity. Vansittart stated, "there is no opportunity to lose. There is without a doubt an extraordinary peril that we will be past the point of no return".
