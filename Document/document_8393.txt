In late 1871 occupants of Brill requested of the Duke to stretch out the course to Brill and open a traveler administration. The Duke concurred; it is likely he had officially arranged traveler administrations to Brill, as correspondence from mid 1871 notices traveler offices at "the Brill end". In January 1872 a planned traveler timetable was distributed and the line was named the "Wotton Tramway". (Albeit formally named the "Wotton Tramway", it was generally known as the "Brill Tramway" from the season of its transformation to traveler use.) The new end of Brill railroad station, at the foot of Brill Hill around north of the town, opened in March 1872. In spite of the fact that it was presently a traveler railroad, merchandise traffic kept on being the main role of the line. The line was intensely used to transport blocks from the brickworks around Brill, and dairy cattle and milk from homesteads on the Wotton domain. By 1875 the line was bearing of milk every year. The inbound conveyance of linseed cake to the dairy ranches and of coal to the region's structures were likewise vital. The line started to convey compost from London to the zone's ranches, conveying in 1872. The tramway likewise opened a cartage business to deal with the ahead shipment of merchandise and bundles emptied at Brill and Wotton stations.
