Following the end of the 1891 County Championship, Hewett was a piece of Lord Hawke's gathering which visited North America, playing six matches in the United States of America and two in Canada. Sammy Woods composed that Hewett, alongside Charles Wreford-Brown and George Ricketts, turned out to be exceptionally nauseous on the adventure there. The initial two matches were top of the line apparatuses against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Hewett scored 30 and 49 in the initial, an eight wicket misfortune which Woods accused on occurring too early after their entry, asserting the group "had scarcely discovered our property legs." The main match had yielded a total of 861 runs, the second contained just 352, of which Hewett scored 10 and 29. His chief, Lord Hawke, was the main other batsman to achieve twofold figures in the two innings as the visiting side won by four wickets. None of the rest of the apparatuses on the visit had five star status, and not all were eleven-a-side challenges. Hewett scored 113 against the sixteen man All New York on Staten Island, a match in which he was remaining in as commander because of Lord Hawke being sick. Woods evaluated Hewett, alongside Lord Hawke and Brown, as the best batsmen on the visit.
