In mid 1148, Foliot went with Theobald of Bec to the Council of Reims, despite the fact that the diocese supervisor had been taboo to go to by King Stephen; Foliot was apparently with Theobald when the ecclesiastical overseer utilized a little angling watercraft in his getaway from England to the mainland. Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, passed on at the Council of Reims, and Foliot was assigned by Pope Eugene III to fill the Diocese of Hereford, which was held by the Angevin cause. Theobald was behind the arrangement, having encouraged it on the pope. It seems likely that before his sanctification Foliot gave affirmations that he would not swear fealty to Stephen. He was blessed Bishop of Hereford on 5ÃÂ September 1148 at Saint-Omer by Archbishop Theobald. The other English ministers present at ReimsÃ¢ÂÂHilary of Chichester and Josceline de BohonÃ¢ÂÂwould not help with the sanctification, asserting it was in opposition to custom for an English cleric to be blessed outside England. One more of the ministers' worries was that the pope had encroached Stephen's entitlement to a say in the decision. After his sanctification Foliot swore fealty to Henry of Anjou, the child of the Empress and the new leader of the Angevin party.
