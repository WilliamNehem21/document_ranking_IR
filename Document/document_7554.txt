The flare-up of war in September 1939 separated the Mitford family. Nancy and Rodd upheld the war; the Romillys had at this point left for America, while the others either sought after an Anglo-German dÃÂ©tente or, likewise with Unity, were transparently ace Nazi. Solidarity was in Munich when war was proclaimed; in despondency she endeavored suicide by shooting herself in the head. She endure, and was sent home through nonpartisan Switzerland. Mosley and Diana, who had hitched furtively in 1936, were kept under Defense Regulation 18B. Nancy, in full enemy of fundamentalist mode, had depicted her sister to the British Intelligence organization MI5 as "a merciless and smart narcissist, a dedicated extremist and admirer of Hitler [who] earnestly wants the defeat of England and vote based system when all is said in done." During the "fake war" of 1939Ã¢ÂÂ 40, Nancy was quickly an Air Raid Precautions (ARP) driver, and later worked movements at an emergency treatment post in Paddington. She drew on these encounters in her fourth novel, "Pigeon Pie", a satire about spying. It was distributed by Hamish Hamilton in May 1940, when there was minimal open craving for cheerful war parody, and the book was a business disappointment.
