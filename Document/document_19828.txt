"Orizaba"ânamed after the town of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexicoâwas laid down for the Ward Line by William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia and launched in February 1917. In mid-1917 the United States Shipping Board (USSB) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, including the still-incomplete "Orizaba" and her sister ship "Siboney". Plans for both ships were modified for troop-carrying duties. Upon "Orizaba"âs completion, the USSB delivered her to the US Navy for transport duty on 11 April 1918, and she was commissioned as USS "Orizaba" (ID-1536) on 27 May.
Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, "Orizaba" carried over 15,000Â troops in six convoy trips to France before the end of World War I. In one such voyage, "Orizaba"âs executive officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace Whiteâ"Orizaba"âs commanding officer, himself an ordnance expertâto develop a workable depth charge launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.
