Amid 1957 Gielgud coordinated Berlioz's "The Trojans" at Covent Garden and played Prospero at Drury Lane, however the creation vital to his vocation over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his exclusive show "The Ages of Man". He originally showed up in this in 1956 and restored it consistently until 1967. It was a treasury of Shakespearean discourses and poems, assembled by George Rylands, in which, wearing present day evening garments on a plain stage, Gielgud recounted the stanzas, with his very own connecting analysis. He performed it all over Britain, terrain Europe, Australasia and the US, including an execution at the White House in 1965. He found there were points of interest to performing solo: "You've no thought how much simpler it is without a Juliet. At the point when there's a lovely young lady above you on a gallery, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, normally the crowd take a gander at her the entire time, and Romeo needs to destroy out every one of the stops to stand out enough to be noticed." His execution on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and a sound chronicle in 1979 got a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made numerous different chronicles, both when this, including ten Shakespeare plays.
