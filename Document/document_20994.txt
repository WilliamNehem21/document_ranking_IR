Early versions featured simplified graphics, and the different ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of Gamasutra thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection. He listed the Amiga, Game Boy, and Sega Mega Drive ports as the better conversions, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, PC, and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst. "Compute!" writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay "arcade-quality". "Computer Gaming World" stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. Bruce Webster of "BYTE" wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of "Marble Madness" in December 1986 "are really amazing". While criticizing the lack of a pause function or a top scores list, he stated that it "is definitely worth having if you own an Amiga". Bil Herd recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at Commodore International that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues' computers to run the game. He wrote "Not an Amiga" on his Commodore 128D so others would not open it looking for Amiga memory. "Info" gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as "a totally faithful adaptation". It gave the Commodore 64 version three-plus stars out of five, describing it as "just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version" and inferior to "Spindizzy". The magazine liked the graphics but criticized "marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles". "Dragon"s three reviewersâHartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesserâpraised the Apple II port, calling it a "must have" title for arcade fans.
