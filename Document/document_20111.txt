The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250Â BC by the Greek mathematician Archimedes. This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1,000 years, and as a result is sometimes referred to as "Archimedes' constant". Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that (that is ). Archimedes' upper bound of may have led to a widespread popular belief that is equal to . Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy, in his "Almagest", gave a value for of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga. Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits.
In ancient China, values for included 3.1547 (around 1 AD), (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and (3rd century, approximately 3.1556). Around 265 AD, the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon-based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of ofÂ 3.1416. Liu later invented a faster method of calculating and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor ofÂ 4. The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, around 480 AD, calculated that (a fraction that goes by the name "MilÃ¼" in Chinese), using Liu Hui's algorithm applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value of 3.141592920 remained the most accurate approximation of available for the next 800 years.
