Since gold did not circle in the United States (aside from on the West Coast) in the after war time frame, a significant part of the creation of coins of that metal in the United States was twofold birds for fare. As needs be, albeit 1,361,355 gold dollars were struck in 1862Ã¢ÂÂthe last time generation would surpass a millionÃ¢ÂÂthe mintage tumbled to 6,200 of every 1863 and stayed low for the remainder of the coin's presence, with the exception of 1873 and 1874. The Mint felt it ill-advised to suspend coinage of a coin approved by Congress, and issued verification coins (for the most part a couple of dozen to the minor numismatic network) from uniquely cleaned bites the dust, likewise delivering enough dissemination strikes with the goal that the confirmation coins would not be unduly uncommon. In 1873 and 1874, old and worn gold dollars held by the administration were liquefied and recoined, creating substantial mintages of that group. This was done fully expecting the resumption of specie installments, which did not happen until the finish of 1878. When specie again coursed without needing any proof, the gold dollar found no spot in business in the midst of extensive amounts of silver coinage, either discharged from accumulating or recently struck by the Mint. The administration expected that the resumption of specie installments would cause the dollar and other little gold coins to flow once more, however the general population, permitted to reclaim paper cash, kept on utilizing it as more helpful than coins.
