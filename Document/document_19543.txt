"Aaliyah" was met with highly positive reviews from most critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76, based on 14 reviews. Michael Odell of "The Guardian" called it a flawless blend of pop and R&B that was "as much a brochure for the current state of R&B production facilities" as it was a showcase for Aaliyah's singing. He found the music's textures "scintillating" and believed its distinguishing characteristic to be "a playful and confident reworking of the [R&B] canon". In the "Chicago Tribune", Brad Cawn wrote that Aaliyah demonstrated Sade's grace and Missy Elliott's daring with fashionable neo soul that was "equal parts attitude and harmony, and all urban music perfection", while Russell Baillie from "The New Zealand Herald" deemed the music innovative dance-pop on what he called "a cohesive, detailed and disarmingly enticing album". Simon Price, writing for "The Independent", cited the record as "further evidence that black pop is the avant garde". In a review for "The A.V. Club", Nathan Rabin argued that the album established Aaliyah as a significant artist unobscured by her collaborators, while Hardy from "Rolling Stone" called it "a near-flawless declaration of strength and independence" in which Aaliyah explored her "fantasies and strengths". Writing for "Spin", Clover viewed the record as her most profound work and said she had made "art" out of Timbaland and Static's "formal finesse" by "investing sound schemes with urgency and emotional intricacy".
