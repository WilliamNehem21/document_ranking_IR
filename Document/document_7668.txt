The rest of Teach's team and previous partners were found by Brand, in Bath, and were transported to Williamsburg, Virginia, where they were imprisoned on charges of robbery. A few were dark, inciting Spotswood to ask his chamber what should be possible about "the Circumstances of these Negroes to absolved them from experiencing the equivalent Tryal as different privateers." Regardless, the men were attempted with their companions in Williamsburg's Capitol working, under office of the chief naval officer law, on 12ÃÂ March 1719. No records of the day's procedures remain, yet 14ÃÂ of the 16ÃÂ accused were discovered blameworthy. Of the staying two, one demonstrated that he had shared of the battle out of need, having been on Teach's ship just as a visitor at a drinking party the prior night, and not as a privateer. The other, Israel Hands, was absent at the battle. He asserted that amid a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was as yet secured by the illustrious exoneration. The rest of the privateers were hanged, at that point left to decay in gibbets along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (referred to for quite a while after as "Scaffold Road").
