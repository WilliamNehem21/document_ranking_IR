On February 3, 2005, Bethesda went into a concurrence with Take-Two Interactive in regards to the distribution and arrival of "Obscurity". Under the understanding, Bethesda would hold full authority over "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s improvement and the rights to any conceivable continuations, and Take-Two would consent to distribute the amusement under its as of late framed 2K Games sub brand. As per Producer Gavin Carter, the group's experience was an irregularity in the business; couple of free engineer distributer connections still exist, and it was an unexpected that Bethesda's experience worked out just as it did. Carter depicted Take-Two's job as one of negligible impedance, and the organization for the most part disregarded Bethesda's improvement groups, confiding in them to deliver an "incredible item" with insignificant obstruction or "formality". The relationship was an irregularity in the business, as indicated by Carter, where most designers are under obligation to their distributers. Ashley Cheng, "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s senior maker, agreed. There was "finished opportunity" at Bethesda to choose their own way, whatever advertise patterns may state. Of the lawful procedures influencing Bethesda's parent organization ZeniMax amid the underlying phases of amusement advancement, when Bethesda organizer Christopher Weaver sued the organization for severance pay, Todd Howard said that he, as a maker, wasn't required with corporate issues. "I simply center around the amusements."
