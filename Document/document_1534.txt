It was not until 1922 that Dunne, driven by monetary need, started to chip away at Dooley once more, first by shortening old sections for re-syndication, and after that, amid the 1924 presidential crusade, composing new ones for the papers, with Mr. Dooley's bar changed by Prohibition into a speakeasy. Starting right off the bat in the year, these showed up on a week by week premise yet finished in the last days of the battle, and strife with the syndicator when Dunne was unfit to deliver expected sections put a conclusion to unique Mr. Dooley in papers. Albeit unmistakably highlighted, these new segments did not create a lot of intrigue. In any case, Dunne was urged enough to concur, in 1926, to complete an ordinary Dooley piece for the week by week "Freedom" magazine. These showed up routinely for a half year, and after that Dunne finished the game plan. Ellis hypothesized that Dunne may never again have been in money related need, or realized that the pieces were not up to the gauges he had before set. Dunne's kinship with a portion of the figures related with the embarrassments of the Harding organization, for example, Harry Daugherty and Edward Doheny, made it troublesome for Mr. Dooley to keep up his posture of unengaged outcast, and Dunne in a roundabout way protected Daugherty in one piece. Dunne's last Mr. Dooley section was "On the Farmer's Woes", showing up in the July 3, 1926 issue.
