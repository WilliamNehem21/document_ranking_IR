He is dependably there, he knows everything. He is dependable however continually coming up short. At the point when the young men salvage him, he is ordinarily gaunt, got dried out, semi-cognizant, woozy; they should help him with pieces of candy and water. He can take on any shape, yet uncovers his personality inside snapshots of doing as such. He never examines a case with the exception of the one he's taking a shot at in a given novel, so his incredible close-mouthedness swings to loquaciousness when a "Strong Boys" novel starts, which is obviously the main time we get the opportunity to see him. All the equivalent, he just examines the case in enough detail to deceive his children and place them in mortal peril. He has frameworks of data and information assembling that put the FBI to disgrace, yet he is continually losing his case noticed, his figures, his microfilm, or some other significant hint, more often than not by abandoning it in his some jeans, implying that the Boys need to drive to Canada or Florida or some place to recover it. I guess he isn't secretive in any way; he basically encapsulates what many think about their own dads: absolutely ground-breaking, wretchedly maladroit.
