In 2008, he appeared in the independent crime drama "Winged Creatures" (released as "Fragments" on DVD) alongside Dakota Fanning as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre, and in "Journey to the Center of the Earth", a 3D film adaptation of the novel of the same name where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle he hardly knows, played by Brendan Fraser. Over the next two years, he appeared as a boy named Steve "Leopard" Leonard who visits a freak show with his friends in the vampire fiction of the book "Cirque du Freak" and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed "The Kids Are All Right", portraying the son of a lesbian couple, played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore. According to Kaleem Aftab of "The Independent", his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood. Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film, displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion PictureÂ â Musical or Comedy in 2010, and was a nominee for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards. Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site HitFix stated: "Hutcherson's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it's arguably the first film where he proves he's more than just another sharp-looking teen actor."
