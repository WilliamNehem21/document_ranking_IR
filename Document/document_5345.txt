Defers prompted a skipped month, with the December 1967 and January 1968 issues being joined into one, yet a month to month plan returned from that point. The March 1968 issue contained the third portion of Norman Spinrad's tale "Bug Jack Barron", which incorporated some genuinely unequivocal sexual moments. An individual from parliament grumbled in the House of Commons that the Arts Council was "supporting foulness"; and soon W.H. Smith and John Menzies, the two fundamental retail outlets for magazines in the UK, pulled back the magazine from deal. The objections came when the Arts Council was thinking about restoring the allow for one more year, and it showed up for some time that "New Worlds" would need to stop production, however in the long run the concede was recharged. With cash from promoting, and a significant commitment from Moorcock himself, the magazine had the capacity to endure. The loss of income brought about by the withdrawal from clearance of the March 1968 issue was exacerbated by a brief prohibition on the magazine in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and by John Menzies' consequent choice not to stock "New Worlds". W.H. Smith left it to their individual branch supervisors to choose whether or not to convey the magazine. Stonehart were discontent with advancements and wouldn't pay the printers, who thus retained the printed duplicates. The Arts Council cash had been planned for the benefactors, however a contradiction over the concede prompted Stonehart<nowiki>'s refusal to pay them also. Some negative inclusion showed up in the press as an outcome of the appropriation boycott. The allow was in the end restored, however by late that year Stein had enough. Stonehart stopped their inclusion with "New Worlds"</nowiki> after the July 1968 issue.
