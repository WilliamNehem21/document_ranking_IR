In early drafts of the melodic, Hammerstein gave huge parts to two characters who in the end came to have just minor jobs, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert. Harbison is one of the significant characters in "Stories of the South Pacific"; a model officer toward the begin, he bit by bit ruffians to the point where, with fight unavoidable, he demands his compelling dad in-law to secure for him an exchange to a post in the United States. Hammerstein considered him as an opponent to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a tune, "The Bright Young Executive of Today". As redrafts concentrated the play on the two couples, Harbison turned out to be less fundamental, and he was consigned to a little job as the official officer to the administrator of the island, Captain Brackett. Dinah, a medical attendant and companion of Nellie, is additionally a noteworthy character in Michener's work, and was viewed as a conceivable love enthusiasm for Billis, however any genuine sentiment was constrained by Navy guidelines prohibiting fraternization between officers (every single American medical caretaker in World War II were authorized officers) and enrolled men. "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" began as a two part harmony for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah starting the tune and building up its subject. As indicated by Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's "fellowship turned out to be progressively coincidental to the plot as the composition proceeded. Hammerstein in the end understood that the choice to wash Emile out of her hair must be Nellie's. At exactly that point did the scene have the sensational potential for Nellie's passionate progress" as she understands her adoration for Emile. In the last form, Dinah holds one solo line in the melody.
