After an uneventful period, Butuga II rose the royal position in 938 with the assistance of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha III (whose little girl he wedded). He helped the Rashtrakutas win definitive triumphs in Tamilakam in the clash of Takkolam against the Chola Dynasty. With this triumph, the Rashtrakutas assumed responsibility for current northern Tamil Nadu. As an end-result of their valor, the Gangas were granted broad regions in the Tungabhadra waterway valley. Ruler Marasimha II who came to control in 963 supported the Rashtrakutas in triumphs against the Gurjara Pratihara King Lalla and the Paramara lords of Malwa in Central India. Chavundaraya, a priest in the Western Ganga court was a valiant authority, capable director and a practiced artist in Kannada and Sanskrit. He served King Marasimha II and his successors capably and helped King Rachamalla IV smother a common war in 975. Towards the finish of the tenth century, the Rashtrakutas had been displaced by the Western Chalukya Empire in Manyakheta. In the south, the Chola Dynasty who were seeing a resurgence of intensity under Rajaraja Chola I vanquished Gangavadi around the year 1000, finishing the Western Ganga tradition. From that point, huge zones of south Karnataka locale went under Chola control for about a century.
