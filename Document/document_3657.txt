Murphy featured as Patrick/"Little cat" Braden, a transgender Irish lady looking for her mom, in Neil Jordan's satire dramatization "Breakfast on Pluto" (2005), in light of the novel of a similar title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film's colorful background of 1970s sparkle shake style, enchantment appears, shady areas of town and IRA viciousness, Murphy changes from gender ambiguous youngster to high drag fair sensation. He had tried out for the job in 2001, and however Jordan loved him for the part, the chief of "The Crying Game" was reluctant to return to transgender and IRA issues. The performer campaigned Jordan for quite a while in an offer to get the film made before Murphy turned out to be too old to even think about playing the part; in 2004, he arranged for the job by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with different transvestites. The job required "genuine preparing" with eyebrow culling and chest and leg hair expulsion, and Roger Ebert noticed the manner in which that Murphy played the character with a "bewildered and confident voice". While even tepid audits of "Breakfast on Pluto" still would in general applause Murphy's execution profoundly, a couple of faultfinders disagreed: "The Village Voice", which panned the film, discovered him "unconvincing" and excessively adorable.
