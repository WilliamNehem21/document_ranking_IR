In May 2002, the club was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor's plan to market it in the United States. Persimmon, which had bought 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent, and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor. The club entered a creditors' voluntary agreement in November 2002, and the "York Evening Press" said York had been "plunged into the darkest, coldest days of its history". The club went into administration in December 2002, and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face bankruptcy. The ST donated Â£92,000 to give the club a temporary reprieve. The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the Inland Revenue accepted an offer of Â£100,000 as payment for Â£160,000 owed in tax. Steve Beck became the new chairman. Batchelor had diverted almost all of the Â£400,000 Persimmon sponsorship money away from York to his racing team, and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised. He left the club with a profit of Â£120,000 and admitted to asset stripping during his time as owner. Despite the off-field problems, York pushed for promotion in 2002â03 and were in an automatic promotion place by late March 2003. They won none of their last six matches and finished the season in 10th place.
