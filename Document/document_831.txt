None of Cooper's movies discharged in 2015Ã¢ÂÂ"Salud", "Copied", or "Euphoria"Ã¢ÂÂ performed especially well in the cinema world. He featured in Cameron Crowe's "Salaam" with Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. The venture ended up dubious after the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans blamed the producers for whitewashing the cast. Notwithstanding the analysis, he was designated for Choice Movie Actor Ã¢ÂÂ Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. In John Wells' dramatization "Consumed", Cooper played a gourmet specialist who chooses to recapture his previous greatness after medication misuse negatively affects his profession. While the film was scrutinized for its "exaggerated banalities", Jon Frosch of "The Hollywood Reporter" composed of Cooper's execution, "the on-screen character gives a completely drawn in execution that nearly makes us need to excuse the motion picture's sluggishness. Nearly." His supporting job in the biopic "Euphoria" rejoined him with David O. Russell and Lawrence. In 2016, he had a voice appearance in the spine chiller "10 Cloverfield Lane", and had a supporting impact in "War Dogs", co-created under his and Todd Phillips' generation organization Joint Effort. In 2017, Cooper again voiced Rocket Raccoon, in "Watchmen of the Galaxy Vol. 2". Cooper's movies have earned an aggregate of $7.8 billion around the world.
