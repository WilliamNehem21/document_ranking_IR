Universal District/Chinatown station, the southernmost passage station, is somewhat outside and found promptly beneath an open court at Union Station. The station has associations with Amtrak and Sounder suburbanite rail at King Street Station a square toward the west, available through the Weller Street Bridge, just as the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, ceasing east of fifth Avenue South. Different attractions close to the station incorporate CenturyLink Field toward the west and Uwajimaya a square toward the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks, and transport paths are isolated by railroad signals at an underground transport delay and organizing region alongside the passage comfort space for transport drivers. The southern entry of the passage is situated under the crossing point of Airport Way and fifth Avenue South at the western end of the previous Interstate 90 express paths for high-inhabitance vehicles. Light rail trains and southbound transports proceed from the passage in isolated paths on the SODO Busway, while eastward transports utilize a lot of inclines that movement onto Interstate 90. Eastward transports some time ago utilized a slope that converges with the Interstate 90 express paths that shut in September 2018 and will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail administration that starts in 2023.
