Harm totaled over $200ÃÂ million (1991ÃÂ USD) and the loss of life was thirteen. The greater part of the harm happened while the tempest was extratropical, after waves up to struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where harm was heaviest, over 100ÃÂ homes were annihilated or seriously harmed. Toward the north, more than 100ÃÂ homes were influenced in Maine, including the country estate of George H.W. Shrubbery, the president at the time. More than 38,000ÃÂ people were left without power, and along the coast high waves immersed streets and structures. In segments of New England, harm was more regrettable than had happened from Hurricane Bob two months earlier. In any case, beside tidal flooding along streams, the tempest's belongings were fundamentally along the coastline. A float off the bank of Nova Scotia announced a wave tallness of 100.7ÃÂ ft (30.7ÃÂ m), the most astounding at any point recorded in the area's seaward waters. Amidst the tempest, the "Andrea Gail" sunk, killing its group of six, which later propelled the book just as the motion picture "The Perfect Storm". Off the shore of New York, a Coast Guard helicopter came up short on fuel and slammed, and albeit four individuals from its team were protected, one was executed. Two individuals kicked the bucket after their watercraft sank off Staten Island. High waves cleared an individual to their demise in both Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, and someone else was brushed off an extension in New York. The tropical violent wind that shaped late in the tempest's length caused little effect, restricted to control blackouts and smooth streets; one individual was slaughtered in Newfoundland from a car crash identified with the tempest.
