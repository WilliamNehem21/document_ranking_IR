"Voalavo" is part of the subfamily Nesomyinae, which includes nine genera that are all restricted to Madagascar. Before the discoveries of "Monticolomys" (published in 1996) and "Voalavo" (1998), all of the known genera within Nesomyinae were quite distinct from each other, so much so that phylogenetic relationships among them long remained obscure. Like "Monticolomys" (closely related to "Macrotarsomys"), however, "Voalavo" shows clear similarities to another nesomyine genus, "Eliurus". In their description of "Voalavo", Carleton and Goodman argued that, although closely related, "Eliurus" and "Voalavo" form separate monophyletic groups; but a 1999 molecular phylogenetic study by Sharon Jansa and colleagues, who compared cytochrome "b" sequences among nesomyines and other rodents, found that northern voalavo was more closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat than to other species of "Eliurus". This finding called into question the separate generic status of "Voalavo". However, tissue samples of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a species that is thought to be closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, were not available, so this species could not be included in the study. Data from nuclear genes also supports the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.
