On 1 November 1900, "Kaiser Friedrich III" supplanted "Kaiser Wilhelm II" as the I Squadron leader; the last mentioned, as the armada lead, stayed alloted to the squadron for strategic purposes. From 4 to 15 December, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the I Squadron went on a winter preparing journey to Norway; the boats tied down at Larvik from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from Danzig to Kiel with "Kaiser Friedrich III" when the last struck a submerged impediment. The stun from the crash harmed the ship's boilers and began a flame in the coal dugouts. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" took her sister close behind, in spite of the fact that the motors on "Kaiser Friedrich III" were restarted en route. The boats in the long run came to Kiel, where impermanent fixes were led. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" went into drydock in January 1901 for redesign and some modernization work. This incorporated the reproduction of a bigger scaffold and the expulsion of a portion of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, "Chief of naval operations" Hans von Koester supplanted Hoffmann as the armada officer, a position he would hold until the finish of 1906.
