The three ladies plot their system ("Gaie Comari di Windsor"/"Happy spouses of Windsor, the time has come!"). They are in high spirits, yet Alice sees that Nannetta isn't. This is on the grounds that Ford intends to wed her to Dr Caius, a man mature enough to be her granddad; the ladies promise her that they will avert it. Escort Quickly reports Falstaff's entry, and Mistress Ford has a vast clothing bushel and a screen set in status. Falstaff's endeavors to lure Alice with stories of his past magnificence ("Quand'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk"/"When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slim") are stopped, as Mistress Quickly reports the approaching landing of Ford with an entourage of partners in crime to get his significant other's darling. Falstaff shrouds first behind the screen, and after that the ladies conceal him in the clothing bushel. Meanwhile Fenton and Nannetta hole up behind the screen. The men hear the sound of a kiss behind it. They expect it is Falstaff with Alice, however rather they locate the youthful sweethearts. Portage orders Fenton to leave. Inside the hamper Falstaff is practically choking. While the men continue the inquiry of the house Alice arranges her hirelings to toss the clothing bushel through the window into the River Thames, where Falstaff perseveres through the scoffs of the group.
