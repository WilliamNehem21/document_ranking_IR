After the Huáº¿ Pháº­t Äáº£n shootings on May 8, civil unrest broke out in South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Diá»m after defying a government ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diá»m for religious equality and compensation and justice for the families of the victims. With Diá»m remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk ThÃ­ch Quáº£ng Äá»©c at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diá»m regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Diá»m's policies. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diá»m's brother NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Nhu conducted the XÃ¡ Lá»£i Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumors of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.
