The beginning of the name Parrett is indistinct, however a few inferences from the Celtic dialects utilized in Wales have been proposed. Priestley-Evans recommends, "Parrett has been said to be a type of the Welsh "pared", a segment, and that it was the name which the Welsh individuals of Somerset and Devon provided for that waterway since it was at one time the separating line among themselves and the Saxons". Another spelling, "parwydydd", is additionally deciphered as parcel. Another clarification from Welsh, "Peraidd", signifying "the sweet or delectable stream", has additionally been recommended. An elective clarification, in light of Old English, is a deduction from "Pedair" or "Pedride" from "pedr", which means four and the Old Cornish "Rit" which means stream, which for this situation would identify with the four streams or streams: the Tone, Yeo, Isle and Parrett. This depends on the clarification given in Ekwall's 1928 book "English River Names". Whichever inference is right, the name Parrett and its spelling varieties have been being used since the Anglo-Saxon time, as confirm by the expansion of "- tun" onto waterway names as found in the neighborhood towns North Petherton and South Petherton. The spelling "Pedred" and "Pedrida" are additionally referenced regarding the Parrett. The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names states just that the name is a 'pre-English waterway name of cloud cause'.
