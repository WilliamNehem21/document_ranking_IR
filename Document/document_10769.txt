Toriyama gave him a harsh blueprint of the initial eight sections, which incorporated a few foundation scenes that should have been kept, similar to when party individuals were isolated or rejoined. He disclosed to Watanabe what he needed to express with the situation, and requested that he tissue out the story and to reinforce how the focuses in his blueprint associated. For instance, Toriyama's simple guidelines in the archive would state "Snow and Hope accommodate". Watanabe needed to choose about how the scenes with this compromise would play out, at that point compose the situation that way. To underline what the story attempted to express, Watanabe balanced the identities Toriyama had given to each character. For instance, he felt that the gathering ought not have a "solid and quiet pioneer type" toward the start of the story, so as to all the more precisely demonstrate the perplexity and unease after the heroes change into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the narrating difficulties was the give up all hope of the characters and the numerous focuses at which they are apparently cornered. He referenced the scene where Sazh endeavors to end it all as one such precedent: Although Toriyama felt it was "just about excessively dim", he needed to incorporate something like it in the amusement. Interestingly, he said that cheerful components, for example, Sazh's Chocobo chick kept up a decent parity.
