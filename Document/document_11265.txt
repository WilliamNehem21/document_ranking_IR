One of the letters was from Bannon, requesting proficient help with getting distributed. On writing to Meaker, she stated, "right up 'til the present time I have no clue why she reacted to me out of the a large number of letters she was getting around then. Express gratitude toward God she did. I was both excited and frightened." Bannon visited Meaker and was acquainted with Greenwich Village, which established a noteworthy connection on Bannon: she called it "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon joinedÃ¢ÂÂa spot where gay individuals could walk the warped avenues inseparably."

It was a tale about the ladies in her sorority whom she appreciated, with a subplot comprising of two sorority sisters who had begun to look all starry eyed at one another. Carroll advised her to take it back and center around the two characters who had an unsanctioned romance. Bannon claims she returned and recounted to their story, conveyed the draft to Carroll and saw it distributed without a solitary word changed. While bringing up two youthful kids, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and brought stumbles into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and remained with companions. She said of the ladies she found in Greenwich Village, "I needed to be one of them, to address other ladies, if just in print. Thus I made a startÃ¢ÂÂand that start was the story that progressed toward becoming "Odd Girl Out"."
