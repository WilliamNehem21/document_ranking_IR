In the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies have built up a substantial catalogue of FaurÃ©'s music, performed by French and non-French musicians. Several modern recordings of FaurÃ©'s music have come to public notice as prize-winners in annual awards organised by "Gramophone" and the BBC. Sets of his major orchestral works have been recorded under conductors including Michel Plasson (1981) and Yan Pascal Tortelier (1996). FaurÃ©'s main chamber works have all been recorded, with players including the YsaÃ¿e Quartet, Domus, Paul Tortelier, Arthur Grumiaux, and Joshua Bell. The complete piano works have been recorded by Kathryn Stott (1995), and Paul Crossley (1984â85), with substantial sets of the major piano works from Jean-Philippe Collard (1982â84), Pascal RogÃ© (1990), and Kun-Woo Paik (2002). FaurÃ©'s songs have all been recorded for CD, including a complete set (2005), anchored by the accompanist Graham Johnson, with soloists Jean-Paul FouchÃ©court, Felicity Lott, John Mark Ainsley and Jennifer Smith, among others. The Requiem and the shorter choral works are also well represented on disc. "PÃ©nÃ©lope" has been recorded twice, with casts headed by RÃ©gine Crespin in 1956, and Jessye Norman in 1981, conducted respectively by DÃ©sirÃ©-Ãmile Inghelbrecht and Charles Dutoit. "PromÃ©thÃ©e" has not been recorded in full, but extensive excerpts were recorded under Roger Norrington (1980).
