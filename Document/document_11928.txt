They attempted again on 16 August, this time with the gunboats and guarding the minesweepers. "Slava" overflowed her side compartments to give herself a 3ÃÂ° list which expanded her most extreme range to about . She didn't connect with the German ships, yet just terminated on the minesweepers and any German ships, for example, the protected cruiser when they moved toward the other Russian boats. At the point when the Germans restored the following day "Slava" was hit multiple times by shells one after another. The main hit entered her upper belt protective layer and detonated in a coal dugout; the second hit infiltrated her upper deck, hit the supporting container of the toward the back port side six-inch turret and began a flame in the ammo lift which made the magazine be overwhelmed. The third shell went through a couple of the ship's pontoons, yet detonated in the water off to the other side. These hits did not genuinely harm "Slava" and she stayed set up until requested to withdraw. The Germans entered the Gulf the following day, however they were compelled to pull back without further ado thereafter when the British submarine torpedoed the battlecruiser on 19 August and the Russian seaside cannons that still directed the Irbe Strait made it extremely unsafe to enter the Gulf of Riga.
