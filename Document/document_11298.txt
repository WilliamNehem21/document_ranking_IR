Agnew openly bolstered social liberties, yet despised the aggressor strategies utilized by some dark chiefs. Amid the 1966 race, his record had won him the underwriting of Roy Wilkins, pioneer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In mid-1967, racial strain was rising broadly, energized by dark discontent and an inexorably self-assured social liberties authority. A few urban areas detonated in viciousness, and there were revolts in Cambridge, Maryland, after an ignitable discourse there on July 24, 1967, by radical understudy pioneer H. Rap Brown. Agnew's vital concern was to keep up peace, and he impugned Brown as an expert fomenter, saying, "I trust they put him away and discard the key." When the Kerner Commission, designated by President Johnson to explore the reasons for the agitation, detailed that the foremost factor was institutional white bigotry, Agnew expelled these discoveries, accusing the "tolerant atmosphere and misinformed sympathy" and including: "It isn't the time of prejudice and hardship that have worked to an unstable crescendo, butÃÂ ... that lawbreaking has turned into a socially worthy and sometimes snappy type of contradiction". In March 1968, when looked with an understudy blacklist at Bowie State College, a truly dark establishment, Agnew again accused outside fomenters and wouldn't consult with the understudies. At the point when an understudy advisory group came to Annapolis and requested a gathering, Agnew shut the school and requested in excess of 200 captures.
