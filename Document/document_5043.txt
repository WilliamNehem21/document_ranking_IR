From before midnight on 27 March, the now worn out twelfth Brigade had been holding the railroad line among Albert and Dernancourt, having mitigated the ninth (Scottish) Division. The forward places of the striking held by the twelfth Brigade were along the railroad line, which kept running along a progression of banks and cuttings, up to however excluding a rail line connect quickly northwest of Dernancourt where the DernancourtÃ¢ÂÂ LaviÃÂ©ville street go under the railroad. Northwest of Dernancourt, a mushroom-formed component known as the LaviÃÂ©ville Heights disregarded the railroad line, which bended around its foot. This was troublesome ground to guard, especially where the railroad line bended and avoided the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as the edges of the town were extremely near the railroad line now, and gave great camouflage to moving toward adversary troops. In the event that the line there was invade, the foe would almost certainly fire into the back of the troops conveyed along the railroad in the two bearings. In spite of this, the Australian leaders thought of it as essential to hold the railroad line; in the event that it was not garrisoned, the adversary could collect in the dead ground behind the bank. A further trouble emerged from the way that if an assault happened amid light, it would be practically difficult to move troops down the presented slants to strengthen the railroad line without devastating misfortunes, and troops pulling back from the rail route line would be comparatively uncovered. To bear the cost of them some assurance along the railroad line, the forward posts delved small time specialties in the close side of the dike, however the main route for them to flame was to move up and lie over the bank, consequently presenting themselves to adversary fire.
