Notices expressed that "Cloud" was "Scotland's first S.F. magazine!!" Several British sci-fi fans helped Hamilton with the generation of the magazine, including Ken Slater, VinÃÂ¢ Clarke, and John Brunner. William F. Sanctuary was included as an article advisor and furthermore helped with altering the original copies. Hamilton gave all the financing, however he needed to trust that the cash will roll in from each issue before he could stand to create the following. What's more, Crownpoint just irregularly had enough extra ability to print "Cloud", so the initial couple of issues showed up on an inconsistent calendar. After twelve issues, the contentions prompted Hamilton moving "Cloud" to a printing firm situated in Dublin, and breaking the association with Crownpoint. He was then ready to distribute on a somewhat increasingly ordinary timetable, in spite of the fact that the arranged every other month issues were still in some cases postponed. Hamilton paid 21 shillings (ÃÂ£1.05) per thousand words, the likeness three tenths of a penny for every word; this was a low rate contrasted with the American market, however was possibly superior to the contemporary British magazine "Bona fide Science Fiction", which paid ÃÂ£1 per thousand words. Hamilton offered a reward of ÃÂ£2 or ÃÂ£5 to the story that ended up being the perusers' most loved in each issue, which pulled in essayists; and he later expanded the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 pennies) per word for surely understood writers. This was higher than the best UK markets, for example, "New Worlds", and was near the rates paid by the top magazines in the US around then. Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's eagerness to work with new writers were intended to urge journalists to present their work to "Cloud" before attempting different magazines.
