Factories' and Cleveland's annihilation on the levy bill could be viewed as a triumph for Randall, yet the vote indicated how secluded the previous Speaker's protectionist thoughts presently made him in his gathering: just four Democrats casted a ballot against the duty decreases. The state party similarly betrayed Randall and toward unhindered commerce, embracing an ace tax modification stage at the 1888 state Democratic tradition. In the meantime, Randall apparently turned around his long-standing duty to financial economy by casting a ballot with the Republicans to abrogate Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given an annuity to each Union veteran (or their widows) who guaranteed he could never again perform physical work, paying little mind to whether his handicap was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in accordance with his record of little government cost-cutting, with which Randall would typically have identified. Randall, maybe with an end goal to pick up support with veterans in his locale, joined the Republicans in an ineffective endeavor to supersede Cleveland's veto. Another plausibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the government spending surplus as motivation to cut levies; by expanding bureaucratic spending, he wanted to diminish the surplus and keep up the requirement for high taxes. Whatever the reason, the endeavor fizzled and left Randall further distanced from his kindred Democrats.
