At the episode of World War I, Kulikovsky was sent to the front with his regiment. Michael was reviewed from abroad, and Olga got down to business in a military medical clinic as an attendant. Olga kept on squeezing the Tsar to permit her separation. In a letter she composed, "...finish with the separation now amid the war while everyone's eyes and brains are involved somewhere elseÃ¢ÂÂand such a little thing would be lost in all the more noteworthy things". The war went seriously for the Russian royal powers, and the Central Powers, driven by Germany, progressed into Russia. Afraid for Kulikovsky's security, Olga begged the Tsar to exchange him to the general wellbeing of Kiev, where she was positioned at an emergency clinic. In 1916, in the wake of visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar authoritatively abrogated her marriage to Duke Peter, and she wedded Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Just the administering minister, Olga's mom the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother by marriage Grand Duke Alexander, two individual medical caretakers from the clinic in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was privileged colonel, visited. Their fourteen day special first night was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had a place with family companions of the Kulikovskys. Subsequent to visiting Kulikovsky's folks and grandma in Kharkov, Olga and Kulikovsky came back to Kiev.
