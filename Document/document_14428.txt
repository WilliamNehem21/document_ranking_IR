In May 1908, Archibald Leitch kept in touch with the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) Ã¢ÂÂ who had a rail stop adjoining the proposed site for the football ground Ã¢ÂÂ trying to influence them to sponsor development of the show off close by the railroad line. The appropriation would have gone to the whole of ÃÂ£10,000, to be paid back at the rate of ÃÂ£2,000 "per annum" for a long time or half of the entryway receipts for the show off every year until the advance was reimbursed. Notwithstanding, regardless of certifications for the credit originating from the club itself and two neighborhood distilleries, both led by club executive John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposition down. The CLC had wanted to construct another station neighboring the new arena, with the guarantee of a foreseen ÃÂ£2,750 "per annum" in charges counterbalancing the ÃÂ£9,800 cost of structure the station. The station Ã¢ÂÂ Trafford Park Ã¢ÂÂ was in the end assembled, however sometime later than initially arranged. The CLC later developed an unobtrusive station with one timber-fabricated stage promptly contiguous the arena and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was at first named United Football Ground, however was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in mid 1936. It was served on match days just by a bus administration of steam trains from Manchester Central railroad station. It is as of now known as Manchester United Football Ground.
