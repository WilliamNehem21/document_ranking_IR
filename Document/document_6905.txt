De Ros got "seisin" of his domains on 11 February 1394, which included care of a few Clifford family homes; his sister had hitched Thomas de Clifford, sixth Baron de Clifford around 1379. He held the last grounds until their child became an adult around 1411. De Ros wedded Margaret, girl of John Fitzalan, first Baron Arundel and Eleanor Maltravers, not long after he acquired. She was at that point in receipt of a 40-mark annuity from King Richard II since she had been in the family unit of Richard's as of late perished ruler, Anne of Bohemia. His better half gave de Ros what may have gave off an impression of being a helpful association with the crown. Likewise helpful to William was the way that his better half's dad had as of late kicked the bucket, so de Ros presently had the Earl of Arundel as a brother by marriage. His new associations and the higher political profile they brought may represent the illustrious awards he before long got of Clifford houses in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Worcestershire. These had been the dower terrains of Euphemia (widow of Robert, Lord Clifford), who had kicked the bucket in November 1393. De Ros went to the lord's wedding to his second spouseÃ¢ÂÂthe French King's girl, Isabella of ValoisÃ¢ÂÂin Calais in December 1396. His better half's granddad kicked the bucket the next year, and she moved toward becoming Lady Maltravers "suo jure".
