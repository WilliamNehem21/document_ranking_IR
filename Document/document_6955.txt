Because of the flare-up of World War I, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters were brought out of save and prepared as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" filled in as the lead of the squadron. The boats were prepared for war in all respects gradually, and they were not prepared for administration in the North Sea until the finish of August. They were at first entrusted with beach front safeguard, however they served in this limit with regards to a brief timeframe. In mid-September, the V Squadron was exchanged to the Baltic, under the direction of Prince Heinrich. He at first intended to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable ambush on Windau, yet a deficiency of transports constrained an amendment of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival compel, yet this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters came back to Kiel the next day, landed the arrival power, and afterward continued toward the North Sea, where they continued gatekeeper deliver obligations.
