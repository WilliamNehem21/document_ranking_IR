In the afterword of the 1999 Harper Perennial Modern Classics version, Dillard states that the book's other, two-section structure reflects the two courses to God as indicated by Neoplatonic Christianity: the "by means of positiva" and the "through negativa". The primary portion of the book, the "by means of positiva", starting with the second part, "amasses the world's decency and God's." The second a large portion of, the "by means of negativa", closes with the section "Northing" which Dillard notes is the partner of the second part, "Seeing". The first and last sections of the book fill in as the presentation and end, individually. The account is made out of vignettes itemizing the storyteller's wanderings around the stream. In "The Present" the storyteller experiences a pup at a service station off the roadway, and praises its paunch while thinking about the perspective on the adjacent mountain run; the intelligent demonstration of "petting the young doggie" is alluded to in a few different sections. In "Stalking", the storyteller seeks after a gathering of muskrats in the spring amid summer. A standout amongst the most celebrated entries originates from the earliest starting point of the book, when the storyteller observes a frog being depleted and eaten up by a water bug.
