The choice has been broadly reprimanded by legitimate researchers. David E. Wilkins noticed that if the Indian Commerce Clause or Taxation Clause did not contain the specialist, and the clans had not conceded it by arrangement or assent, at that point the Major Crimes Act would be illegal and the Court ought to have proclaimed it void. Phillip P. Frickey depicts the "Kagama" choice as "a hurricane of round thinking", with the Court defending congressional power because of the clan's shortcoming, which it likewise noted was because of the clans managing the U.S. government. Frickey felt the choice was a shame to sacred hypothesis, to rationale, and to mankind. Robert N. Clinton expressed that "<nowiki>[t]</nowiki>his surprising choice clearly conjured talk of provincial development, as opposed to the talk of American protected talk." Daniel L. Rotenberg said that "Kagama" was "one all the more thing on the long reiteration of treacheries to the American Indian." notwithstanding the law educators, different creators in law audits have likewise been disparaging of the choice. Warren Stapleton, in the Arizona State University law diary, has expressed that the choice was wrong and that the Major Crimes Act is in certainty illegal. In a Comment, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review noticed that "the Court declared what can be known as the 'it-must-be-some place' doctrineÃÂ ..."
