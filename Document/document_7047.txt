Adversary experiences trigger a battle mode. As in "Chrono Trigger", adversaries are straightforwardly obvious on field maps or lie in hang tight to snare the gathering and in this manner are not arbitrary. Like "Last Fantasy"s Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that step by step loads up with time. At the point when the meter is full, characters can physically assault adversaries, use MysTech enchantment, release BattleSkill assaults, use things, move to an alternate position, or utilize a close-by item to assault, if present. For playable characters and PC controlled adversaries, each assault has their number of hit focuses (a numerically based life bar) get decreased, which can be reestablished through mending things or MysTech slags. Utilization of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a different vitality save showed underneath a character's life bar. NRG is recharged through specific things. Utilization of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar underneath NRG that naturally loads up with time; players can utilize distinctive BattleSkills relying upon how full the Bouge bar is. A few characters must experience certain plot advancements to open their BattleSkills. At the point when a playable character loses all hit focuses, the individual blacks out. On the off chance that all the player's characters fall in fight, the diversion closes and should be reestablished from a recently spared amusement. Winning fights gains experience focuses and raises characters' dimensions, giving them improved measurements. These measurements can be seen through the status screen, which shows critical character data and current journeys. Dissimilar to numerous different RPGs, "Anachronox" shows a character's properties with subjective descriptors, (for example, Poor and Excellent) rather than numbers.
