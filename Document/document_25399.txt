The center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed and all of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen guns in four triple-gun turrets and ten AA guns in single turrets. In addition the ships were fitted with fifteen 54-caliber Breda light AA guns in six twin-gun and three single mounts and sixteen Breda Model 35 AA guns, also in twin mounts. The 305-millimeter guns were bored out to 320 millimeters (12.6Â in) and their turrets were modified to use electric power. They had a fixed loading angle of +12 degrees, but there is uncertainty on their new maximum elevation, with some sources citing a maximum value of +27 degrees, while others claim one of +30 degrees. The 320-millimeter AP shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of . In early 1942 the rearmost 20-millimeter mounts were replaced by twin 37-millimeter gun mounts and the 20-millimeter guns were moved to the roof of Turret 'B', while the RPC motors from the stabilized mounts of the 90Â mm guns were removed. The forward superstructure was rebuilt with a new forward conning tower, protected with thick armor. Atop the conning tower there was a fire-control director fitted with three large rangefinders.
