In January 1941 the British Army started making arrangements for activities in Greece. Fairley and his British partner, Colonel J. S. K. Boyd, the counseling pathologist, drafted a restorative appreciation. Drawing on the experience of the Salonika front in the First World War, where exceptionally substantial losses experienced intestinal sickness, in addition to Fairley's later involvement in that piece of the world, they painted a desolate picture, stressing the grave dangers, and venturing to such an extreme as to propose that the Germans may endeavor to tempt the partners into a late spring effort in which they could be wrecked by jungle fever. The British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell discredited their report as "run of the mill of a very non-medicinal and non-military soul", yet an eye to eye meeting with Boyd and Fairley persuaded Wavell that they were not kidding and not just uncooperative, and Wavell guaranteed his help with relieving the risk. The crusade plan was modified to position united powers further south, far from the fields of Macedonia and the Vardar and Struma River bowls, where jungle fever was hyper-endemic and substantial losses had been experienced intestinal sickness by British troops amid the First World War.
