Different survives from comparable creatures were found all through the late nineteenth century and twentieth century. Another very much safeguarded skeleton from the marginally more established Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named "T. warreni" by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had striking contrasts from "T. neglectus", thus Charles M. Sternberg set it in another variety, "Parksosaurus", in 1937. Sternberg likewise named an extra species, "T. edmontonensis", in view of another verbalized skeleton, this time including an incomplete skull (NMCÃÂ 8537), and attracted consideration regarding the sort's overwhelming form and thick bones. Because of these distinctions from the customary light hypsilophodont fabricate, he recommended that the sort justified its very own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. "T. edmontonensis" has, since Peter Galton's 1974 audit, for the most part been viewed as a progressively hearty individual (potentially the contrary sex of the sort individual) of "T. neglectus". In any case, Boyd and associates found that they couldn't appoint it to both of their legitimate types of "Thescelosaurus" and viewed the example as of dubious situation inside the variety. The other purpose of conflict with respect to "T. edmontonensis" is its lower leg, which Galton asserted was harmed and misjudged, however which was respected by William J. Morris (1976) as genuinely not the same as "T. neglectus".
