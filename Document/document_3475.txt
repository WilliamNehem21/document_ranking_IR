In "Conclusive Fantasy XIII-2", Lightning has vanished, and everything except Serah trust that she passed on with Vanille and Fang to spare Cocoon. In actuality, Lightning was conveyed to Valhalla, capital of the Unseen Realm controlled by the Goddess Etro, as an immediate consequence of Etro discharging her and the others from their destiny as l'Cie. These occasions had twisted time and deleted Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall. Planning to give penance for the passings she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning remains in Valhalla and shield the diminishing Etro from Caius Ballad, an interminable man with resentment against the goddess. Lightning in the end asks Noel Kreiss and Serah to help her prevent Caius from terminating time, which he intends to do by discharging "Disarray", an extraordinary vitality constrained by Etro, into the human world. Serah and Noel make a trip forward so as to fix twists in history brought about by Caius' impedance, and Serah in the long run bites the dust when history is reestablished. In the DLC scene "Memorial of the Goddess", Lightning is vanquished by Caius and loses trust subsequent to learning of her job in Serah's passing. Lightning is ameliorated by Serah's soul, who asks not to be overlooked. Vowing to save Serah's memory, Lightning swings to precious stone, which keeps her from being influenced when Etro's passing discharges tumult and consolidations the human and concealed domains together.
