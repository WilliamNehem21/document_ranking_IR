On his approach to Australia in October 1973, Lamb ceased off in South Africa and Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), where he slice his movements short to enroll in the Rhodesian Army. As indicated by Barker, Lamb made a trip to Africa with this expectation from the start. Rhodesia's unrecognized and transcendently white government was around then battling a war against socialist sponsored dark patriot guerrillas who were endeavoring to persuasively present greater part rule. Like the majority of the outside volunteers in the Rhodesian powers, Lamb marshaled into the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando brigade connected to a great extent in counter-rebellion tasks. He and the other remote warriors got indistinguishable pay and states of administration from the Rhodesians they served close by. "In numerous regards the RLI was a reflection of the French Foreign Legion, in that enrollment specialists paid little notice as to a man's past and made no inquiries," composes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, "and like the Foreign Legion, once in the positions, a man's past was unessential." So it demonstrated for Lamb; keeping his previous a mystery, he turned into a very respected and well known individual from 3 Commando, RLI, noted for his polished skill and physical wellness. "The Rhodesians thought he was a five star fighter," Barker later told the "Globe and Mail".
