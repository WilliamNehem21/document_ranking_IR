At the point when Angelou stated "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" toward the finish of the 1960s, one of the vital and acknowledged highlights of writing, as per pundit Pierre A. Walker, was topical solidarity. One of Angelou's objectives was to make a book that fulfilled this model, so as to accomplish her political purposes, which were to show how to oppose prejudice in America. The structure of the content, which takes after a progression of short stories, isn't ordered yet rather topical. Walker, in his 1993 article about "Confined Bird", "Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form", centers around the book's structure, and portrays how it underpins her introduction of bigotry. As indicated by Walker, pundits had disregarded dissecting its structure, concentrating rather on its topics, which he feels ignores the political idea of the book. He states, "One serves Angelou and "Confined Bird" better by underscoring how structure and political substance cooperate". Angelou structures her book with the goal that it shows a progression of exercises about how to oppose bigotry and mistreatment. The movement Maya experiences specifically brings together the book, something that "remains as opposed to the generally long winded nature of the story". The manner by which Angelou develops, orchestrates, and sorts out her vignettes regularly undermined the sequence of her adolescence by "comparing the occasions of one section with the occasions of going before and following ones so they also remark on one another".
