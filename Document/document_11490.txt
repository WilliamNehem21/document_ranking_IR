The 80,000-man Army of Sambre and Meuse officially held the west bank of the Rhine as far south as the Nahe and afterward southwest to Sankt Wendel. On the military's left (northern) flank, Jean Baptiste KlÃÂ©ber had 22,000 troops in a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Rhine in a settled in camp at DÃÂ¼sseldorf.
