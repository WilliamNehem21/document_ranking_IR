A medium-sized oryzomyine, "Pennatomys" is known from various skeletal stays, a large number of which are fragmentary. Both skull and postcranial bones are spoken to. In spite of the fact that there are no bizarre adjustments in the known material, the creature has a blend of qualities that recognize it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known just from sections. The nasal bones reach out back to a point previously or marginally behind the point where the maxillary, frontal, and lacrimal bones meet, and have a dull back edge. The nasals expand somewhat further back than the premaxillaries. The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries, an attribute that recognizes "Pennatomys" from its nearest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating predominantly with the frontals). The interorbital locale of the skull bears feeble peaks at its sides. The zygomatic plate, a hard plate along the edge of the skull, is expansive and its back edge is situated before the primary upper molar (M1). The sharp foramina, openings in the hard sense of taste, stretch out back to a point alongside the front foundation of M1. The sense of taste itself is long and level, reaching out past the third upper molars (M3). In the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular procedureÃ¢ÂÂa bulge at the back of the jawbone that houses the foundation of the lower incisor. Beneath the molars, the upper and lower masseteric edges (peaks which bolster a portion of the biting muscles) are now and again conjoined towards the front, and they stretch out forward to a point underneath the primary lower molar (m1). The conjoined peaks are one of the synapomorphic (shared-determined) characters of the "Nectomys" subclade.
