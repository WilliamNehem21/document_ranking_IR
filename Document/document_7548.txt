Asser is the sole hotspot for the question among ÃÂthelwulf and ÃÂthelbald, which isn't referenced in the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle", and as per Asser when ÃÂthelwulf came back to England he consented to partition the kingdom to maintain a strategic distance from a common war. Most students of history express that ÃÂthelbald kept Wessex while ÃÂthelberht consented to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to ÃÂthelwulf, despite the fact that Simon Keynes feels that ÃÂthelwulf kept a level of power. A few students of history contend that almost certainly, Wessex itself was separated, with ÃÂthelbald keeping his capacity base west of Selwood, ÃÂthelwulf taking the east and ÃÂthelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby call attention to that Asser infers that Judith progressed toward becoming ruler of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller sees that Asser griped that the "child ruled where by legitimate judgment the dad ought to have done; for the western piece of the Saxon land has dependably could really compare to the eastern", and since Kent had just been vanquished thirty years already, it didn't bode well to talk about it as having dependably been a less critical piece of the kingdom.
