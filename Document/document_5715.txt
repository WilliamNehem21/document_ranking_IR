The sections concentrating on the Old Testament concern the formation of the world, the Fall of Man, the Great Flood, and the Exodus from Egypt. Proba's introduction of the Creationlargely dependent on rewordings of Virgil's "Georgics"reorganizes the Genesis story to all the more likely adjust it to contemporary Greco-Roman convictions about the inception of the world. Cullhed contends that specific parts of the creation story are "condensed ... intensified or even transposed" so that Proba can maintain a strategic distance from tedious entries, for example, the twofold production of man (Genesis 1:25Ã¢ÂÂ 27 and Genesis 2:18Ã¢ÂÂ 19). In the occasions prompting the Fall of Man, Eve's activities are to a great extent dependent on the account of Dido from Book IV of the "Aeneid", in this manner "more than once foretelling ... the inescapable debacle of the Fall". The Serpent is portrayed with lines that detail LaocoÃÂ¶n's passing (from Book II, "Aeneid") and the snake sent by the fierceness Alecto to irritate Amata (from Book VII, "Aeneid"). Proba depends on the initial two books of the "Georgics" (explicitly, the segments that examine the Iron Age of Man) to portray human life after Adam and Eve eat the natural product from the tree of the learning of good and malevolence; along these lines, she interfaces the Greco-Roman idea of the Ages of Man with the Judeo-Christian idea of the Fall of Man.
