The twelve 45-bore 14-inch firearms of the "FusÃÂ" class were mounted in six twin-weapon turrets, numbered from front to raise, every one of which weighed . The turrets had a height capacity of Ã¢ÂÂ5/+20 degrees. They were orchestrated in an unprecedented 2-1-1-2 style with superfiring sets of turrets fore and toward the back; the center turrets were not superfiring, and had a channel between them. The choice to utilize six twin turrets instead of four triple turrets extraordinarily influenced the whole structure of the class in light of the fact that the two additional turrets required a more drawn out ship and expanded the measure of shield required to secure the ship. The area of the third and fourth turrets demonstrated especially tricky to the structure of the class in light of the fact that the amidships turrets were not superfiring as in the resulting s. This further expanded the length of the boats on the grounds that the barrels of the upper turret did not jut over the lower turret, requiring more space than a couple of superfiring turrets. Mounted amidships along the centerline of the ship, they had confined circular segments of flame, and their position constrained the engine compartments to be set in under perfect areas. Another inconvenience was the need to fit additional protection and cooling in the magazines of the amidships turrets to shield them from the warmth created in the contiguous engine compartments. Initially both amidship firearm turrets looked to the back, however "FusÃÂ"s turret No. 3 was moved to look ahead amid her recreation so as to suit extra stages around her channel.
