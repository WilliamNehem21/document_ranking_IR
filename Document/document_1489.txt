When it was re-shaped as No.ÃÂ 1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had additionally been made in charge of preparing the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this job was exchanged to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-framed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28ÃÂ May 1958, No.ÃÂ 1 AFTS moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were supplanted by deÃÂ Havilland Vampire fly mentors, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.ÃÂ 1 BFTS, which exchanged from Uranquinty on 19ÃÂ December. At this point the RAAF had chosen to commission all pilots and guides, who might be chosen for these jobs upon acceptance into the administration; guides along these lines went directly to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without going to flying preparing school. On 31ÃÂ December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight guidance segment of the four-year cadet course turned into the duty of No.ÃÂ 1 BFTS (for fundamental preparing) and No.ÃÂ 1 AFTS (for cutting edge preparing). Already, the cadets had utilized FTS flying machine under RAAF College educators, yet from 1959 their flight preparing was completely incorporated with the FTS framework.
