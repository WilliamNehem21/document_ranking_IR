"GameSpot" Greg Kasavin spoke highly of the tight controls and accessible gameplay in spite of a larger learning curve. IGN's Goldstein described the controls as "relatively simple" and easy to understand within a single game, and Scott Osborne of "GameSpy" found the controls awkward but easily learned. In comparison, Charles Herold of "The New York Times" and a friend could not figure out Blitz's rules for 20 minutes, feeling "too macho" to do the tutorial. "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" Jonathan Silver thought the gameplay was too frenzied, like ""NHL Hitz" on steroids". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's looseness. She noted the game's "serious attitude" and "very gritty view of sports", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was "one of the nicest aspects" of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded "Deathrow"s profanity as the "best use of endless cursing in a game... ever". Herold of "The New York Times" noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the "savage profanities", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games. He added that the game's frantic speed kept him too consumed to curse at the game himself. "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" Troy Oxford also connected the profanity to the game's "'M' rating".
