With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris. In November 1889, playing music by Chopin, he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by EugÃ¨ne Anthiome. Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student. Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period "of immense growth... from adolescence to maturity." 
In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de BÃ©riot, for piano, and Ãmile Pessard, for harmony. He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from BÃ©riot but, in the words of the musical scholar Barbara L. Kelly, he "was only teachable on his own terms". His later teacher Gabriel FaurÃ© understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s. Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes. His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: "SÃ©rÃ©nade grotesque", for piano, and "Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer", a "mÃ©lodie" setting a poem by Roland de MarÃ¨s (both 1893).
