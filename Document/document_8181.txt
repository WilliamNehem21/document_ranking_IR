Prost reviewed that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one vehicle with perhaps four or five mechanics, while his colleague had two autos and 20 individuals around him. Before the race Prost, who had declared in July 1989 that he would leave from McLaren, reported he was joining Ferrari. Despite the fact that Prost was compelled to make an open expression of remorse to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza remarks, he got support from Nigel Mansell (who might be his colleague at Ferrari), and previous partner Rosberg who guaranteed that once it ended up realized they would not be utilizing the Japanese motors the following season, their Honda motors did not appear to fill in just as was once ordinary. Prost really won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's motor blew with just 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a counterpart for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, particularly those in the press, thinking about whether there was really truth to Prost's case that his Honda motors were not in the same class as the ones Senna had the capacity to utilize.
