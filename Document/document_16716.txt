On stamps, the name of the state has always been written in Irish and rarely also written in English. The overprints were stamped first "Rialtas Sealadach na hÃireann" ("Provisional Government of Ireland") and later "SaorstÃ¡t Ãireann" ("Irish Free State"). Subsequent stamps nearly all used the name "Ãire" ("Ireland"), even though this was not the name of the state until the 1937 Constitution took effect. The exceptions were issued in 1949 and 1950, and used "POBLAÄT NA hÃIREANN" or "Poblacht na h-Ãireann" ("Republic of Ireland"). This phrase is the official "description" of the state specified in the Republic of Ireland Act, which came into force in April 1949; the state's "name" was not changed by the Act. Fianna FÃ¡il defeated the outgoing government in the 1951 election and abandoned the use of the description, reverting to the name on stamps and elsewhere. Originally, "Ãire" was written in Gaelic type; from 1952 to 1979, many stamps had the name of the state in Roman type, usually in all caps, and often written "EIRE" rather than "ÃIRE", omitting the "sÃ­neadh fada" accent over the initial 'E'. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recommended the inclusion of the word "Ireland" along with "Ãire" on stamps but the Department of the Taoiseach vetoed the idea on the basis it could cause "constitutional and political repercussions" and that "the change could be unwelcome."
