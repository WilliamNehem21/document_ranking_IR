In present day times Cleopatra has turned into a symbol of mainstream culture, a notoriety molded by dramatic portrayals going back to the Renaissance just as depictions and movies. This material to a great extent outperforms the degree and size of existent historiographic writing about her from traditional vestige and has had a more noteworthy effect on the overall population's perspective on Cleopatra than the last mentioned. The fourteenth century English artist Geoffrey Chaucer, in "The Legend of Good Women", contextualized Cleopatra for the Christian universe of the Middle Ages. His portrayal of Cleopatra and Antony, her sparkling knight occupied with elegant love, has been translated in present day times as being either fun loving or sexist parody. Be that as it may, Chaucer featured Cleopatra's associations with just two men as scarcely the life of a temptress and composed his works mostly in response to the negative delineation of Cleopatra in and , Latin works by the fourteenth century Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. The Renaissance humanist , in his 1504 "Lyrics apologetico delle donne", was the main Italian to shield the notoriety of Cleopatra and censure the apparent admonishing and misogyny in Boccaccio's works. Works of Islamic historiography written in Arabic secured the rule of Cleopatra, for example, the tenth century "Knolls of Gold" by Al-Masudi, in spite of the fact that his work incorrectly guaranteed that Octavian passed on not long after Cleopatra's suicide.
