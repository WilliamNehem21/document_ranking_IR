"Drakengard" opens with Caim amidst a fight to shield his sister from the Empire. Amid the fight, Caim is harmed, and heading off to Furiae's manor discovers Angelus seriously injured from torment. Regardless of their common question, Caim and Angelus consent to make an agreement and spare one another. In the wake of repulsing the assault, Furiae and Inuart run with Caim to discover security, experiencing Verdelet on their movements. Inuart is caught, tormented and mentally programmed by Manah, inevitably capturing Furiae in the conviction that he can spare her from her destiny as the Goddess and gain her affection. Verdelet and Caim travel to every one of the three Seals, yet each time arrive past the point where it is possible to stop them being devastated. In the long run, the Union and the Empire take part in fight and the Union are triumphant. After the fight, in any case, the Union's enduring troops are demolished by an obscure power and the Empire's troops come back to life. Caim and Angelus travel to a post that has showed up in the sky, where they find that Furiae has murdered herself, breaking the last seal. Inuart, seeing her body, is discharged from his mentally programming and removes her.
