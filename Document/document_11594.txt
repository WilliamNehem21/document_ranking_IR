On 13 October 2005, the Swedish Academy declared that it had chosen to grant the Nobel Prize in Literature for that year to Pinter, who "in his plays reveals the cliff under ordinary jabber and powers section into abuse's shut rooms". Its choice induced some open debate and analysis relating both to attributes of Pinter's work and to his governmental issues. At the point when met that day about his response to the declaration, Pinter stated: "I was told today that one of the Sky channels said toward the beginning of today that 'Harold Pinter is dead.' Then they altered their opinion and stated, 'No, he's won the Nobel prize.' So I've become alive once again." The Nobel Prize Awards Ceremony and related occasions all through Scandinavia occurred in December 2005. After the Academy told Pinter of his honor, he had wanted to make a trip to Stockholm to introduce his Nobel Lecture face to face. In November, in any case, his specialist sent him to medical clinic and banned such travel, after a genuine contamination was analyzed. Pinter's distributer, Stephen Page of Faber and Faber, acknowledged the Nobel Diploma and Nobel Medal at the Awards Ceremony in his place.
