Mick St. John, a private specialist, longs for being met by a lady off-camera, where he uncovers that he is 90 years of age, and that not at all like different vampires, he has norms and does not chase ladies, youngsters or blameless people. Mick's activity drives him to the scene of the homicide of a young lady, where Beth, a journalist for the online paper "BuzzWire", sees two huge cut injuries on the lady's neck. While strolling around the scene, she meets Mick and discloses to him he looks exceptionally commonplace, yet he demands that they don't have any acquaintance with one another. Beth gives the homicide article a vampire subject, utilizing the cut injuries as motivation. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire companion of Mick's, worried for the security of vampires. To get more data on the homicide, Mick goes to the funeral home, where his companion Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not identify any hints of vampire contact on the dead lady, dispensing with them as her reason of death. Mick at that point runs over Beth at the dead lady's loft, where they discover a jewelry with a vial of blood inside.
