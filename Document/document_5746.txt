Vulcan and the Bird-of-Prey outside was made with a mix of matte sketches and a soundstage. Nimoy had looked for a reasonable area for the scene of the "Venture" group's arrangements to come back to Earth, however different areas did not work, so the scene was rather shot on a Paramount backlot. The creation needed to cover the way that generation structures were away. A wide-edge shot of Spock on the edge of a precipice sitting above the scene was taped at Vasquez Rocks, a recreation center north of Los Angeles. The Federation board chamber was an expansive set loaded up with agents from many outsider races. Creation supervisor Jack T. Collis conserved by structure the set with just a single end; turn around point shots utilized a similar bit of divider. The places of the Federation President's platform and the performing artists on the seats were exchanged for each shot. Since "The Voyage Home" was the main "Star Trek" film to demonstrate the tasks at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to figure out how a genuine profound space war room may look and work. Among the subsequent set's highlights was a substantial focal work area with video screens that the creation group nicknamed "the pool table"; the prop later turned into an installation in USS "Venture"- D's motor room on the TV arrangement "Star Trek: The Next Generation".
