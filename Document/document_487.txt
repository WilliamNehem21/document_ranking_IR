Impulse for the section of a three-penny coin came when Congress, in January 1851, considered lessening postage rates from five pennies to three. In 1849, House Committee on Ways and Means executive, Samuel Vinton, had written to Mint chief Robert M. Patterson that his board of trustees was thinking about both diminishing the postage rate and establishing a three-penny coin. Albeit no authoritative move was then made, Patterson had the mint plan test design coins. The House board proposing the 1851 bill incorporated Dickinson's three-penny piece, and gave that it be legitimate delicate up to 30 pennies. At the point when the bill was bantered in the House on January 13, 1851, New York Congressman William Duer showed that he felt both coin and stamp ought to be named at 2 pennies, and his individual New Yorker, Orsamus Matteson, offered a change with that impact. The alteration bombed, as did each other endeavor to change the enactment, including Dickinson's supplication, in the Senate, to reestablish the prerequisite that the new coin be utilized to resign a portion of the Spanish silver. The bill passed the two houses, and turned into the Act of March 3, 1851 when President Millard Fillmore marked it.
