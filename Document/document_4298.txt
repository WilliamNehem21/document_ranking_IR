Subsequent to winning the class title in 1899, Villa's record-breaking normal horde of 21,000 enabled the club to put resources into a two-arrange ground improvement program. The primary stage expanded the porch covering on the Trinity Road side at the expense of ÃÂ£887; the second expense ÃÂ£1,300 and included re-laying all terracing around the track to cure a structure defect that caused poor sightlines for most of the group. In 1911, Villa purchased the freehold of the ground for ÃÂ£8,250, the places of business in the old aquarium and vehicle leave territory for ÃÂ£1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for ÃÂ£2,000. This was the principal arrange in plans drawn up by Villa chief Frederick Rinder that saw the limit of Villa Park expanded to 104,000. In June 1914, another period of upgrades started at Villa Park to contend with enhancements at different grounds around the nation, including Everton's Goodison Park, where another two-layered stand had quite recently been finished. The main phase of upgrades saw the cycling track expelled, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to convey it closer to the recently squared-off pitch. Rinder swung to the famous engineer Archibald Leitch to plan another Villa Park. Their joint plans included extensive banked end remains at the Holte and Witton closes and the fuse of the first Victorian Lower Grounds structures, including the aquarium and the recently obtained bowling greens. The flare-up of the First World War seriously hampered structure and development endeavors.
