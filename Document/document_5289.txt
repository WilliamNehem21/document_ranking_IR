Reenactments of 15 realized articles developing affected by Planet Nine likewise uncovered contrasts with perceptions. Cory Shankman and his partners included Planet Nine of every a reproduction of numerous clones (objects with comparative circles) of 15 objects with semi-significant pivot > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU. While they watched arrangement of the circles inverse that of Planet Nine's for the items with semi-real hub more prominent than 250 AU, grouping of the contentions of perihelion was not seen. Their reenactments additionally demonstrated that the perihelia of the eTNOs rose and fell easily, leaving numerous with perihelion separates between 50 AU and 70 AU where none had been watched, and anticipated that there would be numerous other surreptitiously questions. These incorporated a substantial repository of high-tendency articles that would have been missed because of most perceptions being at little tendencies, and an extensive populace of items with perihelia so far off that they would be too swoon to even consider observing. A considerable lot of the articles were additionally shot out from the Solar System subsequent to experiencing the other goliath planets. The huge in secret populaces and the loss of numerous items drove Shankman et al. to evaluate that the mass of the first populace was several Earth masses, necessitating that an a lot bigger mass had been shot out amid the early Solar System. Shankman et al. reasoned that the presence of Planet Nine is improbable and that the at present watched arrangement of the current eTNOs is an impermanent marvel that will vanish as more items are recognized.
