"Original Stories" was first published anonymously in 1788, the same year as Wollstonecraft's first novel "", and cost two shillings. When the second edition came out in 1791, Wollstonecraft's name was printed on the title page; after the publication in 1790 of her "Vindication of the Rights of Men", she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales. Joseph Johnson, the publisher of "Original Stories" and all of Wollstonecraft's other works, commissioned William Blake to design six illustrations for the second edition, which cost two shillings and six pence. It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print. According to Gary Kelly, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, the last edition of "Original Stories" was published in 1820, but without Wollstonecraft's name on the title page; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband, William Godwin, had revealed her unorthodox lifestyle in his "Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1798). According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the "Masterworks of Children's Literature" series, "Original Stories" was published until 1835. It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795.
