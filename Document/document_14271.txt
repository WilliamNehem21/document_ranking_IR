The Coalition's situation at Kehl was humbly guarded. On 24 June Louis Desaix's development assemble assaulted the clobbered Swabian farmhands there on the scaffold, going before the fundamental power of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 rangers. In the First Battle of Kehl the 10,065 French troops associated with the underlying attack lost just 150 losses. The Swabians were dwarfed and couldn't be strengthened. The majority of the Imperial Army of the Rhine had stayed close Mannheim, where Charles foreseen the important assault. Neither the CondÃÂ©'s troops in Freiburg im Breisgau nor Karl Aloys zu FÃÂ¼rstenberg's power in Rastatt could reach Kehl so as to help them. The Swabians endured 700 losses and lost 14 weapons and 22 ammo wagons. Moreau strengthened his recently won bridgehead on 26Ã¢ÂÂ 27 June with the goal that he had 30,000 troops to restrict just 18,000 privately based Coalition troops. Leaving Delaborde's division on the west bank to watch the Rhine between Neuf-Brisach and HÃÂ¼ningen, Moreau moved toward the north against Latour. Isolated from their administrator, the Austrian left flank under FrÃÂ¶hlich and the CondÃÂ© pulled back toward the southeast. At Renchen on 28 June, Desaix made up for lost time with SztÃÂ¡ray's segment of 9,000 Austrian and Reichsarmee (Imperial) troops. For just 200 of their own setbacks, the French dispensed misfortunes of 550 executed and injured, while catching 850 men, seven firearms and two ammo wagons.
