The proprietors quickly attempted to squash the association. Toronto proprietor Conn Smythe contrasted the players relationship with socialism: "I feel that anything brought forth in mystery as this affiliation was positively must have some smell to it." Red Wings president Bruce Norris reacted by exchanging Lindsay to his sibling's group, the Black Hawks. The move was broadly observed as reformatory, as the Hawks had completed toward the end in the NHL each season, spare one, from 1949 until 1957. Lindsay was by all account not the only player sent to Chicago as discipline; Glenn Hall was incorporated as he wouldn't remove himself from Lindsay. In Toronto, Smythe over and over sidelined Jim Thomson, who was the association's secretary, before likewise giving him to the Black Hawks. The Players' Association reacted by documenting a $3ÃÂ million antitrust claim against the NHL. Induced by colleagues Gordie Howe and Red Kelly, the Red Wings players casted a ballot to pull back from the relationship in November 1957. Different groups immediately pursued, and the association yielded. Association initiative at last consented to drop the claim in return for little concessions, which incorporated a base yearly compensation of $7,000, increments to the annuity commitments and moving costs for exchanged players.
