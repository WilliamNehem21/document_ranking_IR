Inquiries regarding Farmer's utilization of citizen subsidizes kept on hounding him all through the general race battle. Democrats requested that Farmer repay the state for inn costs charged to the state while Farmer was directing effort exercises at the KHSAA state b-ball competition and the Kentucky State Fair, both found less than from his home. In May, the workplace of Democratic State Auditor Crit Luallen informed the Internal Revenue Service that Farmer had neglected to report individual utilization of his state vehicle as salary. A representative for Farmer's office said that the individual mileage had been followed, yet a division worker had neglected to advance it to the state Personnel Cabinet for announcing; he included that Farmer would record changed duty archives and have derivations taken from his wages to settle the expense risk. The state Democratic Party recorded a morals protest against Farmer in September dependent on an unknown email sent to the Personnel Cabinet asserting that, after work hours, Farmer guided an agribusiness division worker to buy a little cooler with state reserves and convey it to Farmer's home. A division representative said Farmer invested a generous measure of energy working from a home office in 2010 because of back damage and that the icebox had been moved to office workplaces in 2011.
