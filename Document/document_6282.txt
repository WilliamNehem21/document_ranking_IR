The almost total first example was cleaned and mounted at the UCMP under supervision of the American scientist Wann Langston Jr., a procedure that took three men two years. The skeleton was divider mounted in bas alleviation, with the tail bended upwards, the neck rectified, and the left leg climbed for perceivability, however the remainder of the skeleton was kept in its entombment position. As the skull was squashed, it was recreated dependent on the back of the skull of the principal example and the front of the second. The pelvis was recreated after that of "Allosaurus", and the feet were likewise remade. At the time, it was a standout amongst the best-safeguarded skeletons of a theropod dinosaur, however deficient. In 1954 the American scientist Samuel P. Welles, who was a piece of the gathering that unearthed the skeletons, for starters portrayed and named this dinosaur as another species in the current variety "Megalosaurus", "M.wetherilli". The about total example (indexed as UCMP37302) turned into the holotype, and the second example (UCMP37303) was incorporated into the hypodigm (the example of examples that characterizes a taxon) of the animal groups. The particular name regarded John Wetherill, a Navajo councilor whom Welles depicted as a "voyager, companion of researchers, and confided in dealer". It was Wetherill's nephew, Milton, who had first educated the campaign of the fossils. Welles set the new species in "Megalosaurus" because of the comparable appendage extents of it and "M.bucklandii", and in light of the fact that he didn't discover incredible contrasts between them. At the time, "Megalosaurus" was utilized as a "wastebasket taxon", wherein numerous types of theropod were set, paying little heed to their age or area.
