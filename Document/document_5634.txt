The second period of sanctuary building was at Aihole (where about seventy structures exist and has been designated "one of the supports of Indian sanctuary engineering") and Badami. In spite of the fact that the accurate dating of these sanctuaries has been discussed, there is agreement that the beginnings of these developments are from c.ÃÂ 600. These are the Lad Khan Temple (dated by some to c.ÃÂ 450 yet more precisely to 620) with its intriguing punctured stone windows and models of stream goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which indicates advance in auxiliary structure; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (eighth century) and investigations to adjust a Buddhist "Chaitya" plan to a brahminical one (its expressive system is generally speaking a crossover of north and south Indian styles.); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with another consideration, a vestibule, interfacing the sanctum to the corridor. Other "dravida" style sanctuaries from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami. Situated outside the Chalukyan compositional heartland, 140ÃÂ km south-east of Badami, with a structure identified with the Early Chalukya style is the unordinary Parvati Temple at Sanduru which dates to the late seventh century. It is medium-sized, 48ÃÂ ft long and 37ÃÂ ft wide. It has a "nagara" (north Indian) style "vimana" (tower) and "dravida" (south Indian) style parts, has no mantapa (corridor) and comprises of an "antarala" (vestibule) delegated with a barrel-vaulted pinnacle ("sukhanasi"). The "stunned" base arrangement of the sanctuary wound up famous a lot later, in the eleventh century.
