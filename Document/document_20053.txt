In 1966, the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to today's MTO, published the Eastern Ontario Highway Planning Study, identifying the need for a controlled-access highway between Ottawa and HighwayÂ 401.
HighwayÂ 16, which passes over the geologically subdued St.Â Lawrence Lowlands, was selected over HighwayÂ 15, which crosses the undulating Canadian Shield to the west, as the ideal route for the new link.
HighwayÂ 16 was one of the first roads taken over by the expanding Department of Public Highways in 1918. The important corridor between the Trans-provincial Highway (HighwayÂ 2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the road was given a numerical designation to supplement the name.
This highway served the low traffic volumes of the day, but as the number of vehicles increased over the first half of the 20thÂ century, issues arose with the numerous private driveways along the route. To overcome this issue of abutting properties long-established on the old HighwayÂ 16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between HighwayÂ 401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original HighwayÂ 16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.
