"Too Much Too Soon" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album in "Rolling Stone", Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on "Chatterbox", calling it "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for "Creem" magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, especially in the case of Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren "should be ashamedâShadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." Robert Hilburn from the "Los Angeles Times" felt "Too Much Too Soon" was a better-produced album that proved the band to be "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since "Exile on Main St." by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In "The New Yorker", Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate "Too Much Too Soon" more than "New York Dolls" after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly "Human Being" and "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from "Phonograph Record" magazine said the group's "easy going ironic sensibility" was expressed "far more amusingly and accessibly" here than on their debut album.
