Following the attack on Gaba Tepe, Leane rejoined his unit in the principle guarded line around the foothold. Before day break on 19 May, components of the Ottoman sixteenth Division assaulted the third Brigade positions on Bolton's Ridge as a feature of a more extensive counterattack against the Anzac segment. Amid the battling, Leane was situated in a forward sap of the force channels disregarding a ravine where the Ottoman troops were congregating. From this position, Leane and two other eleventh Battalion men executed an expansive number of Ottoman troops with their rifles, shooting from first light until early afternoon. On 28 June, Leane's organization went ahead of Bolton's Ridge towards Turkey Knoll to give covering flame to a failed assault by the ninth Battalion on Ottoman channels on Sniper's Ridge. This assault was a bluff, proposed to occupy the Ottoman administrators from strengthening their troops inverse an Allied assault at Cape Helles far toward the south. The forward organization position was totally illogical, the lead components of Leane's organization were raked by shrapnel and assault rifle discharge, and Leane was injured in the face. Regardless of this, he stayed with his unit. The two organizations of the eleventh Battalion that were resolved to help the assault lost 21 murdered and 42 injured.
