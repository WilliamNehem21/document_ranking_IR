South Sister, otherwise called "Philanthropy", is the tallest fountain of the trio, remaining at . The eruptive items run from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a dominatingly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying a more established shield structure. Its cutting edge structure is close to 50,000ÃÂ years old, and it last ejected around 2,000 years back. Despite the fact that its first eruptive occasions from 50,000 to 30,000ÃÂ years back were overwhelmingly rhyolitic, somewhere in the range of 38,000 and 32,000ÃÂ years prior the spring of gushing lava started to switch back and forth between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic emissions. The well of lava fabricated an expansive andesitic cone, framing a precarious summit cone of andesite around 27,000 years prior. South Sister stayed torpid for a long time, after which its creation moved from dacitic to more rhyolitic magma. An eruptive scene around 2,200 years prior, named the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic powder from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, trailed by a thick rhyolite magma stream. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle comprised of dangerous fiery debris ejections pursued by thick rhyolitic magma streams. In contrast to the past eruptive period, it was brought about by the interruption of an embankment of new silicic magma that ejected from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a littler line on the north side. These ejections created pyroclastic streams and magma arches from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the fountain of liquid magma. These generally later, postglacial emissions recommend the nearness of a silicic magma store under South Sister, one that could maybe prompt future ejections.
