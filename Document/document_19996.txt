In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short and line-shaped, but longer than in other "manavi"-like species. The central groove in the nasal depression is relatively narrow. The frontal bones are rounded and bear a well-developed sagittal crest. Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is flat, as in "M.Â manavi" but unlike in "M.Â brachytragos", "M.Â griveaudi", and "M.Â mahafaliensis", which have a curved palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine. "Miniopterus aelleni" has 36Â teeth in the dental formula (two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in both upper toothrows and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in the lower toothrows). As is characteristic of "Miniopterus", the first upper premolar (P2; P1 and P3 are missing) is smaller and more simplified than the second (P4). There are clear diastemata (gaps) between the upper canine (C1) and P2 and between P2 and P4, which are weaker or absent in "M.Â griveaudi" and "M.Â manavi". Behind C1, the toothrows are about parallel, not divergent as in "M.Â manavi". The third upper molar (M3) is more compressed than in "M.Â manavi" and "M.Â griveaudi". In some measurements of the skull and teeth, Anjouan specimens are larger than those from Madagascar.
