Right away before Thomas' arrangement, York Minster, the house of prayer of the archdiocese, was harmed in a flame that cleared through York on 1069, and which additionally devastated the refectory and quarters for the groups. Not long after his sanctification, Thomas had another quarters and refectory assembled and another rooftop put on the church; these seem to have been impermanent measures be that as it may, as some time later, most likely in around 1075, he requested the development of another house of prayer on an alternate site. The new structure, a lot bigger than the one it supplanted, has not endure. It was unearthed somewhere in the range of 1966 and 1973, demonstrating the arrangement of the church building to be not quite the same as most others worked in England around that time. It was longer, had no passageways in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring tomb that had been long out of style in 1075. As a result of the manner in which the establishments were spread out, it seems likely that the whole structure was arranged and worked in one plan stage, with couple of adjustments. It might have been that Thomas structured his house of God to be as not normal for Canterbury Cathedral as could be expected under the circumstances, maybe as a result of the contention among York and Canterbury over supremacy. William of Malmesbury, a twelfth century author, expresses that Thomas completed the house of prayer, and this is confirmed by the way that Thomas was covered in the minster in 1100. A few components of Thomas' structure are as yet unmistakable in the grave of York Minster.
