From late 1939, 100 octane fuel ended up accessible from the U.S., West Indies, Persia, and, in littler amounts, locally, thus, "...ÃÂ in the main portion of 1940 the RAF exchanged all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel." Small changes were made to Merlin II and III arrangement motors, permitting an expanded (crisis) support weight of +12 pounds for every square inch (183ÃÂ kPa; 1.85ÃÂ atm). At this power setting these motors had the capacity to deliver 1,310 pull (977ÃÂ kW) at while running at 3,000 cycles for every moment. Expanded lift could be utilized inconclusively as there was no mechanical time limit component yet pilots were exhorted not to utilize expanded lift for in excess of a limit of five minutes and it was considered an "unmistakable over-burden condition on the motor"; if the pilot depended on crisis help he needed to report this on landing, when it was noted in the motor log book, while the designing officer was required to look at the motor and reset the throttle entryway. Later forms of the Merlin ran just on 100 octane fuel and the five-minute battle restriction was raised to +18 pounds for every square inch (224ÃÂ kPa; 2.3ÃÂ atm).
