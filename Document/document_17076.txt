A variety of synthetic routes to acid have been developed. The first reported chemical syntheses approached HMB by oxidation of alkene, vicinal diol, and alcohol precursors:
Depending on the experimental conditions, cycloaddition of acetone and ketene produces either or 4,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one, both of which hydrolyze under basic conditions to yield the conjugate base of HMB. The haloform reaction provides another pathway to HMB involving the exhaustive halogenation of the methyl-ketone region of diacetone alcohol with sodium hypobromite or sodium hypochlorite; Diacetone alcohol is readily available from the aldol condensation of acetone. An organometallic approach to HMB involves the carboxylation of "tert"-butyl alcohol with carbon monoxide and Fenton's reagent (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron). Alternatively, HMB can be prepared through microbial oxidation of acid by the fungus "Galactomyces reessii".
The concentration of naturally produced HMB has been measured in several human body fluids using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry, and gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry methods. In the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy adults, the average molar concentration of HMB has been measured at 4.0Â micromolar (Î¼M). The average concentration of HMB in the intramuscular fluid of healthy men of ages has been measured at 7.0Â Î¼M. In the urine of healthy individuals of any age, the excreted urinary concentration of HMB has been measured in a range of Â micromoles per millimole (Î¼mol/mmol) of creatinine. In the breast milk of healthy lactating women, HMB and have been measured in ranges of Â Î¼g/L and Â mg/L. In comparison, HMB has been detected and measured in the milk of healthy cows at a concentration of Â Î¼g/L. This concentration is far too low to be an adequate dietary source of HMB for obtaining pharmacologically active concentrations of the compound in blood plasma.
