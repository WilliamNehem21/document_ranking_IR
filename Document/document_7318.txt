The two destroyer minesweepers should clear the passage to Seeadler Harbor among Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands however shoot from no less than one Japanese weapon on Hauwei Island kept them from entering the harbor. Commander Emile Dechaineux, ordering the destroyers supporting the powers shorewards, brought "Ammen", "Bramble", "Mullany" and "Warramunga" around and assaulted the island. The Japanese weapons stopped discharge however woke up again when another endeavor was made to clear the channel. Dechaineux then canceled the exertion, requesting the DMSs to go along with him. The destroyers besieged Japanese weapons covering the passage to Hyane Harbor to enable the LSTs to leave untouched. One LST left with somewhere in the range of 20 and 30ÃÂ truckloads of stores still on board. The LSTs did not wish to stay after dim as a Japanese assault was normal. Dechaineux escorted them mostly until he got a request from Admiral Barbey for "Ammen", "Mullany", "Warramunga", and "Welles" to stay off Los Negros. "Ammen" and "Mullany" besieged Hauwei Island again in the first part of the day, setting off two or three ammo dumps, yet at the same time went under exact shoot from four or five firearms, and Dechaineux was compelled to educate Barbey that he was unfit to conquer the island's weapons.
