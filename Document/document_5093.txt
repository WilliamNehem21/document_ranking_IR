In 1970, scientist Richard A. Thulborn recommended that "Heterodontosaurus" was a lesser equivalent word of the sort "Lycorhinus", which was named in 1924 with the species "L. angustidens", additionally from an example found in South Africa. He renamed the sort species as an individual from the more seasoned variety, as the new blend "Lycorhinus tucki", which he thought about particular because of slight contrasts in its teeth and its stratigraphy. He repeated this case in 1974, in the portrayal of a third "Lycorhinus" animal varieties, "Lycorhinus consors", after analysis of the synonymy by Galton in 1973. In 1974, Charig and Crompton concurred that "Heterodontosaurus" and "Lycorhinus" had a place in a similar family, Heterodontosauridae, yet differ that they were comparative enough to be viewed as congeneric. They likewise brought up that the fragmentary nature and poor protection of the "Lycorhinus angustidens" holotype example made it difficult to completely come close it appropriately to "H. tucki". Notwithstanding the contention, neither one of the parties had analyzed the "L. angustidens" holotype direct, however in the wake of doing as such, scientist James A. Hopson additionally guarded conventional detachment of "Heterodontosaurus" in 1975, and moved "L. consors" to its very own class, "Abrictosaurus".
