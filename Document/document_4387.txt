Kruger introduced the arrangement to the volksraad for the triumvirate's sake at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. "With a sentiment of appreciation to the God of our dads", he stated, "who has been close us in fight and threat, it is to me an unspeakable benefit to lay before you the treatyÃÂ ... I think of it as my obligation clearly to proclaim before you and the entire world, that our regard for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the legislature of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been more prominent than as of now, when we are empowered to demonstrate to you a proof of England's respectable and charitable love for right and equity." This announcement was to be overlooked by numerous essayists, however Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as a standout amongst his "most striking articulations". Kruger reaffirmed his confidence in the imperial commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who met without precedent for Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as a guide. The officials held various sessions in Pretoria over the next months with little contribution from Kruger, who was out of commission with pneumonia.
