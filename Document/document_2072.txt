Epaminondas then gave the request to propel, finding the adversary napping, and causing an incensed scramble in the Mantinean camp to get ready for the fight to come. The fight unfurled as Epaminondas had arranged. The mounted force powers on the wings drove back the Athenian and Mantinean rangers inverse them. Diodorus says that the Athenian mounted force on the Mantinean conservative, despite the fact that not mediocre in quality, couldn't withstand the rockets from the light-troops that Epaminondas had put among the Theban rangers. Then, the Theban infantry progressed. Xenophon reminiscently portrays Epaminondas' reasoning: "[he] drove forward his military fore on, similar to a trireme, trusting that on the off chance that he could strike and slice through anyplace, he would annihilate the whole armed force of his foes." As at Leuctra, the debilitated conservative was requested to keep down and abstain from battling. In the conflict of infantry, the issue quickly remained in a precarious situation, yet then the Theban left-wing got through the Spartan line, and the whole adversary phalanx was put to flight. Be that as it may, at the stature of the fight, Epaminondas was mortally injured by a Spartan, and passed on presently. Following his demise, the Thebes and partners tried to seek after the escaping foe; a demonstration of Epaminondas' centrality to the war exertion.
