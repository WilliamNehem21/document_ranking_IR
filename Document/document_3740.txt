The Australian military kept on considering alternatives to gain overwhelming lift helicopters all through the 1960s, and a formal program to accomplish this objective was started by the RAAF in 1969. As of now the helicopters were expected to be sent to South Vietnam as a component of the Australian commitment to the Vietnam War. Another group of Air Force officers headed out to the United States, and assessed the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion and the Chinook. The group head, Group Captain Peter Raw, suggested that CH-53s be requested. Senior RAAF officers and the Army were not satisfied with this result, and the Air Board dismissed Raw's report. Peruse, who was presently an air bad habit marshal and vice president of the air staff, was coordinated to audit the selection of helicopters, and again suggested that Chinooks be obtained. He legitimized this decision in light of the fact that the Chinook could convey more load than the CH-53 and was more qualified for tasks in the mountains of the Australian-managed Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Peruse's suggestion was acknowledged by the Government, and a request for twelve CH-47C Chinooks was put in August 1970. It was wanted to pivot the helicopters all through administration, six being accessible whenever. The request was suspended later in 1970 when a progression of motor issues influenced the United States Army's CH-47Cs, however was reestablished in March 1972 after these issues were settled. The complete expense of the buy was $A37 million. The request made Australia the CH-47's first fare client.
