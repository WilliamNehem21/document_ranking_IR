Following the cancelation, an advisory group of London traders issued an open letter to Americans, cautioning them not to announce triumph. Bricklayer distributed a reaction in June 1766, parodying the British position, "We have, with interminable Difficulty and Fatigue got you pardoned this one Time; do what your Papa and Mamma offer, and hurry to restore your most appreciative Acknowledgments for stooping to give you a chance to keep what is your own." The Townshend Acts of 1767 were Britain's next endeavor to impose the states, setting obligations on substances including lead and glass, and inciting calls from the northern provinces for a blacklist of British merchandise. Virginia, increasingly reliant on products imported from Britain, was less excited, and, as nearby grower would in general get merchandise at their stream arrivals, a blacklist would be hard to implement. In April 1769, Washington sent a duplicate of a Philadelphia goals to Mason, asking his recommendation on what move Virginia should make. It is obscure who adjusted that content for use in Virginia (Broadwater finished up it was Mason) yet Mason sent Washington a rectified draft on April 23, 1769. Washington took it to Williamsburg, however the representative, Lord Botetourt, broke down the governing body on account of the extreme goals it was passing. The Burgesses deferred to a close-by bar, and there passed a non-importation understanding dependent on Mason's.
