By 1779, Haider Ali had caught portions of present day Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, stretching out the Kingdom's zone to about 80,000ÃÂ miÃÂ² (205,000ÃÂ kmÃÂ²). In 1780, he got to know the French and made harmony with the Marathas and the Nizam. Notwithstanding, Haider Ali was deceived by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made arrangements with the British also. In July 1779 Haider Ali headed a multitude of 80,000, for the most part rangers, plunging through the goes of the Ghats in the midst of consuming towns, before laying attack to British posts in northern Arcot beginning the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Haider Ali had some underlying victories against the British strikingly at Pollilur, the most exceedingly bad thrashing the British endured in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the entry of Sir Eyre Coote]], when the fortunes of the British started to change. On 1 June 1781 Coote] struck the primary overwhelming blow against Haider Ali in the definitive Battle of Porto Novo. The fight was won by Coote against chances of five to one, and is viewed as one of the best accomplishments of the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-battled fight at Pollilur (the scene of a prior triumph of Haider Ali over a British power) on 27 August, in which the British won another achievement, and by the defeat of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Haider Ali kicked the bucket on 7 December 1782, even as battling proceeded with the British. He was prevailing by his child Tipu Sultan who proceeded with threats against the British by recovering Baidanur and Mangalore.
