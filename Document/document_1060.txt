Kagame and the Rwandan government held solid impact over Kabila following his introduction, and the RPA kept up an overwhelming nearness in Kinshasa. Congolese in the capital disliked this, as did numerous in the eastern Kivu regions, where ethnic conflicts expanded strongly. In July 1998, Kabila terminated his Rwandan head of-staff, James Kabarebe, and requested all RPA troops to leave the nation. Kagame blamed Kabila for supporting the continuous insurrection against Rwanda from North Kivu, a similar allegation he had made about Mobutu. He reacted to the removal of his warriors by support another revolutionary gathering, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), and propelling the Second Congo War. The primary activity of the war was a quick assault by the RCD and RPA, driven by Kabarebe. These powers made brisk increases, progressing in twelve days from the Kivu areas west to inside of Kinshasa. The capital was spared by the intercession of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe on Kabila's side. Following the disappointment of the lightning war, the contention formed into a long haul regular war, which kept going until 2003 and caused a large number of passings and monstrous harm. As per a report by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), this contention prompted the loss of between 3 million and 7.6ÃÂ million lives, numerous through starvation and infection going with the social interruption of the war.
