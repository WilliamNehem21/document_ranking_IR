ÃÂthelbald was the second child of King ÃÂthelwulf and likely of his first spouse Osburh, who was the mother of Alfred the Great. As ÃÂthelstan was mature enough to be delegated ruler ten years before Alfred was conceived in 849, and ÃÂthelbald participated fighting in 851, a few students of history contend that all things considered, the senior kids were destined to an unrecorded before spouse. ÃÂthelstan kicked the bucket before his dad, however ÃÂthelbald and his three more youthful siblings were progressively lords of Wessex: ÃÂthelbald ruled from 855 to 860, ÃÂthelberht ruled from 860 to 865, ÃÂthelred I ruled from 865 to 871 and Alfred the Great ruled from 871 to 899. ÃÂthelbald is first recorded when he seen a contract of his dad (S 290) in 840 as "filius regis" (the lord's child). He bore witness to with a similar assignment during the 840s, to S 300 of every 850 as "dux filius regis" and in the mid 850s as "dux" (ealdorman). In 850 his senior sibling ÃÂthelstan crushed a Danish armada off Sandwich in the main recorded maritime fight in English history, yet he isn't recorded from there on, and most likely kicked the bucket soon a short time later. In 851 ÃÂthelwulf and ÃÂthelbald vanquished the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, as indicated by the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle", "we have never known about a more noteworthy butcher of them, in any district, on any one day, prior or since". At Easter in 854 ÃÂthelbald and his more youthful sibling ÃÂthelberht authenticated sanctions as "dux", and in 855 their dad went on journey to Rome and delegated ÃÂthelbald as lord of Wessex while ÃÂthelberht moved toward becoming ruler of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex.
