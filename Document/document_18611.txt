The standard definition of the number 0.999... is the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... A different definition involves what Terry Tao refers to as "ultralimit", i.e., the equivalence class [(0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...)] of this sequence in the ultrapower construction, which is a number that falls short of 1 by an infinitesimal amount. More generally, the hyperreal number with last digit 9 at infinite hypernatural rank "H", satisfies a strict inequality Accordingly, an alternative interpretation for "zero followed by infinitely many 9s" could be
All such interpretations of "0.999..." are infinitely close to 1. Ian Stewart characterizes this interpretation as an "entirely reasonable" way to rigorously justify the intuition that "there's a little bit missing" from 1 in 0.999... Along with Katz & Katz, Robert Ely also questions the assumption that students' ideas about are erroneous intuitions about the real numbers, interpreting them rather as "nonstandard" intuitions that could be valuable in the learning of calculus.
Jose Benardete in his book "Infinity: An essay in metaphysics" argues that some natural pre-mathematical intuitions cannot be expressed if one is limited to an overly restrictive number system:
Combinatorial game theory provides alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, motivated by the idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.010101...Â =Â . However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the surreal number , where Ï is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...
