The Mint follows the inceptions of the 50 State Quarters program to a congressional hearing in June 1995, at which Mint Director Philip N. Diehl, just as conspicuous numismatists, encouraged Congress to pass enactment permitting a progression of circling memorial coins like the quarters Canada had as of late struck for its territories. Accordingly, Congress passed the United States Commemorative Coins Act of 1996, which was marked by President Bill Clinton on October 20, 1996. The demonstration guided the Mint to ponder whether a progression of memorial quarters would be effective. The Mint appropriately considered the issue, and revealed positively. In spite of the fact that the demonstration had given Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin the specialist to complete the report by choosing new coin structures, Secretary Rubin liked to anticipate congressional activity. The subsequent 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act was marked by President Clinton on December 1, 1997. Under the demonstration, every one of the fifty states would be respected with another quarter, to be issued five a year starting in 1999, with the arrangement of issuance controlled by the request the states had entered the Union. The demonstration enabled the Secretary to decide the situation of the required legends, for example, "" on the coin: To oblige an expansive plan on the invert, "" and "" were moved to the front, and the bust of Washington contracted somewhat. A state's structure would be chosen by the Treasury Secretary on the proposal of the state's senator.
