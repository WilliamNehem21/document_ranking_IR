The adjacent Votty and Bowydd quarries shut in 1963. In 1969, the Dinorwig Quarry was shut, and more than 300 quarrymen lost their positions. The next year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the Braichgoch Slate Mine close Corris declared their conclusion. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog shut in 1971, yet was later revived by another organization. By 1972, the quantity of men utilized in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was minimal elective work in the slate-creating regions, and the terminations brought about high joblessness and a drop in populace as more youthful individuals moved away to look for some kind of employment. In 1979, after a long battle, the legislature perceived silicosis as a mechanical malady justifying remuneration. There was an expansion popular for slate during the 1980s, and in spite of the fact that this came past the point of no return for some quarries there was still some creation in the Blaenau Ffestiniog region at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, however the greater part of material slate generation was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further motorization was presented, with a mechanized laser pillar being utilized to help the sawing of the slate squares.
