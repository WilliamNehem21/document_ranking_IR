Smith was one of the most intense voices of white difference against the new constitution. He contradicted its part of the until now non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated "An" and "B" moves, saying the proposed framework had "racialist" undertones, and protested the possibility that the main dark MPs would be chosen on what he said would be a "degraded establishment". "Our arrangement in the past has dependably been that we would have an administration, in Rhodesia, in view of legitimacy and that individuals wouldn't stress whether you were dark or whether you were white," he said. He additionally called attention to that the report did not really ensure Southern Rhodesian freedom in case of Federal disintegration. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the main part out of 280 to cast a ballot against it. Profoundly disappointed by these advancements, he left the UFP not long after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an autonomous. He loaned his help to the "Joined Group", an unbalanced alliance wherein Winston Field's preservationist Dominion Party moved in with Sir Robert Tredgold and different dissidents against the sacred recommendations, notwithstanding restricting them for absolutely opposing reasons. The dark patriot pioneers at first embraced the constitution, marking the draft report, yet very quickly denied it and called for blacks to blacklist races held under it. A submission of the for the most part white electorate affirmed the new constitution by a lion's share of 65% on 26 July 1961.
