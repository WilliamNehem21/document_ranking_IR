In 1834, the majority of the Gloucestershire yeomanry chiefs met in the village of Petty France in south Gloucestershire and consented to consolidate their troops into a solitary regiment, to be named the Gloucestershire Yeomanry Cavalry. Its initially leader was the Marquis of Worcester, who turned into the seventh Duke of Beaufort in 1835, hence starting the regiment's long relationship with the Beaufort family. The new regiment was positioned 24th in the yeomanry request of priority and involved seven troops with a complete quality of 26 officers and 382 different positions. Embracing the uniform of light dragoons, each man was outfitted with sword and gun, and twelve skirmishers in each troop were furnished with gag stacking carbines. The regiment's first sending came in 1838, when the Dodington and Winterbourne Troops helped police a Chartist rally in Bristol. The 'Imperial' prefix was conceded in 1841, and in 1847 the regiment embraced a blue hussar uniform and the name Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. The expert of the Duke of Beaufort is clear in his request, in 1846, that all individuals ought to develop mustaches "as a cutting blade", a guidance that was criticized in the pages of Punch magazine at the time, and his request the following year that the regiment wear the second coat over the back, Hungarian style, rather than the standard English-style over the shoulder.
