Indonesia is in unrest. The people lives in destitution, while the rich parade their riches. President Sukarno (Umar Kayam) is sick and may kick the bucket. In the interim, his political idea of Nasakom (patriotism, religion, and socialism) has advanced a touchy development in the PKI. The gathering, which organized an overthrow in 1948, has been assaulting and slaughtering individuals all through the nation. The debilitated president is additionally being controlled by the gathering. The PKI has fabricated a story, in light of the fashioned Gilchrist Document, that a Generals' Council is planning for an upset should Sukarno pass on. Aidit (Syubah Asa), Syam, and the Communist Party initiative furtively plan to blame this for their own overthrow. The majority individuals from the Party acknowledge the initiative's clarification and, with the assistance of "ground breaking" troopers and officers (for the most part from the Air Force), work to assemble the Party's powers. They intend to capture seven commanders (said to be individuals from the Generals' Council), overwhelm the city, and secure Sukarno. The recently named G30S starts preparing. The rightist individuals from the Army are uninformed of this up and coming overthrow, living cheerfully with their families. When they understand that something is out of order, it is past the point of no return.
