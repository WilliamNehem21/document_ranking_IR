A Mughal territory, which included the Carnatic locale south of the Tungabhadra waterway, and which was to exist for a long time, was built up in 1687 with its capital at Sira (in Tumkur District). (See .) Known as the "Territory of Sira" (likewise "Carnatic-Balaghat"), it was made out of seven parganas (locale): Basavapatna, Budihal, Sira, Penukonda, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, and Kolar; what's more, Harpanahalli, Kondarpi, Anegundi, Bednur, Chitaldroog, and Mysore were considered by the Mughals to be tributary conditions of the area. Qasim Khan (additionally, Khasim Khan or Kasim Khan) was designated the first "Subahdar" (senator) and "Faujdar" (military representative) of the area in 1689. Having shown "vitality and achievement" both in controlling and in building up the area, he passed on in 1694, either murdered by Maratha marauders from the northwest, or executing himself in disfavor after these looters caught a fortune under his consideration. Most "Subhahdars" who represented after him were to be supplanted in a year or two by a successor. The flimsiness would proceed until Dilavar Khan was delegated senator in 1726, his term enduring until 1756. In 1757, Sira was overwhelm by the Marathas, just to be reestablished to the Mughals in 1759. In 1761 future ruler Haidar Ali, whose possess father had been the Mughal military senator (or "Faujdar") of Kolar area in the region, caught Sira, and before long presented on himself the title of "Nawab of Sira". In any case, the abandonment of his sibling five years after the fact made the region be lost again to the Marathas, who held it until Haidar's child, Tipu Sultan, recovered it for his dad in 1774.
