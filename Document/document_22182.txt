Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of "Edge" praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it "offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames". "Eurogamer"s Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as "sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a clichÃ©". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a "damsel in distress", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated "based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games". Chris Suellentrop of "The New York Times" acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and "sometimes powerful" character, but argued that "The Last of Us" is "actually the story of Joel", stating that it's "another video game by men, for men and about men". "The Last of Us" was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality "added to his character ... without really tokenizing him". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the "most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013", calling him "deeply flawed but wholly unique". A kiss between two female characters in "Left Behind" was met with positive reactions.
