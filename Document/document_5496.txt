While her controlling was being fixed in Malta, the "Renowned" was shelled again on 16 January by 17 Junkers Ju 88 medium planes and 44 Stukas. The pilots of 806 Squadron professed to have shot down two of the previous and conceivably harmed another pair, yet a 500ÃÂ kg bomb entered her flight deck toward the back of the back lift and exploded in the chief's day lodge; a few different bombs almost hit the ship yet just caused minor harm. After two days, one of three Fulmars that captured an Axis air attack on the Maltese runways was shot down without any survivors. Just a single Fulmar was useful on 19 January, when the bearer was assaulted a few times and it was shot down. "Famous" was not struck amid these assaults but rather was close missed a few times and the subsequent stun waves from their explosions ousted enough frame plating to cause a prompt 5-degree list, broke the cast-iron establishments of her port turbine, and harmed other hardware. The maritime student of history J. D. Dark colored noticed that "There is no uncertainty that the defensively covered deck spared her from devastation; no other bearer took anything like this dimension of discipline and endure."
