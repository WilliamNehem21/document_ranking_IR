Saadiq called "The Way I See It" "an amazing zenith of encounters educated by the music I experienced childhood with." Kristal Hawkins of "The Village Voice" said that he "hit his aesthetic development" with the collection. Robert Christgau commented on its place in his performance profession, "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! TonÃÂ©! collection into a virtuoso history exercise. After six years, he attempted to astonish Maxwell in his own reflected brilliance. After six years once more, he outd[id] himself with a valiant come back to retro." Elton John, a devotee of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! TonÃÂ©!, said that he was "overwhelmed" by "The Way I See It", refering to it as "my collection of the year Ã¢ÂÂ a spirit record of the most noteworthy quality." He in this way called Saadiq to compliment him for the collection and request that he play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In a meeting for "Blues and Soul", Saadiq explained on the collection's effect on his profession: "before that record Ã¢ÂÂ after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! what's more, Lucy Pearl Ã¢ÂÂ a great many people had thought 'Gracious well, he's a maker now. He's never going to be a craftsman, he's not going to put the time in' ... "The Way I See It" demonstrated to them that indeed, I could put the time in still and be a craftsman!"
