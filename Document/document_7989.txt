The goddesses find and reestablish Osiris' body, frequently with the assistance of different gods, including Thoth, a divinity credited with incredible otherworldly and mending forces, and Anubis, the lord of treating and funerary ceremonies. Osiris turns into the main mummy, and the divine beings' endeavors to reestablish his body are the legendary reason for Egyptian preserving rehearses, which tried to forestall and invert the rot that pursues passing. This piece of the story is regularly reached out with scenes in which Set or his devotees attempt to harm the carcass, and Isis and her partners must secure it. When Osiris is made entire, Isis imagines his child and legitimate beneficiary, Horus. One equivocal spell in the Coffin Texts may show that Isis is impregnated by a glimmer of lightning, while in different sources, Isis, still in fledgling structure, fans breath and life into Osiris' body with her wings and has sexual relations with him. Osiris' recovery is clearly not perpetual, and after this point in the story he is just referenced as the leader of the Duat, the far off and secretive domain of the dead. In spite of the fact that he lives on just in the Duat, he and the sovereignty he represents will, as it were, be renewed in his child.
