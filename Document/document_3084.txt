Martill and his group initially characterized "Irritator" as a maniraptoran dinosaur in the clade Bullatosauria (a gathering never again considered monophyletic), as a nearby in respect to the feathered ornithomimosaurs and troodontids. Given that its dental morphology, especially long nose, and expected balance molded peak were highlights obscure in "other" maniraptorans, the specialists raised the new family Irritatoridae inside the clade. They perceived "Irritator"s affinities with "Spinosaurus", in that they both had comparatively formed and unserrated teeth, however noticed that the last's mandible would not accommodate with the front of "Irritator"s upper jaw, and that other non-avian dinosaurs like "Compsognathus" and "Ornitholestes" additionally bore no serrations on a few or the majority of their teeth. A portion of these cases were addressed in 1996 by Kellner who found that "Irritator"s skull came up short on the one autapomorphy (recognizing highlight) analyzed in maniraptorans at the time, which was having its (cheek) bone shaping piece of the antorbital fenestra. He additionally called attention to that since "Irritator challengeri"s holotype came up short on the tip of its nose, it would not be conceivable to know whether "Spinosaurus"s dentary could supplement it or not. In view of examinations with "Spinosaurus", Kellner settled "Irritator" as a spinosaurid and synonymized Irritatoridae with that family. "Irritator" was then allocated to the Baryonychidae alongside "Angaturama", "Baryonyx", "Suchomimus," and "Spinosaurus" by Oliver W. M. Rauhut in 2003. Thomas Holtz and associates in 2004 considered the Baryonychidae synonymous with Spinosauridae, and moved these genera to the last family. Most later updates have maintained these groupings. As spinosaurids, "Irritator" and "Angaturama" are set inside the superfamily Megalosauroidea, with Spinosauridae being a conceivable sister taxon to the Megalosauridae.
