"Banksia marginata" is a highly variable species, usually ranging from a small shrub around a metre (3Â ft) tall to a tree. Unusually large trees of 15 to possibly 30Â m (50â100Â ft) have been reported near Beeac in Victoria's Western District as well as several locations in Tasmania, while compact shrubs limited to high have been recorded on coastal heathland in Tasmania (such as at Rocky Cape National Park). Shrubs reach only high in Gibraltar Range National Park. The bark is pale grey and initially smooth before becoming finely tessellated with age. The new branchlets are hairy at first but lose their hairs as they mature, the new growth a pale or pinkish brown. The leaves are alternately arranged on the stems on 2â5Â mm long petioles, and characteristically toothed in juvenile or younger leaves ( long). The narrow adult leaves are dull green in colour and generally linear, oblong or wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure long and wide. The margins become entire with age, and the tip is most commonly truncate or emarginate, but can be acute or mucronate. The cellular makeup of the leaves shows evidence of lignification, and the leaves themselves are somewhat stiff. Leaves also have sunken stomates. The leaf undersurface is white with a prominent midrib covered in brownish hairs.
