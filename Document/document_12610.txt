"Suwo" was re-assigned as a top notch seaside protection send on 28 August 1912 and turned into a preparation dispatch for cadets and designers. At first relegated to the first Standing Squadron when World War I started, she in a matter of seconds a short time later turned into the leader of the second Squadron, instructed by Vice Admiral Kato Sadakichi. The squadron was entrusted to barricade the German-possessed port of Tsingtao, China, and to coordinate with the Imperial Japanese Army in catching the city. "Tango" and different boats of the squadron, strengthened by the British pre-battleship , besieged German strongholds all through the attack until the Germans surrendered on 7 November. "Suwo" filled in as leader of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915Ã¢ÂÂ 1916 preceding turning into a gunnery preparing ship at Yokosuka for the remainder of the war. In April 1922, in consistence with the Washington Naval Treaty, "Suwo" was incapacitated at the Kure Naval Arsenal. While her protection was being evacuated, the ship overturned on 13 July. She was most likely rejected in 1922Ã¢ÂÂ 1923, however something like one source recommends she was refloated and hulked, serving until being separated at Kure in 1946.
