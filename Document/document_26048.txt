Modeled after the "Puss Gets the Boot" characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because "we knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought." The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's "The Midnight Snack". Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on "Tom and Jerry", directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films. "Tom and Jerry" relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, "Tom and Jerry" has often been criticized as excessively violent. Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, "The Yankee Doodle Mouse" (1943)âa war-time adventure. "Tom and Jerry" was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM's live-action films, including "Anchors Aweigh" (1945) and "Invitation to the Dance" (1956) with Gene Kelly, and "Dangerous When Wet" (1953) with Esther Williams.
