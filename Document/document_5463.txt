Virginia's lay and religious pioneers were progressively keen on indicting offenses, for example, tattle, defamation, and sex, considering them to be dangers to social steadiness. They wished to maintain a strategic distance from black magic indictments, which were disruptive. Virginia courts were hesitant to hear allegations of black magic and were significantly progressively hesitant to convict. Not at all like the Salem witch preliminary courts, where the denounced needed to demonstrate her honesty, in Virginia courts the informer worried about the concern of confirmation. Further, Virginia courts commonly overlooked proof said to have been acquired by extraordinary methods, though the New England courts were known to convict individuals dependent on it. Virginia required verification of blame through either scans for witch's imprints or dodging. Judges and officers would expel unverified instances of black magic and permit the informers, who got themselves "under an evil tongue", to be sued for criticism. Frances Pollard of the Virginia Historical Society states: "It was quite evident that Virginia from the get-go endeavored to dishearten these charges being brought of black magic since they were so troublesome." The southeastern corner of Virginia, around present-day Norfolk and Virginia Beach (where Pungo is found), saw a larger number of allegations of black magic than different territories. As indicated by Leslie M. Newman, this may have been because of nearby neediness as there was no social first class to limit such arraignments.
