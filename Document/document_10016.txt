The Australian raven can be found in a wide scope of characteristic and altered natural surroundings. It requires accessible water and trees (or structures) to perch in or roost on. Favored living spaces incorporate eucalypt-ruled sclerophyll timberland, and farmland adjoining trees. It is likewise found in heath and mangroves. In regions where it happens with the little raven, to be specific over quite a bit of focal New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is limited to increasingly forested regions while the last species lean towards progressively open regions. So also, in inland Australia it can impart a range to the little crow, as the two don't seem to contend. Be that as it may, the scopes of comparable estimated backwoods raven and Torresian crow just barely cover with the Australian raven as every one of the three rival one another. In focal and western districts, Australian ravens and Torresian crows compete for the dispersed phenomenal trees and outcrops, and just either are found there. It co-happens with the woodland raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adjusted to human home in certain urban areas and is the most well-known corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is supplanted by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its extensive territory, plenitude and expanding populace mean it is delegated "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List.
