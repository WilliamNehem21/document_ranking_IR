The circumstance looked set to improve in spring when the new Caliph, Umar II (), sent two armadas to the besiegers' guide: 400 boats from Egypt under an authority named Sufyan and 360 boats from Africa under Izid, all loaded down with provisions and arms. In the meantime, a new armed force started walking through Asia Minor to aid the attack. At the point when the new armadas touched base in the Sea of Marmara, they stayed away from the Byzantines and tied down on the Asian shore, the Egyptians in the Gulf of Nicomedia close present day Tuzla and the Africans south of Chalcedon (at Satyros, Bryas and Kartalimen). The vast majority of the Arab armadas' groups were made out of Christian Egyptians, be that as it may, and they started abandoning to the Byzantines upon their landing. Informed by the Egyptians of the approach and attitude of the Arab fortifications, Leo propelled his armada in an assault against the new Arab armadas. Injured by the absconding of their teams, and powerless against Greek discharge, the Arab ships were annihilated or caught alongside the weapons and supplies they conveyed. Constantinople was currently sheltered from a seaborne assault. Ashore too the Byzantines were successful: their troops figured out how to snare the propelling Arab armed force under an officer named Mardasan and devastate it in the slopes around Sophon, south of Nicomedia.
