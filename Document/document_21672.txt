A 2006 review asserted: "Many are the knowledgeable and discriminating people for whom Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific", brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." In 1987, however, John Rockwell of "The New York Times" reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while "South Pacific" had been innovative for 1949, "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, "South Pacific" epitomized the concerns of the dayÂ â America's responsibilities in the world and the dangers of racism.Â ... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with "M*A*S*H" having contemporized this same setting". A 2008 "Huffington Post" review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on "exotic background roles" in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." "South Pacific" is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, "Helmet for My Pillow", after he walked out of a performance: "I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn't a musical."
