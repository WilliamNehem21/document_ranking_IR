Susianna Kentikian was conceived in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the girl of veterinary specialist Levon Kentikian and his better half Makruhi. At five years old, she left Armenia with her folks and her nine-year-old sibling, Mikael, on the grounds that her dad was called up to serve in the military amid the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family initially moved to Berlin, Germany and remained at refuge searchers' homes. Be that as it may, because of the viciousness at these offices and their poor learning of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to class for a brief timeframe. The family came back to Germany in 1996 and migrated in Hamburg, again living in government offices for haven searchers. Kentikian's living arrangement status stayed questionable for right around 10 years. A few times, she and her family were taken to the airplane terminal for extradition, yet the mediation of nearby companions, for example, her novice mentor, Frank Rieth, who called legal counselors, the media and neighborhood government officials, kept their last ejection. Her family got a changeless home license in 2005 when she marked a three-year proficient boxing contract that set up a steady pay.
