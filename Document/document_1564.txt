The "Chesapeake"Ã¢ÂÂ "Panther" Affair, and later the "Little Belt" Affair, added to the United States' choice to pronounce war on Britain on 18ÃÂ June 1812. "Chesapeake", under the order of Captain Samuel Evans, was set up for obligation in the Atlantic. Starting on 13ÃÂ December, she ran from Madeira and made a trip clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and after that back to Boston. She caught six ships as prizes: the British boats "Volunteer", "LiverpoolÃÂ Hero", "Baron Percy", and "Ellen"; the brig "Julia", an American ship exchanging under a British permit; and "Valeria", an American ship recovered from British privateers. Amid the voyage she was pursued by an obscure British ship-of-the-line and frigate be that as it may, after a passing tempest squall, the two seeking after boats were gone the following morning. The payload of "Volunteer", 40ÃÂ tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. "Baron Percy" never made it back to port as she steered into the rocks off the bank of Long Island, and "LiverpoolÃÂ Hero" was singed as she was viewed as flawed. "Chesapeake"s all out money related harm to British delivery was $235,675. She came back to Boston on 9ÃÂ April 1813 for refitting.
