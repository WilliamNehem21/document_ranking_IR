Welensky, who had contradicted UDI, expressed that he felt it was in any case "the obligation of each capable Rhodesian to help the progressive government" as he trusted the main option was a plummet into rebellion. JoÃÂ£o de Freitas Cruz, the Portuguese diplomat general in Salisbury, responded to the news with wild energy; visiting the Smith habitation later in the day, he proclaimed "No one but Rhodesians could do this!" An announcement from ZAPU's Jason Moyo, who was in London at the time, reproved UDI as a demonstration of "treachery and insubordination" and affirmed that "the lives especially of four million unarmed Africans are in peril". Davis M'Gabe of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) said that "For each one of the individuals who value opportunity and an important life, UDI has set a crash course which can't be adjusted. [It has] denoted the defining moment of the battle for freedomÃÂ ... from a sacred and political one to fundamentally a military battle." Most significant Christian denominational pioneers in the nation openly dismissed UDI and the declaration that it guarded Christianity, except for the neighborhood Dutch Reformed Church, which expressed that it was unopinionated and from that point ceased from remark.
