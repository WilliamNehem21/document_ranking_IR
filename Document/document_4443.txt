In "Little girl of Shanghai", Wong played the Asian-American female lead in a job that was reworked for her as the courageous woman of the story, effectively setting the plot into movement as opposed to the more aloof character initially arranged. The content was so deliberately custom-made for Wong that at one point it was given the working title "Anna May Wong Story". Of this film, Wong told "Hollywood Magazine", "I like my part in this image superior to anything any I've had beforeÃÂ ... since this image gives Chinese a breakÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ we have thoughtful parts for a change! To me that implies a lot." "The New York Times" gave the film a for the most part positive audit, remarking of its B-motion picture causes, "A bizarrely skilled cast spares the film from the most noticeably bad results of certain inescapable clichÃÂ©s. [The cast]ÃÂ ... consolidate with successful sets to lessen the common chances against any photos in the "Little girl of Shanghai" convention." In October 1937, the press conveyed bits of gossip that Wong had plans to wed her male co-star in this film, cherished companion and Korean-American performing artist Philip Ahn. Wong answered, "It would resemble wedding my sibling."
