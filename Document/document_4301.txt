On Monday 4 February, William got some rope at the neighborhood food merchant's shop, and spent the remainder of the day watching cases at the Sheriff Court from the open exhibition. He was later answered to have listened mindfully to the procedures. On 7 February, he went to the court sessions once more. On 10 February, he visited his colleague, Walker, who loaned him a paper that included a lady's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look into any updates on Jack the Ripper, at which Bury tossed down the paper with a fear. That night, he strolled into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and detailed his better half's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking vigorously the night prior to her demise, and he had woken in the first part of the day to discover his significant other's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Cover had not gathered a specialist, however had rather cut the body and disguised it in one of the pressing cases brought from London. Cover disclosed to Parr that his activities were presently going after his psyche, and he was worried about the possibility that that he would be captured and blamed for being Jack the Ripper.
