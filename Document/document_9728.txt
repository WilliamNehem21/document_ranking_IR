On November 15, 1974, the Mint started taking requests for the silver clad pieces, at a cost of $15 for evidence sets and $9 for uncirculated, with a due date for requests of January 31, 1975. Uncirculated coins resemble those recently discharged into dissemination; evidence coins have a mirror wrap up. Purchasers were at first restricted to five sets for each individual. On January 19, 1975, Brooks declared that the silver evidence set cost was sliced to $12, and as far as possible was postponed. Purchasers who had paid the more expensive rate were sent discounts with a money order. Creeks expressed that the value decrease was a direct result of generation efficiencies, the advantage of which she wished to go along to people in general. Numismatic feature writer Ed Reiter noted, however, that the decrease came in the midst of challenges from the numismatic network that the cost was excessively high. Coin vendor Herby Skelton recommended in 1977 that the underlying high cost for the sets pursued by the decrease, together with the extensive mintage of silver sets made the open suspicious and added to slacking deals. On August 20, 1975, the cost for the uncirculated silver sets was diminished to $7 when mass buys of at least 50 were made. A bank in Taiwan requested 250,000ÃÂ sets at this cost.
