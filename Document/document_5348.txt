Poulenc formed tunes all through his profession, and his yield in the class is broad. In Johnson's view, the greater part of the best were written during the 1940s. In spite of the fact that generally fluctuated in character, the melodies are overwhelmed by Poulenc's inclination for specific writers. From the start of his vocation he supported refrains by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the essayist whose work he set regularly was Paul ÃÂluard. Different artists whose works he as often as possible set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and Louise de Vilmorin. In the perspective on the music faultfinder Andrew Clements, the ÃÂluard tunes incorporate a large number of Poulenc's most noteworthy settings; Johnson calls the cycle "Tel Jour, Telle Nuit" (1937) the writer's "watershed work", and Nichols sees it as "a magnum opus qualified to remain adjacent to FaurÃÂ©'s "La bonne chanson"". Clements finds in the ÃÂluard settings a significance "universes from the weak, witty surfaces of Poulenc's initial symphonic and instrumental music". The first of the "Deux poÃÂ¨mes de Louis Aragon" (1943), titled essentially "C", is depicted by Johnson as "a gem known the world over; it is the most irregular, and maybe the most moving, tune about the desolates of war at any point formed."
