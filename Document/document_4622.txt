In 1990, a huge, obscure wreck was experienced by the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV "Moana Wave 1" while reviewing the way of the PacRimWest correspondences link. One of the study ship's group guessed that the disaster area, situated at in of water, was "Australia", however Fugro remained quiet about the data until 2002, when the organization's Australian branch referenced the revelation amid a meeting. This provoked the enthusiasm of an individual from the New South Wales Heritage Office, who mentioned duplicates of the organization's information. The size and area of the ship pointed towards it being "Australia", however the profundity implied confirmation through investigation must be accomplished with a remote worked vehicle (ROV). The RAN was drawn closer in 2007 for help, however in spite of the fact that they bolstered the task, the RAN did not have the gear to help. In March 2007, the United States Navy lent the remote ocean ROV "CURV-21" to the Australian Government, to find and recoup a Black Hawk helicopter which slammed amid the Australian reaction to the 2006 Fijian overthrow. While on the way back to Australia, the ROV, conveyed on board Defense Maritime Services vessel , was coordinated to Fugro's directions in line with the NSW Heritage Office to check and assess the disaster area. Video film caught by the ROV permitted the NSW Heritage Office to affirm that the disaster area was "Australia" by coordinating highlights like the superstructure and poles to verifiable photos. Albeit at first sinking stern-first, the battlecruiser leveled out as she sank, with the toward the back pole the first to strike the base. In the wake of hitting the seabed, "Australia" slid going to her last resting spot. The disaster area site is secured under the government "Notable Shipwrecks Act 1976".
