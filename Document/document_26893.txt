Likely unaware of a recent armistice between Russia and the Porte, Rizo's squadron appeared off the town's coast on June18 after it was reunited with its Tyre and Acre detachments. The force consisted of two frigates, the "Sv. Nikolai" and the "Sv. Pavel", four polaccas, five half-galleys and four xebecs. It was transporting an infantry division that was largely made up of Greek and Albanian mercenaries. Bombardment of the town began on the same day, and Ottoman ships docked in its port were sunk. In his version of the events, Auriant, author of "Catherine II et l'Orient", wrote that Beirut's defenders were given a 24-hour ultimatum by Rizo to fly the Russian flag and pay a tribute. The naval offensive lasted five days and involved an unsuccessful assault by a landing party on June21. After two days of heavier bombardment, they finally landed on June23 and spent hours sacking the town and its bazaar. About 550,000 qirsh worth of loot, in the form of both trade goods and cash, was taken. The Russians left on June28, after receiving additional payment from Yusuf Shihab, a Druze emir who ruled over the surrounding mountains. Shihab also agreed to a four-month alliance with the coalition.
