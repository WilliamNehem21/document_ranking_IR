Lang trusted that, as Prince of Wales, Edward had not generally been astute in his selection of companions and colleagues, whose benchmarks Lang was later to censure as "strange to all the best senses and customs of his kin". The ecclesiastical overseer had known for quite a while of the King's association with the American Wallis Simpson, at that point wedded to her second spouse Ernest Simpson. In mid-1936 it turned out to be evident that the King planned to wed Simpson either previously or soon after his looming crowning liturgy, contingent upon the planning of her separation from her better half. Lang obsessed about whether he could, with great heart, control the Coronation Oath to the lord in such conditions, remembering the Church's instructing on marriage. He trusted to his journal his expectations that conditions may change, or that he may probably induce the King to rethink his activities, however the King would not meet him. Lang kept close contact with the King's mom, Queen Mary, the Prime Minister and the King's Private Secretary. The lord trusted that Lang's impact was solid, later reviewing how from start to finish he felt the ecclesiastical overseer's "shadowy, floating nearness" out of sight.
