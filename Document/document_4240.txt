The primary convention relates that Thomas filled in as a "spatharios" (staff officer) to Bardanes Tourkos, the "monostrategos" ("single-general", for example president) of the eastern subjects, who in 803 rose in disobedience to Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802Ã¢ÂÂ 811). Close by Thomas were two other youthful "spatharioi" in Bardanes' entourage, who framed an intimate affiliation: Leo the Armenian, the future Leo V, and Michael the Amorian, the future Michael II. As indicated by a later hagiographic custom, before propelling his revolt, Bardanes, in the organization of his three youthful protÃÂ©gÃÂ©s, is said to have visited a priest close Philomelion who was rumored to anticipate what's to come. The priest anticipated what might in fact occur: that Bardanes' revolt would fizzle, that Leo and Michael would both become heads, and that Thomas would be acclaimed sovereign and slaughtered. At the point when Bardanes did in truth ascend, he neglected to win any broad help. Leo and Michael before long relinquished him and surrendered to the majestic camp and were remunerated with senior military posts. Thomas alone stayed faithful to Bardanes until his surrender. In the repercussions of Bardanes' disappointment, Thomas vanishes from the hotspots for a long time. Cover recommends that he fled (for a second time as indicated by his translation) to the Arabs, a view acknowledged by various different researchers, for example, Romilly James Heald Jenkins. The student of history Warren Treadgold, in any case, contends that Thomas remained in the domain and that may have even stayed in dynamic military administration, and clarifies his lack of definition by Thomas' relationship with Bardanes, which hampered his profession.
