At the point when Strepsirrhini is isolated into two infraorders, the clade containing all toothcombed primates can be classified "lemuriforms". When it is separated into three infraorders, the expression "lemuriforms" alludes just to Madagascar's lemurs, and the toothcombed primates are alluded to as either "crown strepsirrhines" or "surviving strepsirrhines". Perplexity of this particular wording with the general term "strepsirrhine", alongside distorted anatomical examinations and dubious phylogenetic inductions, can prompt confusions about primate phylogeny and errors about primates from the Eocene, as observed with the media inclusion of "Darwinius". Since the skeletons of adapiforms share solid similitudes with those of lemurs and lorises, scientists have regularly alluded to them as "crude" strepsirrhines, lemur precursors, or a sister gathering to the living strepsirrhines. They are incorporated into Strepsirrhini, and are viewed as basal individuals from the clade. In spite of the fact that their status as evident primates isn't addressed, the faulty connection among adapiforms and other living and fossil primates prompts different characterizations inside Strepsirrhini. Regularly, adapiforms are set in their very own infraorder because of anatomical contrasts with lemuriforms and their vague relationship. At the point when imparted characteristics to lemuriforms (which could conceivably be synapomorphic) are underscored, they are once in a while decreased to families inside the infraorder Lemuriformes (or superfamily Lemuroidea).
