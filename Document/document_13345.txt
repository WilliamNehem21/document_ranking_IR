In April 1942, Jeffrey was delegated to build up and order No. 2 Operational Training Unit (No.ÃÂ 2 OTU). At first based at Port Pirie, South Australia, the unit migrated to Mildura, Victoria, the next month, preparing pilots for battle in such air ship as Kittyhawks, CAC Boomerangs and Supermarine Spitfires. Its educators under Jeffrey included pros Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Jeffrey wedded Colleen Crozier at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 14ÃÂ May; his best man was individual expert and No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron veteran Alan Rawlinson. The couple had two children. In August 1943, Jeffrey assumed responsibility for No.ÃÂ 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters, situated in Darwin, Northern Territory. On 25ÃÂ September, he took over from Caldwell as Officer Commanding No.ÃÂ 1 (Fighter) Wing, involving three Spitfire squadrons whose job was to shield North-Western Area (NWA) from air assault. At this point, Japanese attacks had declined in quality and recurrence, and Allied powers in the NWA moved from a guarded stance to ambushing Japanese positions in the Dutch East Indies and Western New Guinea. No.ÃÂ 1 Wing blocked a few pillagers in late September yet none came in October; the keep going Japanese assault on northern Australia occurred on 12ÃÂ November. Jeffrey was elevated to brief gathering commander in December.
