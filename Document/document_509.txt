Right off the bat in the season, as the Ohio Works group arranged for a second diversion with the Zanesville Moguls (close opponents in the 1905 title amusements), the club supervisor, Hogan, talked unhesitatingly on their odds of catching the alliance flag. "In the event that the young men experience the season as they are playing now, we will experience no difficulty winning out", he said to a correspondent with "The Youngstown Daily Vindicator". "Our pitchers are in great condition and are holding the restricting batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has spared numerous an amusement for us. We have no .350 hitters on the club, however any man on it is at risk to venture in and separate a diversion". A nearby paper affirmed Hogan's evaluation of the group, seeing that just a single player, outfielder Will Thomas, had stirred up a batting normal of .306. By and by, as Hogan anticipated, the group crushed the Moguls, with a last score of 11Ã¢ÂÂ 8. The amusement's features incorporated the pitching of "Long John" Kennedy, who held the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who "loosened a drive to center field that allowed him to go right around".
