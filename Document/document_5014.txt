Priore reflected: "Really, the [only] reason a great many people couldn't have cared less for "Smiley Smile" is that it turned out instead of "Grin"." Richie Unterberger agreed, rating the collection four out of five stars, and proposing that media-publicity of the crumbled "Grin" venture was to be faulted for "Smiley Smile"s dull gathering in the United States. He considered it a "somewhat clever, if rather slight, exertion that is bounty abnormal". In a 2007 issue of "Moving Stone", Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 fundamental collections of 1967; Christgau announced: "Transcending it's not; some sort of hit it is." In 2001, Spencer Owen of "Pitchfork" granted the collection a 9.5/10 score, and composed ""Smiley Smile" is a close perfect work of art. With no attention to "Grin's" presence, this collection could have been a contemporary classicÃÂ ... also, in spite of the fact that the collection isn't anyplace near the sonic transformation that "Sgt. Pepper" had just brought, Wilson's inventive generation courses of action as yet draw out the best in each and every track." Daniel Harrison contrasted Wilson with traditional authors, for example, Schoenberg, with a key distinction being that Wilson "required the administrations of a record organization to mass produce and disperse his work", and regretted that the collection was contradictory with the business requests of the music business. Bruce Johnston called the collection "a thousand times superior to the [original "Smile"] ... It's simply the most misjudged collection in the entire inventory for me."
