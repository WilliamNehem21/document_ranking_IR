The character of Earl Jenkins (Tony Todd), planned to be a thoughtful scalawag, appeared to be "totally unlikable" in the first draft of "Nerves". The character experiences over-introduction to kryptonite, causing huge seizures; if Jenkins happened to get somebody, they could be shaken to death. Initially, the character is first observed striking into the entryway of LuthorCorp and murdering a security watch amid one of his seizures. To display a progressively great angle to the gathering of people, a scene in which Earl visits his newborn child tyke was added to demonstrate that he was not a "raving crazy person". Comparable reworks happened with the characters Ryan James (Ryan Kelley) in "Stray" and Tyler Randall (Reynaldo Rosales) in "Gatherer". In the first draft of "Stray", Ryan built up his clairvoyant capacities from presentation to kryptonite.; to accentuate the show was not constantly about kryptonite-contaminated miscreants, the story was reconsidered so that Ryan had his capacity from birth. The system likewise communicated disappointment with Ryan as a killer, so the character was changed to be the "decent child". The character of Tyler Randall shared Earl Jenkins' issue: he was not sufficiently thoughtful in the producers' eyes; expected to be a gotten away detainee, he was revised to be "the world's deadliest pleasant person".
