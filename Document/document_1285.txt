He was later exchanged to a private organization in Amityville, Long Island, where he endured a "fast plummet into frenzy". The "Reference book of World Biography" expresses that Barrymore was continually "frequented by the splendid and dull spell of his dad", and his dear companion Gene Fowler detailed that "the distressing suggestion of this breaking of his parent's reason never entirely decreased in Barrymore's brain, and he was spooky by fears he would endure a similar destiny". That year, Barrymore started an issue with an excellent specialists' model, ""Florodora" young lady" and hopeful performing artist named Evelyn Nesbit, who was a fancy woman of planner Stanford White. Barrymore later depicted Nesbit as "the most incensing woman.ÃÂ ... She was the primary lady I at any point adored", and he proposed marriage to her. Nesbit's mom did not imagine that, as a battling craftsman, Barrymore was a decent counterpart for her girl. To sever their relationship her mom sent Nesbit away to class in New Jersey. In 1906, White was shot in broad daylight by Nesbit's then-spouse, Pittsburgh mogul Harry K. Defrost.
