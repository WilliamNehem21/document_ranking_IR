Oan woke Lock at sunrise, persuaded that a gatecrasher was in the international safe haven. Lock was sent to examine, however no interloper was found. Later toward the beginning of the day, Oan called Lock to look at a lump in the divider isolating the Iranian international safe haven from the Ethiopian government office adjacent. The lump had, truth be told, been brought about by the expulsion of blocks to permit a strike group to get through the divider and to embed listening gadgets, bringing about a debilitating of the divider. In spite of the fact that Lock guaranteed him that he didn't trust the police were going to storm the structure, Oan stayed persuaded that they were "planning some mischief" and moved the male prisoners from the room in which they had gone through the most recent four days to another down the lobby. Pressures ascended for the duration of the morning and, at 13:00, Oan told the police that he would kill a prisoner except if he had the capacity to address an Arab minister inside 45 minutes. At 13:40, Lock educated the arbitrator that the shooters had taken Abbas Lavasani, the government office's central press officer, first floor and were getting ready to execute him. Lavasani, an ardent adherent to the Iranian Revolution, had over and over incited his captors amid the attack. As per Lock, Lavasani expressed that "on the off chance that they were going to kill a prisoner, [Lavasani] needed it to be him." At precisely 13:45, 45 minutes after Oan's interest to address a minister, three shots were gotten notification from inside the consulate.
