At the point when the book was discharged, commentators noticed that it was isolated into two sections, and conclusion was blended about Lee's capacity to interface them. The initial segment of the novel concerns the kids' interest with Boo Radley and their sentiments of wellbeing and solace in the area. Analysts were commonly enchanted by Scout and Jem's perceptions of their peculiar neighbors. One author was so inspired by Lee's point by point clarifications of the general population of Maycomb that he sorted the book as Southern sentimental regionalism. This sentimentalism can be found in Lee's portrayal of the Southern position framework to clarify pretty much every character's conduct in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra qualities Maycomb's occupants' shortcomings and focal points to ancestry (families that have betting streaks and drinking streaks), and the storyteller sets the activity and characters in the midst of a finely nitty gritty foundation of the Finch family ancestry and the historical backdrop of Maycomb. This regionalist subject is additionally reflected in Mayella Ewell's clear frailty to concede her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's meaning of "fine people" being individuals with great sense who do as well as can be expected with what they have. The South itself, with its conventions and taboos, appears to drive the plot more than the characters.
