There are different potential outcomes past franticness or religious enthusiasm that may have prompted Smart's repression: Newbery may have utilized the detainment of his child in-law as influence to control the distribution of Smart's work and as a notice to other people who worked for him not to cross him. Another hypothesis proposes Smart's activities were an aftereffect of liquor, and had nothing to do with a psychological lopsidedness. In any case, Smart may have been detained for humiliating his dad in-law here and there, which could have come about because of an episode in which Smart drank. Hester Thrale fortified this last probability when she asserted that Smart's "religious intensity" would in general correspond with times that Smart was inebriated. Keen's very own declaration that he "favored God in St. James' Park till I directed all the organization" ("Jubilate Agno" B 90Ã¢ÂÂ 91) as speaking to his religious frenzy is similarly expelled as coming about because of drinking, as he was known for pulling tricks and the Board of Green Cloth, the administration body that controlled St James' Park, would treat most aggravations in the recreation center as coming about because of franticness. On the off chance that Smart was put into the refuge because of activities at St James's, he would not have been the just one, since records demonstrate that the Board of Green Cloth was in charge of conceding sixteen individuals to Bethlem Hospital for "free for all" at St James' Park amid the century preceding Smart being put in St Luke's.
