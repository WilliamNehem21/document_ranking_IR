To acquire financing for the cyclotron that he needed, Oliphant kept in touch with the British head administrator, Neville Chamberlain, who was from Birmingham. Chamberlain took up the issue with his companion Lord Nuffield, who gave ÃÂ£60,000 () to the undertaking, enough for the cyclotron, another structure to house it, and an outing to Berkeley, California, so Oliphant could meet with Ernest Lawrence, the innovator of the cyclotron. Lawrence upheld the task, sending Oliphant the plans of the cyclotron that he was developing at Berkeley, and welcoming Oliphant to visit him at the Radiation Laboratory. Oliphant cruised for New York on 10 December 1938, and met Lawrence in Berkeley. The two men got along great, eating at "Merchant Vic's" in Oakland. Oliphant knew about the issues in structure cyclotrons experienced by Chadwick at the University of Liverpool and Cockcroft at the Cavendish Laboratory, and expected to stay away from these and get his cyclotron based on schedule and on spending plan by following Lawrence's details as intently as could be allowed. He trusted that it would keep running by Christmas 1939, however the episode of the Second World War subdued his expectations. The Nuffield Cyclotron would not be finished until after the war.
