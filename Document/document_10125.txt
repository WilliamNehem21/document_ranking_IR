In spite of the fact that both England and Scotland perceived Anne as their ruler, just the English Parliament had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the beneficiary possible. The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the progression question for the Scottish position of royalty. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill proclaiming that their determination for Queen Anne's successor would not be a similar individual as the successor to the English position of authority, except if England allowed full opportunity of exchange to Scottish dealers in England and its provinces. At first Royal Assent was retained, however the next year Anne gave in to the desires of the Estates and consent was allowed to the bill, which turned into the Act of Security 1704. Accordingly the English Parliament passed measures that took steps to confine Anglo-Scottish exchange and disabled person the Scottish economy if the Estates did not consent to the Hanoverian progression. In the long run, in 1707, the two Parliaments conceded to an Act of Union, which joined England and Scotland into a solitary political substance, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and set up the guidelines of progression as set somewhere around the Act of Settlement 1701. The association made the biggest unhindered commerce territory in eighteenth century Europe.
