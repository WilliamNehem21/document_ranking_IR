Following a year-long battle with throat malignant growth, encompassed by his family, Grant kicked the bucket at 8 o'clock in the first part of the day in the Mount McGregor cabin on July 23, 1885, at 63 years old. Sheridan, at that point Commanding General of the Army, requested multi day-long tribute to Grant on every military post, and President Grover Cleveland requested a thirty-day across the nation time of grieving. After private administrations, the ceremonial group put Grant's body on an uncommon burial service train, which headed out to West Point and New York City. A fourth of a million people saw it in the two days before the burial service. A huge number of men, a considerable lot of them veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic, walked with Grant's coffin drawn by two dozen dark stallions to Riverside Park in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. His pallbearers included Union commanders Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate officers Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and Senator John A. Logan, the leader of the GAR. Following the coffin in the parade were President Cleveland, the two living previous presidents Hayes and Arthur, the majority of the President's Cabinet, just as the judges of the Supreme Court.
