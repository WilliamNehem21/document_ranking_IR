Amid the late 1960s, forty-two percent of Hercules flying hours were dedicated to Australian Army activities. The C-130s attempted long-go missions to help Australian powers battling in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the organization of the first Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam in mid 1965, the RAAF started fortnightly C-130 flights into the nation from June that year. These flights were at first led by C-130As, and conveyed high-need payload and travelers from Richmond to Vung Tau in South Vietnam by means of either Butterworth or Singapore. The size of the supply flights into South Vietnam extended in 1967 when No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron RAAF, which was furnished with English Electric Canberra aircraft, was sent to Phan Rang. A huge carrier codenamed Winter Grip was likewise directed in mid-1967 to supplant two Australian Army forces, which had finished their year-long voyage through obligation, with a couple of crisp brigades. The Hercules were called upon to help the withdrawal of the first Australian Task Force (1ÃÂ ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos.ÃÂ 36 and 37 Squadrons attempted numerous forays to fly hardware and staff out of the nation amid 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were utilized to pull back the final Australian power in South Vietnam, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam; the last components of this power left on board two Hercules on 20ÃÂ December 1972.
