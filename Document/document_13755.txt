While Carly Darlin of "The Orange County Register" observed the collection to be "a lively and fun rehashing of the RHCP whiplash funk demeanor", she trusted that "except for the fantastic instrumental 'Really Little Ditty', it doesn't break any new ground." She proceeded by saying that, in the event that anything ""Mother's Milk" is a slight advance far from the gathering funk depressions of the last two collections and an arrival to the band's punk-shake roots. They even repeat the front of Jimi Hendrix's 'Flame', which they did as a B-side for their 'Battle Like A Brave' 12-inch two years prior." Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of "The Washington Post" said "the obliging term for collections as is 'Milk' 'mixed', yet it truly seems as though the band is disentangling [...] Considering the conditions, it's not particularly amazing that the collection is by all accounts searching for somebody to give it bearings." However, Jenkins believed Frusciante had "strong metal hacks and intends to demonstrate them off." "Town Voice" commentator Robert Christgau derided the band's capacity to advance sympathy and found the guitar layering in "Mother's Milk" to have been done inappropriately: "punks who adored Hendrix and P-Funk path route back, they're at long last taking advantage of their great taste, and however unbelievers dis their earnestness, execution's the issue. They didn't have the slashes to bring it off at that point, and by pushing the guitar in advance they sound much cruder at this point. In any case, they're flawlessly pleasant fellas, trulyÃ¢ÂÂnotice 'empathy' in the absolute first refrain."
