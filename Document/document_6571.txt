Estimating the attractive reverberation of precious stones initially included developing the gems, a basic technique frequently done by grade school understudies. The precious stones at that point must be set up by skillfully cutting them into areas with aspects that had an introduction not the same as the inside structure of the gem, and the reaction to an attractive field must be carefully estimated. While his gems were developing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism", which propelled a simpler strategy. He brought down a precious stone on a glass fiber appended to a torsion balance into an answer whose attractive weakness could be fluctuated between two attractive posts. When it coordinated that of the precious stone, the magnet could be turned on and off without exasperating the gem. The new technique not just required substantially less work, it additionally created an increasingly exact outcome. Rabi sent his proposition, entitled "On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals", to "Physical Review" on 16 July 1926. He wedded Helen the following day. The paper pulled in little exhibition in scholarly circles, in spite of the fact that it was perused by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who utilized the technique in his very own examinations of gems. Rabi reasoned that he expected to advance his work just as distribute it.
