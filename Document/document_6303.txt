The evening of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN propelled an unexpected assault on the Russian armada at Port Arthur. "Pobeda" was not hit in the underlying torpedo-pontoon assault, and sortied the next morning when the Combined Fleet, directed by Vice Admiral TÃÂgÃÂ HeihachirÃÂ, assaulted. TÃÂgÃÂ had expected the unexpected night assault by his boats to be significantly more fruitful than it was, envisioning that the Russians would be severely muddled and debilitated, however they had recouped from their astonishment and were prepared for his assault. The Japanese boats were spotted by the secured cruiser , which was watching seaward and alarmed the Russian protections. TÃÂgÃÂ assaulted the Russian beach front protections with his fundamental combat hardware and draw in the boats with his auxiliary firearms. Part his shoot turned out to be a poor choice as the Japanese and six-inch firearms delivered little harm on the Russian boats, which focused all their flame on the Japanese boats with some impact. "Pobeda" was hit on more than one occasion amidships close to the waterline, losing two men murdered and four injured, yet the shell(s) neglected to enter the ship's defensive layer and little harm was finished.
