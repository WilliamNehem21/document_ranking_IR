The species was first portrayed in 1877, the first of many related species from the locale depicted until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman merged most into the single species "Oryzomys couesi" and in 1960 Raymond Hall joined this taxon with its United States relative, the swamp rice rodent ("O.ÃÂ palustris"), into a solitary boundless animal groups; along these lines, many related, limited species held by Goldman were additionally incorporated into this taxon. After investigations of the contact zone in Texas, where "O.ÃÂ couesi" and the swamp rice rodent meet, were distributed in 1979 and underscored the uniqueness of the two, they were again viewed as isolated. From that point forward, a portion of the fringe types of the gathering, for example, "Oryzomys antillarum" from Jamaica and "Oryzomys peninsulae" from the Baja California Peninsula, have been restored as species. In any case, "O.ÃÂ couesi" as at present comprised is likely a composite of a few animal varieties; a recent report, utilizing DNA succession information, discovered proof to perceive separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the appropriation of "O.ÃÂ couesi" and two extra species from Panama and Costa Rica. By and large, "Oryzomys couesi" is normal and of no protection concern, and it is even viewed as a plague animal types in spots, yet a few populaces are compromised.
