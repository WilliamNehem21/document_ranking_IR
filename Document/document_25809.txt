"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" claims that state television was "the only channel to which [ChÃ¡vez] had access", but does not mention that during the violence he requisitioned "all radio and TV frequencies" to broadcast his two-hour address. Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen, showing ChÃ¡vez's address on one side and footage of the violence on the other. ChÃ¡vez subsequently took television stations RCTV and VenevisiÃ³n off the air. The film's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition "plotters" is also disputed; according to "X-Ray of a Lie" and Gunson, staff left willingly. Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV's signal being cutâmid-interview with a government legislatorâwas fabricated. Bartley and ÃÂ Briain say they witnessed ministers' being unable to broadcast and that the International Federation of Journalists corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV. The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace, which Gunson says were there at the request of the president, not the opposition. He also challenges the film for presenting ChÃ¡vez's supporters as "invariably poor, brown-skinned, and cheerful" and the opposition as "rich, white, racist, and violent". He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters "made the center of Caracas a no-go area". Bartley and ÃÂ Briain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that ChÃ¡vez's supporters "were broadly poor and dark-skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class", including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in "The Christian Science Monitor". Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media "behaved disgracefully" by "systematically [excluding the pro-ChÃ¡vez] viewpoint from print, radio, and TV" during the period of the coup.
