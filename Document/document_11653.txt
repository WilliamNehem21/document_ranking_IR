David S. Berman and McIntosh in 1978 alluded "Cetiosauriscus" to the family Diplodocidae alongside various other genera; "Diplodocus", "Apatosaurus", "Barosaurus", "Mamenchisaurus" "Dicraeosaurus" and "Nemegtosaurus". Like different individuals from the family, "Cetiosauriscus" has wing-like transverse procedures, partitioned chevrons with forward and in reverse projections, the tail is "whiplash"- like, the humerus is 2/3 the length of the femur, the calcaneum is missing, metatarsal III and IV are the longest, and metatarsal I has a procedure on the base back corner. This referral would make "Cetiosauriscus", known from the Callovian, the most established diplodocid, a great many years more seasoned than "Diplodocus", "Barosaurus" or "Apatosaurus". In the paper naming "Cetiosauriscus stewarti", Charig additionally portrayed the chevrons of another example and made the expression "diplodociform" to depict them. This implied they were vigorous and twofold transmitted, as in "Diplodocus" and its relatives like "Mamenchisaurus". On account of the comparatively "diplodociform" chevrons, Charig alluded "Cetiosauriscus" to the Diplodocidae alongside the new example. Expounding upon his prior paper, McIntosh (1990) pitifully alluded "Cetiosauriscus" to the subfamily Diplodocinae, described by more cervicals and less dorsals, tall sacrum neural spines, short forelimbs, no calcaneum, metatarsals III and IV being the longest, and a little procedure on the distal end of metatarsal I. The subfamily additionally included "Diplodocus", "Barosaurus" and "Apatosaurus". In 2004 this situation was trailed by Weishampel "et al." without remark.
