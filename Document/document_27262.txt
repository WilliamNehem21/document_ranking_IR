In February 1946, Mutual introduced a quiz show, "Twenty Questions", that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series "Let George Do It", starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show "Smile Time", out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented "Family Theater" premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: "Kate Smith Speaks", at noon, and "Kate Smith Sings", later in the hour. The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology "Quiet, Please", which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, "Box 13", which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.
