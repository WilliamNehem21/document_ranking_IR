In 2013, ITV commissioned a drama about Jefferies' arrest. Filming of the two-part series, starring Jason Watkins in the leading role, began in November. The "Bristol Post" reported that Jefferies had read and approved the script, and supported the project. The drama, titled "The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies", aired on 10 and 11 December 2014. In May 2015, it won two awards at the 2015 British Academy Television Awardsâbest mini-series for the programme itself, and best actor for Watkins' portrayal of Jefferies. On 26 March 2015, the case was the subject of an episode of the Channel 5 documentary series "Countdown to Murder", titled "The Killer Next Door: The Last Hours of Joanna Yeates".
Jefferies has since given his account of what happened, and described to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: "At the time it felt as if the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It was a form of psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable."
