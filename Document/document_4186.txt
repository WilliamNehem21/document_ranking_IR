Blakeney Chapel is a demolished structure on the Norfolk bank of England. Regardless of its name, it is in the ward of Cley next the Sea, not the connecting town of Blakeney, and was presumably not a sanctuary. The structure remained on a raised hill or "eye" on the toward the ocean end of the seaside swamps, not exactly from the ocean and just toward the north of the momentum channel of the River Glaven where it swings to run parallel to the shoreline. It comprised of two rectangular rooms of unequal size, and seems, by all accounts, to be flawless in a 1586 guide, however is appeared as vestiges in later outlines. Just the establishments and part of a divider still remain. Three archeological examinations somewhere in the range of 1998 and 2005 gave more detail of the development, and demonstrated two unmistakable times of dynamic use. In spite of the fact that it is portrayed as a house of prayer on a few maps, there is no narrative or archeological proof to propose that it had any religious capacity. A little hearth, likely utilized for refining iron, is the main proof of a particular action on the site.
