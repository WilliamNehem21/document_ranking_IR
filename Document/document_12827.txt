The German withdrawal permitted "Slava", after fixes, to change to her other assignment and bolster the military with gunfire. Amid one of these missions, as she was besieging German positions close Tukums on 25 September 1915, she was hit in the conning tower while at stay, slaughtering her commander and five others. McLaughlin credits the hit to German field gunnery, however Nekrasov cites German records that ascribe it to a bomb dropped by one of a couple of German seaplanes. "Slava" stayed in position and continued her barrage. She kept on supporting the Army until the water in the Gulf of Riga took steps to solidify over at which time she resigned to the port of Kuivastu to winter over. While still in port she was hit by three light bombs dropped by a seaplane on 12 April 1916; these did minimal material harm, however murdered seven mariners. On 2 July she continued her help of the military with a siege of propelling German troops in spite of supporting one hit by a shell on her waterline protective layer that caused no harm. She rehashed these missions various occasions in July and August. These irritated the Germans enough that they endeavored to sink "Slava" with a planned trap by the submarine and low-flying torpedo aircraft as she reacted to a bluff by German cruisers on 12 September, yet all their torpedoes missed. This was the principal assault by torpedo aircraft against a moving ship.
