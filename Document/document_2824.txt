The soonest scholarly references to Arthur originate from Welsh and Breton sources. There have been not many endeavors to characterize the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian convention overall, as opposed to in a solitary content or content/story-type. A 2007 scholarly overview that attempts this by Caitlin Green distinguishes three key strands to the depiction of Arthur in this most punctual material. The first is that he was a consummate warrior who worked as the beast chasing defender of Britain from all inside and outside dangers. A portion of these are human dangers, for example, the Saxons he battles in the "Historia Brittonum", however the dominant part are extraordinary, including mammoth feline beasts, damaging celestial hogs, mythical serpents, dogheads, monsters, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of old stories (especially topographic or onomastic legends) and confined mysterious marvel stories, the pioneer of a band of superhuman saints who live in the wilds of the scene. The third and last strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a nearby association with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. From one viewpoint, he dispatches attacks on Otherworldly posts looking for fortune and liberates their detainees. On different, his warband in the soonest sources incorporates previous agnostic divine beings, and his better half and his assets are obviously Otherworldly in root.
