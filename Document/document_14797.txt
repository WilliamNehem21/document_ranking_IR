Bricklayer's biographers and translators have since quite a while ago varied about how to exhibit his perspectives on servitude related issues. A two-volume history (1892) by Kate Mason Rowland, who Broadwater noted was "a thoughtful white southerner composition amid the prime of Jim Crow" denied that Mason (her predecessor) was "an "abolitionist" in the advanced feeling of the term". She noticed that Mason "lamented" that there was subjugation and was against the slave exchange, yet needed servitude secured in the constitution. In 1919, Robert C. Artisan distributed a life story of his noticeable predecessor and stated that George Mason "consented to free his very own slaves and was the main known abolitionist", declining to sign the constitution, among different reasons in light of the fact that "as it stood then it didn't annul subjection or make planning for its continuous annihilation". Rutland, writing in 1961, stated that in Mason's last days, "just the alliance [between New England and the Deep South at the Constitutional Convention] in Philadelphia that had bartered away any desire for taking out bondage left a buildup of appall." Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her generally perused 1966 record of the Constitutional Convention, "Supernatural occurrence at Philadelphia", fought that Mason trusted captives to be natives and was "an intense abolitionist before the word was begat".
