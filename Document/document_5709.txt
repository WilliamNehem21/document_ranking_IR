Fundamentally, the lbw law continued as before somewhere in the range of 1839 and 1937, in spite of a few crusades to have it changed. A 1863 proposition to enable a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body anytime between the wickets, paying little mind to where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket by any stretch of the imagination, came to nothing. There were not many protests until the extent of lbw rejections in district cricket started to increment amid the 1880s. Up to that point, batsmen utilized their cushions just to ensure their legs; their utilization for some other reasons for existing was viewed as unsporting, and some novice cricketers did not wear them by any stretch of the imagination. As cricket turned out to be increasingly composed and aggressive, some batsmen started to utilize their cushions as a second line of resistance: they arranged them according to the ball so that on the off chance that they missed with the bat, the ball struck the cushion rather than the wicket. A few players took this further; if the conveyance was not a simple one from which to score runs, they endeavored no shot and enabled the ball to bob securely off their cushions. Arthur Shrewsbury was the primary noticeable player to utilize such techniques, and others pursued. Analysis of this training was elevated by the expanded quality and unwavering quality of cricket pitches, which made batting simpler, prompted higher scores and made an apparent irregularity in the diversion.
