Wendover Boulevard was numbered USÂ 40 through what are now the cities of West Wendover and Wendover beginning in 1926. USÂ 40 was the major thoroughfare between San Francisco, in the west, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the east. USÂ 40 was routed along the Wendover Cut-off, now known as Frontage Road, which was retained as a service road after the completion of the I-80. The USÂ 40 designation was removed by 1976 or 1977, when I-80 was completed through the area. The designation of roadway now numbered USÂ 93Â Alt. has changed twice in the past. Between 1932 and 1953, it was designated USÂ 50, and between 1954 and either 1978 and 1979, it was designated USÂ 50Â Alt.
Two other roads have been numbered Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 was formed in 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was decommissioned in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly USÂ 40. Wendover Boulevard between USÂ 93Â Alt. and the state line was designated SRÂ 224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.
