At the Southern Railway's January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it was chosen to use outside temporary workers to manufacture the KÃÂ class, Maunsell got expert to hold one lot of parts at Ashford attempts to build a model 3-barrel 2-6-4 tank. The alteration depended on that utilized on NÃÂ class No.ÃÂ 822 to create a 3-barrel train in 1922, in spite of the fact that it held the driving haggles wheelbase of the KÃÂ class. The alteration was the consideration of an extra (inside) barrel between the edges, and a wrench hub was fitted to the center driving wheels. The pivot was associated with within chamber get together by an interfacing pole slanted at 1 out of 8 to clear the front driving hub. This course of action was enhanced by two littler distance across outside chambers with bore (contrasted with the barrels of the KÃÂ class), and a more noteworthy stack breadth. The subsequent model 3-barrel "K1" was smaller than the KÃÂ class and consequently could chip away at courses with confined stacking check. As with No.ÃÂ 822, this train utilized Holcroft's subordinate of the Gresley conjugated valve apparatus to drive within chamber. To oblige this, the kettle must be raised by over within apparatus, raising the focal point of gravity on the train.
