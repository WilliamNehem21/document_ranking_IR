At the point when the time sought formative and operational testing of the SAW hopefuls, three 5.56ÃÂ mm applicant weapons were incorporated with the 6ÃÂ mm competitors: the M16 HBAR, an overwhelming barrel variation of the M16 intended for delayed discharging; the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN) Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The underlying round of tests finished in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were chosen for further improvement. As of now, sentiments of the 6ÃÂ mm cartridge were starting to acrid because of the strategic ramifications of giving one more ammo type to the infantry. In June, it was mentioned that the SAW determinations archive be modified to underline standard 5.56ÃÂ mm ammo. In October, the mentioned modifications were endorsed, and offers were requested for the transformation of the Rodman XM235 to 5.56ÃÂ mm. Generation of the changed over XM235 was granted to Ford Aerospace, and its assignment was changed to XM248. Another M16 HBAR variation, the XM106, was created in 1978, and before long, Heckler and Koch campaigned to incorporate a 5.56ÃÂ mm transformation of its HK 21A1 (rather than the standard 7.62ÃÂ mm NATO ammo it was worked for) in future SAW testing. The last model was assigned the XM262. Right now, the Minimi got the assignment XM249. Testing of the four competitors continued in April 1979.
