Every single recognizable fossil of "Albertosaurus stone casket" are known from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. These more youthful units of this geologic arrangement date to the early Maastrichtian phase of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years prior). Promptly underneath this development is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine arrangement speaking to a segment of the Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was retreating as the atmosphere cooled and ocean levels died down towards the finish of the Cretaceous, uncovering land that had recently been submerged. It was anything but a smooth procedure, be that as it may, and the seaway would occasionally ascend to cover portions of the area all through Horseshoe Canyon before at last retreating inside and out in the years after. Because of the changing ocean levels, a wide range of situations are spoken to in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including seaward and close shore marine natural surroundings and beach front living spaces like tidal ponds, estuaries and salt marshes. Various coal creases speak to antiquated peat swamps. Like the majority of the other vertebrate fossils from the development, "Albertosaurus" remains are found in stores set down in the deltas and floodplains of substantial streams amid the later 50% of Horseshoe Canyon times.
