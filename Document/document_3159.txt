On 5 April 1917, 1RNR crossed the Songwe River into German East Africa and propelled south-east towards Kitanda. It climbed the winding Lupa River, crossing it at each turn, for 53 days, and by mid-June was north of its objective. When it was then arranged to backtrack north to Rungwe, it canvassed the in 16 days. A few researchers feature the separations walked by the RNR, and remark that their physical continuance more likely than not been wonderful, especially given the speed at which they moved. "One can just wonder about the solidness and mettle of these men who unassumingly walked separations unbelievable to present day Western warriors," the antiquarian Alexandre Binda composes. McLaughlin contrasts the RNR's dark troopers with the white warriors of the second Rhodesia Regiment, remarking that the previous demonstrated unmistakably stronger to tropical illnesses (however not safe), and astounded white onlookers by not simply adjusting to the troublesome East African conditions, yet regularly walking in multi day. In June 1917, Sergeant Rita (or Lita), a dark non-appointed officer later depicted by Tomlinson as "a magnificent trooper", got the most elevated honor at any point given to a RNR "askari", the Distinguished Conduct Medal, "for obvious valor in real life on numerous events. His precedent and impact with his men is limitless".
