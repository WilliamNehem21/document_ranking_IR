The requirement for a copper coinage was no less after the promotion of King George I (1714Ã¢ÂÂ 1727), however the Anne halfpennies and farthings (made with metal arranged at the Royal Mint) had fizzled tests for virtue, and it was not until 1717 that Newton attempted to coin those two groups once more, this time from copper strip bought from a contractual worker. The cost of metal had risen, so the new farthings were lighter than the Anne coins, at 4.5Ã¢ÂÂ 5.3ÃÂ grams. The farthings struck in 1717 were littler and thicker than the 1714 coins, with a breadth of 20Ã¢ÂÂ 21 millimeters, and they are known as "dump" farthings. Farthings of 1719Ã¢ÂÂ 1724 are marginally bigger, at 22Ã¢ÂÂ 23 millimeters, yet are of a similar weight. The coins were in high help, and the Royal Mint experienced difficulty exchanging the structure to the spaces, bringing about bunch defects. The coin includes the right-confronting head of King George and the engraving on the front, and for the switch a plan indistinguishable to that of the Anne farthings: Britannia with the engraving and the date in the exergue beneath. Farthings were available to be purchased at the Mint's premises at the Tower of London in bundles of five and ten shillings; the Treasury would not allot assets for common circulation. The farthing's plans were by John Croker, conceivably helped by Johann Rudolph Ochs Sr, and were struck in consistently from 1717Ã¢ÂÂ 1724. The Mint had contracted for strip for a long time; when the agreement finished, the coinage ceased.
