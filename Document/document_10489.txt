Unfit to contact U2 chief Paul McGuinness, Peter Shapiro rather proposed the plan to Owens. The last was inquiring about workmanship content for the up and coming Vertigo Tour and figured the idea could be utilized to indicate 3D video as a major aspect of U2's shows. Shapiro clarified that the innovation was not so created and essentially needed to archive the visit itself in 3D, yet Owens was not keen on making a film of the band, dreading it would meddle with the visit, so she declined the offer. After Shapiro demonstrated Owens the 3D film of the NFL recreations, Owens communicated enthusiasm for coordinating the proposed film, in spite of having no past understanding. As indicated by bassist Adam Clayton, U2 were not keen on making another show film, however Owens "drove it down [their] throats". When the band saw the test shots, frontman Bono communicated enthusiasm for the task and persuaded his bandmates to submit. Since U2 had just explored different avenues regarding video innovation before, they were keen on the venture as a mechanical analysis as opposed to a way to make benefit, and as a way to impart the live understanding to fans who couldn't manage the cost of show tickets.
