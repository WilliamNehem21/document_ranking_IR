At the season of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a local sub-division utilized in the Middle Ages by medieval and crown authorities to manage networks. In spite of the fact that the Hundred of Eyhorne (counting Wormshill) still exists, it is a medieval erroneous date and never again has any commonsense or regulatory noteworthiness. In the nineteenth century, the town was inside the machine of Aylesford, the Bearsted insignificant sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The town was likewise fused into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a methods for subsidizing and directing the activity of the Poor Laws in the territory). The ward of Wormshill to some extent sits with on leg on each side of the West Kent and East Kent partition, a division which until 1814 connected to a regulatory limit for the reasons for the law courts' Quarter Sessions. As indicated by Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): "northward of the congregation, including the precinct of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, yet its remainder, including the congregation and town, is in that of West Kent". This contrasts from the conventional qualification between "Men of Kent" and "Kentish Men", which are isolated by the River Medway, as needs be people conceived in Wormshill would be "Men of Kent".
