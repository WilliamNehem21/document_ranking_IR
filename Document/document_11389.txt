The commission originally expected to site the commemoration at Temple Steps, on the bank of the River Thames, for which it authorized Lutyens. The engineer structured a huge curve. The proposed structure would have comprised of two stone docks of connected, rotating curves (reminiscent of the Thiepval Memorial, which he was planning for the IWGC at around a similar time) joined by a vast pillar, itself upheld by two Doric sections between the curves. This was affirmed by London County Council, however the Office of Works rejected it on the exhortation of the Royal Fine Arts Commission (RFAC), which protested on two grounds: first, that Lutyens' proposition would include the annihilation of a curve assembled when the Thames Embankment was developed; and second, that the remembrance would be more qualified to a site further downstream, east of Tower Bridge, where it would be seen by maritime vessels which couldn't travel west of the scaffold. Both Lutyens and Ware endeavored to induce the RFAC to rethink however without any result. Lutyens was incensed, feeling that the shipper sailors had been consigned to "some gap in the corner since they happened to be low in societal position", and that Sir Reginald Blomfield (an individual from the RFAC and an opponent of Lutyens) was carrying on of hate.
