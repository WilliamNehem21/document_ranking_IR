The Glades culture is separated into three periods dependent on proof found in middens. In 1947, paleontologist John Goggin portrayed the three time frames in the wake of looking at shell hills. He uncovered one on Matecumbe Key, another at Gordon Pass close cutting edge Naples, and a third south of Lake Okeechobee close advanced Belle Glade. The Glades I culture, enduring from 500 BCE to 800 CE, was clearly engaged around Gordon Pass and is viewed as the least modern because of the absence of antiquities. What has been foundÃ¢ÂÂfundamentally earthenwareÃ¢ÂÂis lumpy and plain. With the approach of an entrenched culture in 800 CE, the Glades II period is described by progressively luxurious earthenware, wide utilization of instruments all through the South Florida district, and the presence of religious antiques at entombment locales. By 1200, the Glades III culture showed the tallness of their advancement. Ceramics wound up sufficiently luxurious to be subdivided into kinds of beautification. All the more vitally, proof of an extending society is uncovered through the improvement of stately adornments produced using shell, and the development of substantial earthworks related with entombment ceremonies. From the Glades III culture created two unmistakable clans that lived in and close to the Everglades in the memorable period: the Calusa and the Tequesta.
