On March 17, 2004, Love appeared on the "Late Show with David Letterman" to promote the recently-released "America's Sweetheart". Her appearance drew media coverage when, during the interview segment, she lifted her shirt multiple times, flashed Letterman, and stood on his desk. A "New York Times" article noted: "The episode was not altogether surprising for Ms. Love, 39, whose most public moments have veered from extreme pathosâlike the time she read the suicide note of her famous husband, Kurt Cobain, on MTVâto angry feminism to catfights to incoherent ranting." Hours later, in the early morning of March 18, Love was arrested in Manhattan for allegedly striking a 23-year-old male fan with a microphone stand during a small concert she performed at an East Village venue. She was released within hours of the incident, enabling her to perform a concert scheduled for the following evening at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, she called in multiple times to "The Howard Stern Show", claiming in broadcast conversations with Stern that the incident had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest.
