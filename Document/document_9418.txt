Keith Phipps, composing for "The A.V. Club", commended the scene, appraised it an AÃ¢ÂÂ, and depicted Hutchison's job as "the part that would dispatch [him] as a go-to character performing artist for downer parts". Phipps felt the climactic scene in which Tooms invades Scully's house is "the scene that makes the scene", taking note of that there was "a genuine feeling of risk" notwithstanding it being certain that Scully, a lead character, was not going to come to hurt. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Needing to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen", note that the scene's reason is the first in the arrangement "not to depend upon acknowledged urban legends". It passes on its "silly" plot through proposal, leaving any enhancements groupings of Tooms' capacities until the crowd is "as of now appropriately changed in accordance with the ridiculousness". Be that as it may, Shearman and Pearson found the monolog comparing the wrongdoings submitted by Tooms to the Holocaust, given by the resigned criminologist Briggs, to be "pointless as well as boring to boot". They evaluated the scene four stars out of five. Mumtaj Begum, composing for Malaysia's "The Star", portrayed "Crush" as "the scene that truly sold "The X-Files" thought to the majority", and called it "just splendid".
