Storm Pongsona was the last tropical storm of the period, and was the second costliest fiasco in 2002 in the United States and its regions. It framed on DecemberÃÂ 2, having begun as a zone of convection toward the east-southeast of Pohnpei in late November. With an edge toward the north, the misery followed commonly westbound for a few days, escalating into Tropical Storm Pongsona on DecemberÃÂ 3. After an eye created on DecemberÃÂ 5, the tempest achieved tropical storm status toward the north of Chuuk. Enduring increase proceeded, until it turned out to be increasingly fast on DecemberÃÂ 8 while moving toward Guam. That day, the JMA evaluated top breezes of 165ÃÂ km/h (105ÃÂ mph), and the JTWC assessed crest winds of 240ÃÂ km/h (150ÃÂ mph), making Pongsona a super tropical storm. Around its pinnacle force, the eye of the tropical storm moved over Guam and Rota. Subsequent to striking Guam, Pongsona started moving toward the north and later toward the upper east, rapidly debilitating because of the nearness of dry air and collaboration with a moving toward mid-scope storm. After the convection lessened over the inside, Pongsona moved toward becoming extratropical at an opportune time DecemberÃÂ 11. Promptly the following day, it scattered east of Japan.
