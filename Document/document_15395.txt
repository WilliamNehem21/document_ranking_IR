Affleck became more involved with television and film production in the early 2000s. He and Damon had set up Pearl Street Films in 1998, named after the street that ran between their childhood homes. Their next production company LivePlanet, co-founded in 2000 with Sean Bailey and Chris Moore, sought to integrate the Internet into mainstream television and film production. LivePlanet's biggest success was the documentary series "Project Greenlight", aired on HBO and later Bravo, which focused on first-time filmmakers being given the chance to direct a feature film. "Project Greenlight" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004 and 2005. "Push, Nevada" (2002), created, written and produced by Affleck and Bailey, was an ABC mystery drama series that placed a viewer-participation game within the frame of the show. Caryn James of "The New York Times" praised the show's "nerve, imagination and clever writing", but Robert Bianco of "USA Today" described it as a "knock-off" of "Twin Peaks". The show was cancelled by ABC after seven episodes due to low ratings. Over time, LivePlanet's focus shifted from multimedia projects to more traditional film production. Affleck and his partners signed a film production deal with Disney in 2002; it expired in 2007.
