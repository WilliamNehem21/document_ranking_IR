In the late 1940s, both "Exciting Wonder" and "Frightening Stories" started to distribute substantially more develop fiction than they had amid the war, and albeit "Surprising" was as yet the main magazine in the field, it was never again the main market for the scholars who had been normally pitching to Campbell. A large number of the best new scholars still broke into print in "Shocking" as opposed to somewhere else. Arthur C. Clarke's first story, "Proviso", showed up in the April 1946 "Astonishing", and another British author, Christopher Youd, started his profession with "Christmas Tree" in February 1949. Youd would turn out to be greatly improved known under his alias "Christopher". William Tenn's first deal, "Alexander the Bait", showed up in May 1946, and H. Pillar Piper's "Over and over" in the April 1947 issue was his first story. Alongside these more up to date scholars, Campbell was all the while distributing solid material by creators who had turned out to be built up amid the war. Among the better-known accounts of this time are "Vintage Season", by C.L. Moore (under the nom de plume O'Donnell); Jack Williamson's story "With Folded Hands"; "The Players of Null-A", van Vogt's continuation of "The World of Null-An"; and the last book in E.E. Smith's "Lensman" arrangement, "Offspring of the Lens".
