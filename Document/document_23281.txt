It has been the number 1 film on IMDb's user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed "The Godfather", having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s. In the United Kingdom, readers of "Empire" magazine voted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four on "Empire"s 2008 list of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time" and their 2017 list of "The 100 Greatest Movies". In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their favorite film of all time. It regularly appears on "Empire"s top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll by Sky UK (it lost to "Forrest Gump"), and ranked as Britain's favorite film in a 2015 YouGov poll. When the British Film Institute analyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted that "The Shawshank Redemption" was not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlike "Pulp Fiction" which fared better with younger voters, and "Gone with the Wind" (1939) with older voters. A 2017 poll conducted by Gatwick Airport also identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight. When film critic Mark Kermode interviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a "religious experience". It was also voted as New Zealand's favorite film in a 2015 poll.
