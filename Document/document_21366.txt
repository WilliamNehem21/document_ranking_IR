Winning six of their first eight matches in 1984â85, York were top of the Third Division by early October 1984. After a run of two wins from 11 matches, they slipped to 11th place in mid December 1984, though they continued to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place. In January 1985, York beat First Division team Arsenal 1â0 at home in the FA Cup fourth round, courtesy of a late penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They reached the fifth round for the third time and drew 1â1 at home to European Cup holders Liverpool. They lost 7â0 in the replay at Anfieldâthe club's record cup defeat. York started 1985â86 well and were second in the table by late November 1985, before a poor midseason spell saw them drop into midtable. After being unbeaten in the last nine matches, they finished seventh in the table, marking the fifth consecutive season in which York's end-of-season league placing improved. They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season, again drawing 1â1 at home to Liverpool, before losing 3â1 after extra time at Anfield. York made a strong start to 1986â87, and in late September 1986 they were in second place. They won only seven of their remaining 38 matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation, which they achieved with a 1â1 draw against Notts County. York finished 1986â87 in 20th place.
