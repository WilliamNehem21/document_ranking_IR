Looked with extraordinary challenge from different space explorers, especially John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking and embraced Glenn's propensity for taking a morning run, in spite of the fact that he went poorly far as to surrender the mixed drinks or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the chief of NASA's Space Task Group, educated the seven space travelers that Shepard had been decided for the main American kept an eye on mission into space. Shepard later reviewed Louise's reaction when he revealed to her that she had her arms around the man who might be the main man in space: "Who let a Russian in here?" During preparing he flew 120 mimicked flights. Despite the fact that his flight was initially booked for April 26, 1960, it was delayed a few times by spontaneous preliminary work, at first to December 5, 1960, at that point mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, lastly to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin turned into the main individual in space, and the first to circle the Earth. It was another body hit to American pride. At the point when Shepard heard the news he pummeled his clench hand down on a table so hard a NASA open connection officer dreaded he may have broken it.
