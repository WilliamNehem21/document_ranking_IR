Its area is obscure until a stock of 1544, when it had a place with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, maybe as a legacy from his precursors the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. It probably go to the Austrian part of the Habsburgs on Charles V's demise, as it is recorded in a few inventories of the Imperial Schatzkammer ("treasure chamber") in Vienna from 1677 onwards. It stayed in Vienna until after 1860, when it showed up in a display. Some time after this it was sent to be reestablished by Salomon Weininger, a workmanship seller with access to talented experts, who covertly made various duplicates. He was later indicted for different fabrications, and passed on in jail in 1879, yet it was as yet not understood that he had returned one of his duplicates of the reliquary to the Imperial accumulations rather than the first. The Viennese Rothschild family purchased the first reliquary by 1872, in numbness of its provenance; it was acquired by Ferdinand de Rothschild, who moved to England, and fabricated Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. One of the duplicates stayed in the Ecclesiastical Treasury of the Imperial Habsburg Court in Vienna, where the double dealing stayed undetected for a very long while.
