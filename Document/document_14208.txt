As leader and ruler in Egypt, al-Ikhshid was a patient and wary man. He accomplished his objectives as much by discretion and binds to ground-breaking personages in the Baghdad routine as by power, and still, at the end of the day he would in general stay away from direct military showdown at whatever point conceivable. His contention with Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was characteristic of his methodology: rather than an immediate conflict, the ceasefire between the two gave al-Ikhshid an opportunity to survey the circumstance in Egypt before acting. Albeit following in the strides of Ibn Tulun, his desire were progressively unobtrusive and his targets increasingly reasonable, as turned out to be especially obvious in his strategies towards Syria and the remainder of the Caliphate. Truly, ownership of Syria, and especially Palestine, was an outside approach objective for some leaders of Egypt, to abandon the undoubtedly attack course into the nation. Ibn Tulun previously and Saladin after al-Ikhshid were two regular instances of Egyptian rulers who spent quite a bit of their rules verifying control of Syria, and to be sure utilized Egypt for the most part as a wellspring of income and assets to achieve this objective. Al-Ikhshid varied from them; Bacharach portrays him as a "mindful, preservationist pragmatist". His objectives were restricted yet clear: his fundamental concern was Egypt appropriate and the foundation of his family as an innate line over it, while Syria remained an optional goal. Not at all like other military strongmen of the time, he had no expectation of participate in the challenge for control of Baghdad and the caliphal government through the almighty office of "amir al-umara"; in fact, when Caliph al-Mustakfi (r. 944Ã¢ÂÂ 946) offered him the post, he turned it down.
