Upon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count FÃ¼rstenberg, in the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1704 the FÃ¼rstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of FÃ¼rstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince ("FÃ¼rst") of FÃ¼rstenberg (German: "FÃ¼rst zu FÃ¼rstenberg"). The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728â1783), Karl BorromÃ¤us Egon (1729â1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's second son. This son, Karl BorromÃ¤us Egon, had died in 1787. 
Karl BorromÃ¤us Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 â 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 â 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von FÃ¼rstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of FÃ¼rstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu FÃ¼rstenberg.
