As a feature of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year-winning "Virtuoso Loves Company", the tune turned out to be the most famous and widely praised on the collection. Despite the fact that the melody had its initial spoilers, it got for the most part great audits. A few analysts noticed the complementarity of Jones and Charles. "The Daily Vault" Jason Warburg depicted the tune as a "lively, smooth pas de deux" in which Charles matches Jones note for note." "JazzTimes"' Christopher Loudon said Charles "mixes flawlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-buckram" execution. The tune was depicted by the "Orlando Sentinel" Jim Abbott as an entertainment of one of the jewels from Charles' down home music period of the 1960s that created the ideal "blend of voices and instruments" with Preston's going with job on Hammond B3. Instead of different tracks on the collection, when Charles' voice was downplayed, this tune was said to speak to his "unstoppable soul", while Jones executed as "a compassionate foil, [with] her warm, apathetic vocals fitting pleasantly with his over an extra yet astounding game plan". Creator Mike Evans composed that "there's a common warmth of direction in each breath [Charles and Jones] take" on the tune. "Music Week" staff noticed the auspiciousness of the discharge with the anecdotal film "Beam" in theaters and portrayed the tune as heartfelt, that finely joins Charles' "profound, sugary snarl with Jones' lighter timber", while taking note of Preston for his "clearing" organ work.
