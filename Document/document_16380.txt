"Doomsday" is one of the most popular episodes of the revived "Doctor Who". It gained an audience Appreciation Index (AI) of 89, which was the highest figure for nearly two yearsâit was later surpassed by "The Stolen Earth", which had an AI of 91âand is the first episode of "Doctor Who" to receive a perfect 10 rating on "IGN", who congratulated Davies on making an action-packed episode so emotional. "Television Without Pity" gave the episode an A+ rating. "The Stage" commented that the Dalek-Cybermen conflict was the "only thing worth watching" at the weekend, overshadowing even the World Cup Final, and that the parting scene was "beautifully written and movingly played," with "not a dry eye in the universe". Dek Hogan of "Digital Spy" felt that the episode was "beautifully balanced and with moments of high excitement and touching poignancy" and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman version of Hartman was a "nice touch". He criticised Catherine Tate's appearance as being unnecessary to end the episode and for "breaking the mood". Stephen Brook of "The Guardian" thought that the episode was "a highpoint of the modern series, highly emotional, scary and genuinely exciting", while Rose's departure was "brilliantly handled". He positively compared the episode's plot of a war between "the greatest monsters in the programme history" against the film "Alien vs. Predator".
