Newspapers covering "Enterprise"s cancellation and its final episode often said that the failure of "Enterprise" was evidence that the franchise had moved too far from its roots and grown too dark. Andy Dehnhart of MSNBC said that "while the writers and production designers deserve credit for offering worlds that were perhaps slightly more believable, they lost the fantastic, wondrous approach to space travel that "The Next Generation" borrowed from the original "Star Trek" and then perfected." "USA Today"s Michael Peck said that without the "dreams" of earlier series, ""Star Trek" becomes just another television drama." Melanie McFarland of the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", meanwhile, said the show "never found the sense of uniqueness within the "Trek" universe that every version that came before it possessed." Despite the cancellation, Paramount remained optimistic. Studio head David Stapf looked "forward to a new chapter of this enduring franchise in the future." Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendrensen developed a concept for a new film taking place after "Enterprise" but before the 1960s television show. Meanwhile, Paramount asked Roberto Orci for ideas to revive the franchise, resulting in the production of a reboot film set in an alternate timeline from the 1966â2005 franchise simply titled "Star Trek", released in May 2009 and directed by J. J. Abrams.
