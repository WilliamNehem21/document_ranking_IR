Maunsell's substitution Oliver Bulleid trusted that there was little need to improve draughting on this arrangement. Nonetheless, reports of poor steaming with No.ÃÂ 792 "Sir Hervis de Revel" allowed him a chance to preliminary a LemaÃÂ®tre various stream blastpipe and wide-width stack on a Maunsell Arthur in 1940. This did not improve execution to the degree of No.ÃÂ 755 "The Red Knight". Under British Railways possession, the train was re-fitted with the Maunsell smokestack in March 1952 with no further issues revealed. In another wartime test, Bulleid fitted No.ÃÂ 783 "Sir Gillemere" with three slight "stovepipe" smokestacks in November 1940. These were set in a triangular arrangement to lessen perceivability of fumes from the air in light of assaults made by low-flying airplane on Southern Railway trains. The "stovepipes" were diminished to two, creating a savage fumes shoot that removed residue inside passages and under scaffolds. The test was stopped in February 1941 and the train re-fitted with a Maunsell King Arthur smokestack. The last examination was with sparkle capturing hardware in light of lineside fires brought about by low quality coal. Nos.ÃÂ 784 "Sir Nerovens" and 788 "Sir Urre of the Mount" were fitted with new wide-distance across smokestacks in late 1947. Test-trains indicated blended outcomes and the preliminaries were halted in 1951 after upgrades in coal quality and the fitting of inside smokebox sparkle arrestors.
