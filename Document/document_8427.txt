On February 18, 1799, Adams amazed numerous by naming ambassador William Vans Murray on a harmony mission to France. The choice was made without counseling his bureau or even Abigail, who regardless after knowing about it portrayed it as a "triumph." To pacify Republicans, he assigned Patrick Henry and Ellsworth to go with Murray and the Senate quickly affirmed them on March 3. Henry declined the selection and Adams picked William Richardson Davie to supplant him. Hamilton unequivocally condemned the choice, as did Adams' bureau individuals, who kept up successive correspondence with him. Adams again scrutinized the reliability of those men yet did not evacuate them. To the inconvenience of many, Adams spent an entire seven monthsÃ¢ÂÂ March to SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂ of 1799 in Peacefield, at last coming back to Trenton, where the legislature had set up impermanent quarters because of the yellow fever pestilence, after a letter touched base from Talleyrand affirming Gerry's explanation that American pastors would be gotten. Adams at that point chose to send the chiefs to France. Adams touched base back in Trenton on October 10. Not long after, Hamilton, in a break of military convention, arrived excluded at the city to talk with the president, asking him not to send the harmony magistrates but rather to align with Britain, which he saw to be the more grounded gathering, to reestablish the Bourbons to France. "I heard him with impeccable affableness, however never in my life did I hear a man talk progressively like a trick," Adams said. He viewed Hamilton's thought as illusory and outlandish. On November 15, the chiefs set sail for Paris.
