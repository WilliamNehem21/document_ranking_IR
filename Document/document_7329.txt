Against the pattern set by the Lotus 21 of every 1961, the BT19's suspension, which controls the overall movement of the skeleton and the wheels, is detachable all round. That is, the massive springs and dampers are mounted in the space between the haggles bodywork, where they meddle with the wind current and increment undesirable streamlined drag. Tauranac continued with this evidently moderate methodology dependent on wind burrow tests he had done in the mid 1960s, which showed that a progressively entangled inboard plan, with the springs and dampers hid under the bodywork, would give just a 2% improvement in drag. He made a decision about the additional time expected to set up an inboard structure at the circuit to exceed this little improvement. At the front the suspension comprises of unequal length, non-parallel twofold wishbones. The front uprights, the strong parts whereupon the haggles are mounted, were changed from the Alford and Alder units utilized on the British Triumph Herald cantina. The back suspension is shaped by a solitary top connection, a switched lower wishbone and two span poles finding cast magnesium combination uprights. Wheels were at first 13ÃÂ inches (330ÃÂ mm) in breadth, however before long moved up to at the back, later still 15ÃÂ in at the front also. These increments empowered the utilization of bigger, all the more dominant brakes. Steel circle brakes are utilized on every one of the four haggles of measurement for the littler haggles the bigger ones. The vehicle kept running on stepped Goodyear tires all through its hustling vocation.
