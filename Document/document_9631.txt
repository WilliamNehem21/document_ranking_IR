The framework utilizes a multi-work Doppler radar, which can be turned on and off by the tank authority. Related to radar input, an advanced PC checks a curve around the tank for dangers, and assesses which of the tank's 26 speedy activity shots it will discharge to capture the approaching risk. In choosing the shot to use for vanquishing the danger, the ballistic PC utilizes the data handled by the radar, including data, for example, flight parameters and speed. The PC has a response time of 0.05 seconds and ensures the tank over a 300-degree circular segment, all over however the back side of the turret. The framework connects with focuses inside of the vehicle it is shielding, and the ammo explodes at around from the risk. It will connect any danger moving toward the tank between the speeds of and , and can distinguish false targets, for example, active shots, flying creatures and little gauge projectiles. "Field" works amid the day and night, and the absence of electromagnetic obstruction enables the framework to be utilized by various vehicles as a group. The 27-volt framework requires roughly one kilowatt of intensity, and weighs around . "Field" expands a tank's likelihood of enduring a rocket-impelled projectile by between 1.5Ã¢ÂÂ multiple times.
