Pundits frequently applauded the exhibitions by Swank and Sevigny; Peter Travers said the pair "give exhibitions that consume in the memory", and The Film Stage named Swank's execution "one of the best" Best Actress Oscar-winning exhibitions. Diminish Stack of the "San Francisco Chronicle" praised the lead acting exhibitions of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, stating, "It might be the best-acted film of the year". Online film analyst James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four; he featured the exhibitions of Swank and Sevigny as the film's most prominent achievement and compared the film's force to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli composed that Swank "gives the execution of her vocation" and that "Sevigny's execution is more traditional than Swank's, however no less viable. She gives the offset to the tide of disdain that suffocates the last demonstration of the film." Emanuel Levy of "Assortment" called the acting "faultless" and presumed that the "amazingly cultivated" and "real" film could be "viewed as a "Dissident Without a Cause" for these socially differing and complex occasions, with the two loners establishing a variant of the James DeanÃ¢ÂÂNatalie Wood sentiment with most extreme conviction, looking, similar to their '50s partners, for affection, self-esteem and a spot to call home". Stephen Hunter of "The Washington Post" said the exhibitions are of such "glowing humankind that they make you extremely upset". "Debut" recorded Swank's execution as one of the "100 Greatest Performances of All Time". Owen Gleiberman of "Amusement Weekly" considered Swank a "disclosure" and stated, "before the end, her Brandon/Teena is past male or female. Maybe we were basically seeing the character's spirit, in the entirety of its longing and clashed magnificence."
