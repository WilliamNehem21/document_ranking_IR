Belet-Ekallim (Ninegal) was a prominent deity in Qatna; the inventories of gifts presented to the gods found in hall C of the palace show that she was a prominent element in the royal liturgy, where she was called the "lady of the palace" and "Belet Qatna", making her effectively the goddess of the city. However, no trace of a temple or shrine has been found in the building. The inventories also mention the "gods of the king"; it is debated whether this referred to deities or to royal ancestors. Jean BottÃ©ro identified the "gods of the king" with the sun god Å amaÅ¡, whom Akizzi called the "god of my father" in his letter to Akhenaten. Gregorio del Olmo Lete considered Å amaÅ¡ the god of Qatna's dynasty, but the "gods of the king" probably included other deities as well. Jean-Marie Durand considers Addu to be the god of the city based on a seal dating to IÅ¡á¸«i-Addu's reign describing Addu as such. Another indication of the deities worshiped in Qatna comes from the archive of Mari; the daughter of IÅ¡á¸«i-Add was devoted to the goddess Ishtar and Zimri-Lim once invited Amut-piÊ¾el II to Mari to take part in rituals for that goddess, indicating that the cult of Ishtar was prominent in Qatna.
