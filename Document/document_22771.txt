Hoult starred in a series of biographical and historical films in 2017; he said he preferred playing characters that might help him improve as an actor and that the "actors I look up to started doing their best work in their early 30s and I'll be hitting that ageÂ  ... I'm just trying to learn". He portrayed American author J. D. Salinger in Danny Strong's "Rebel in the Rye", which chronicles Salinger's life from his youth to the World War II era and the years preceding the publication of his debut novel, "The Catcher in the Rye". Hoult auditioned for the role because he was intrigued by the film's script and Salinger's enigmatic personality; "I didnât know he fought in the second world war and landed on D-Day:Â ... had intermittent PTSD or that he became interested in Vedanta philosophy and meditated and did yoga". To prepare for the role, Hoult read "The Catcher in the Rye" and biographies about Salinger. Hoult said the biggest challenge was to get a real understanding of Salinger's character; "everyone has an idea of [Salinger] in their mindÂ ... you're creating a character that people have very strong feelings about. You can't prove to be right or wrong through impressions." "Rebel in the Rye" opened to a poor response from film critics. Carson Lund of "Slant" was largely unimpressed by Hoult's "feeble" performance and his inability to "reinvest the character with the complexities lost in the storyâs programmatic telling". "RogerEbert.com"s Matt Fagerholm wrote that although Hoult was capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, he is never "quite believable as Salinger". Fagerholm ascribed the failure to the script, which left the character's key motivations "frustratingly muddled".
