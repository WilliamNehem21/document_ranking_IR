Hurricane Diane's path over the eastern United States brought heavy rainfall, fueled by unusually moist air resulting from abnormally high sea surface temperatures. The worst flooding was in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, southeastern New York, and southern New England. Of the 287Â stream gauges in the region, 129Â reported record levels during the course of the event. Many streams reported discharge rates of more than double the previous records. Most of the flooding occurred along small rivers that rose to flood stage within hours, largely impacting populated areas; there were around 30Â million people in the region affected by the floods. Overall, 813Â houses were destroyed, with 14,000 heavily damaged. The floods severed infrastructure and affected several summer camps. Damage to public utilities was estimated at $79Â million. Flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains, while destroyed crops cost an estimated $7Â million. Hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed, accounting for $82Â million in damage. Damage from Diane's winds were generally minor. The hurricane caused $754,706,000 in damage (1955Â USD), of which $600Â million was in New England, making it the costliest hurricane in American history at the time. Taking into account indirect losses, such as loss of wages and business earnings, Diane was described as "the first billion dollar hurricane." This contributed to 1955 being the costliest Atlantic hurricane season on record at the time. Overall, there were at least 184Â deaths, potentially as many as 200.
