"New York Dolls" in any case got across the board praise from contemporary analysts. In a rave survey for "NME", Nick Kent said the band's uncouth style of shake and roll was distinctively recorded by Rundgren on a collection that, other than Iggy and the Stooges' "Crude Power" (1973), filled in as the just a single "so far to completely characterize just precisely where 1970s shake ought to originate from". "Pant Press" originator and proofreader Ira Robbins saw "New York Dolls" as an inventive record, splendidly disordered, and all around delivered by Rundgren. Ellen Willis, composing for "The New Yorker", said it was by a long shot the year's most convincing hard shake collection and that in any event half of its tunes were quick works of art, especially "Identity Crisis" and "Rubbish", which she called "extraordinary". In "Newsday", Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as "the best hard musical gang in the nation and possibly the world at the present time", composing that their "uncommon virtuoso" was joining the clever songwriting insightful of mid 1960s prominent music with the anarchic sound recently 1960s substantial metal. He asserted the record's excited methodology, different feelings, and wild clamor passed on Manhattan's cruel, freak thrill superior to the Velvet Underground. "Moving Stone" pundit Tony Glover trusted the band's noteworthy live solid was generally saved on the collection, yet he was somewhat reproachful of generation thrives and overdubs, feeling they made a few verses vast and some ensembles excessively vibrant. In spite of the fact that he was shocked Rundgren's creation functioned admirably with the gathering's uncivilized sound on the vast majority of the melodies, Glover at last asked whether "the record alone will awe as much as observing them live (they're an exceedingly "watchable" gathering)."
