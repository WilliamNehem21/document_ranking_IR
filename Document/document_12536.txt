The species relating to "Deinosuchus" since the restoration of the nonexclusive name in 1979 have been customarily perceived as "D. rugosus" from Appalachia and the bigger "D. hatcheri/riograndensis" from Laramidia, described by contrasts of the state of their osteoderms and teeth. Notwithstanding, this view was not all around upheld and Schwimmer (2002) perceived only one species, "Deinosuchus rugosus", with the distinctions found between the two species clarified as the aftereffect of the bigger size of the western transform. This proposition was embraced by Lucas et al. (2006), yet was scrutinized by different creators and a SVP 2010 conceptual Schwinner detailed new fossils of examples from the two sides of the inside seaway that showed that the contrasts between the two transforms were not simply measure related, teeth from extensive eastern examples held the normal qualities of different examples of the area and osteoderms from little examples of the western transform were the same as those of huge ones, supporting the particular partition of the two transforms, "D. rugosus" and "D. hatcheri/riograndensis". In their outline of crocodyliform material from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, Irmis et al. (2013) noticed that "D. rugosus" is questionable because of its holotype teeth being undiagnostic, and suggested utilizing "Deinosuchus hatcheri" for "Deinosuchus" material from Laramidia, while focusing on that cranial "Deinosuchus" material from Appalachia has not been portrayed.
