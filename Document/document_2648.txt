To give the waste to the low-level sewers, in February 1864 Bazalgette started constructing three dikes along the shores of the Thames. On the northern side he fabricated the Victoria Embankment, which keeps running from Westminster to Blackfriars Bridge, and the Chelsea Embankment, running from Millbank to the Cadogan Pier at Chelsea. The southern side contains the Albert Embankment, from the Lambeth end of Westminster Bridge to Vauxhall. He ran the sewers along the banks of the Thames, developing dividers on the foreshore, running the sewer pipes inside and infilling around them. The works guaranteed over of land from the Thames; the Victoria Embankment had the additional advantage of alleviating the blockage on the previous streets among Westminster and the City of London. The expense of structure the dikes was evaluated at ÃÂ£1.71ÃÂ million, of which ÃÂ£450,000 was utilized for buying the fundamental stream front properties, which would in general be for light modern use. The Embankment venture was viewed as being broadly essential and, with the Queen unfit to go to in light of sickness, the Victoria Embankment was opened by the Prince of Wales in July 1870. The Albert Embankment had been finished in November 1869, while the Chelsea Embankment was opened in July 1874.
