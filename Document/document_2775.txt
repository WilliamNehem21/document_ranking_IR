In spite of the fact that the realized skins are generally white, contemporary delineations portray some blue people; others had a blend of white and blue quills. Their legs were red or yellow, yet the last shading may just be available on dried examples. The bill and frontal shield were red, and the iris was red or darker. As indicated by notes composed on an outline by an obscure craftsman (in the gathering of the craftsman Thomas Watling, incorrectly dated 1792), the chicks were dark and wound up pale blue dim and after that white as they developed. The Vienna example is unadulterated white, however the Liverpool example has yellowish reflections on its neck and bosom, blackish-blue quills dotted on the head (thought close to the upper surface of the shield) and neck, blue plumes on the bosom, and purplish-blue quills on the shoulders, back, scapular and lesser undercover plumes. A portion of the retrice plumes are purplish-darker, and a portion of the scapular quills and those on the mid-back are dingy darker at the base and dirty blue further up. The focal retrice quills are dirty dark colored and pale blue. This colouration demonstrates that the Liverpool example was a more youthful feathered creature than the Vienna example, and the last had achieved the last phase of development. Since the Liverpool example safeguards a portion of its unique shading, van Grouw and Hume had the capacity to recreate its common colouration before getting to be white. It varied from different swamphens in having blackish-blue legends, temple, crown, scruff and rear neck, purple-blue mantle, back, and wings, a darker backside and upper-tail secret plumes, and dim grayish-blue underparts.
