After three days Turpin, joined by similar men alongside William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, mercilessly assaulted a ranch in Marylebone. The assault got the group just shy of ÃÂ£90. The following day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of ÃÂ£50 in return for data prompting the conviction of the "few people" engaged with the two Woodford burglaries, and the thefts of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. On 11ÃÂ February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were secured. Two records of their catch exist. One cases that on their approach to loot the Lawrence family the posse had halted at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11ÃÂ February, while out strolling, the proprietor saw a gathering of ponies outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury. He perceived these steeds as those utilized by a similar gathering of men who had ceased at his alehouse under the steady gaze of the Lawrence assault, and required the ward constable. Another record asserts that two of the posse were spotted by a worker of Joseph Lawrence. In any case, the three, who were drinking with a lady (potentially Mary Brazier) were instantly captured and focused on jail. Wheeler, who may have been as youthful asÃÂ 15, immediately double-crossed his associates, and depictions of those yet to be caught were flowed in the press. In the "London Gazette", Turpin was portrayed as "Richard Turpin, a butcher in terms of professional career, is a tall crisp hued man, especially set apart with the little pox, around 26 years old, around five feet nine inches high, experienced some time prior in Whitechapel and did of late hotel some place about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue dim coat and a characteristic wig".
