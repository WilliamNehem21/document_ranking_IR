On January 10, 1825, Desha delegated four judges to the new court. He picked his Secretary of State, previous U.S. Representative William T. Barry, as boss equity. The other three individuals were Lexington legal advisor James Haggin, Circuit Judge John Trimble (sibling of Supreme Court Justice Robert Trimble), and Benjamin Patton. Of the new court Ã¢ÂÂ called by depreciators the "Desha court" Ã¢ÂÂ Barry "appears to have been the special case who had in a measure an even show in involvement, eminence, and capacity to rank as a legal scholar with the old-court judges", as per Stickles. Achilles Sneed, assistant of the Old Court, would not surrender the court's records to Francis P. Blair, representative of the New Court, so Blair took the records from Sneed's office by power, and Sneed was fined 10 pounds for scorn of court due to his refusal to participate. The Old Court kept on hearing cases in a Frankfort church, while the New Court involved the official court chambers. Neither perceived the other, and both professed to be the real court after all other options have run out in the state. A large portion of the state's legal counselors and judges were supporters of the Old Court and kept on rehearsing before them and comply with their orders, yet others recognized the New Court as genuine.
