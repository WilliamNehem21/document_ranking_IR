In 1918, while instructing in Geneva, Szigeti met and began to look all starry eyed at Wanda Ostrowska. She was conceived in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a completing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska chose to get hitched, however because of the violent political circumstance in Europe, numerous surprising bureaucratic obstructions were hurled in their way. The principal issue was the inconceivability of reaching Ostrowska's family, and the couple were compelled to proceed without parental assent, with the consent just of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the completing school. Further bureaucratic snares undermined the youthful couple's expectations, however in the long run the authorities capable conceded them an administration to wed. Szigeti reviews in his diaries the expressions of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the basic minute: Let us not, in the event that we can keep away from it, succumb to the dead letter of the law. I would prefer not to delay the joy of these two youths on the off chance that we can support it. The sum total of what laws have been turned and tormented out of similarity to law, what with war and upsets. For once we should wander aimlessly one for a decent aim, yes?
