The essential unit of the military, the demi-detachment, blended the men of the old armed force with the enlisted people from the "levee as a group." Ideally, it was intended to incorporate the ordinary infantry acquired from the old Royal regiments of the King, who were generally all around prepared and prepared, wearing white regalia and wearing tarleton protective caps, with the national gatekeeper units, who were less very much prepared or prepared, with blue outfits, and the "fÃÂ©dÃÂ©rÃÂ©" volunteer brigades, who were inadequately prepared and prepared, with no uniform other than a red phrygian top and a tricolor rosette. In 1794, the correct flank of the Armies of the Center, later called the Army of the Moselle, the whole of the Armies of the North and the Ardennes shaped the Army of the Sambre and Meuse, on 29 June 1794. The rest of the units of the previous Army of the Center and the Army of the Rhine joined at first on 29 November 1794 and formally on 20 April 1795, under order of General Jean-Charles Pichegru as the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. These were the French armed forces associated with the triumphs at Fleurus and the Lowlands, however the quality of the units had been upgraded by untrained recruits.
