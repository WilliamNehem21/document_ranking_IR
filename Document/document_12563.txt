Palsgraf got suit against the railroad the Supreme Court of New York, Kings County, a preliminary dimension court, in Brooklyn on October 2, 1924. The request was served the next month, and the litigant recorded its answer on December 3. The case was heard on May 24 and 25, 1927, with Justice Burt Jay Humphrey directing. Humphrey had served for more than twenty years on the region court in Queens before surprisingly being assigned for race to the Supreme Court in 1925; he was noted for his obliging and cordial way. Manhattan legal counselors attempted the Brooklyn case: Matthew W. Wood, who worked from 233 Broadway (the Woolworth Building) spoke to Palsgraf, while Joseph F. Keany, whose office was at Pennsylvania Station, was for the railroad, alongside William McNamara. Wood was an accomplished solo expert with two degrees from Ivy League schools; Keany had headed the LIRR's legitimate division for a long timeÃ¢ÂÂMcNamara, who attempted the case, was one of the office's lesser legal counselors, who had progressed from representative to direct after graduation from graduate school. At preliminary, Palsgraf affirmed that she had been hit in the side by the scale, and had been treated at the scene, and afterward took a cab home. She vouched for trembling then for a few days, and afterward the stammering began. Her wellbeing constrained her to surrender her work in mid-1926. Wood called Herbert Gerhardt, an etcher, who had seen the man with the bundle hustle towards the train, and whose spouse had been hit in the stomach in the man's surge. He affirmed that the scale had been "blown ideal to pieces".
