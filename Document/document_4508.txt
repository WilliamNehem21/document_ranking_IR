Like his legends Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac endeavors in "Louis Lambert" to develop a feasible hypothesis to bind together soul and matter. Youthful Lambert endeavors this objective in his "TraitÃÂ© de la VolontÃÂ©", which Ã¢ÂÂ having been seized by an educator Ã¢ÂÂ is portrayed by the narrator:The word Will he used to connoteÃÂ ... the mass of intensity by which man can replicate, outside himself, the activities establishing his outer life... The word Mind, or Thought, which he viewed as the quintessential result of the Will, likewise spoke to the medium in which the thoughts begin to which thought gives substance... In this way the Will and the Mind were the two creating powers; the Volition and the Idea were the two items. Volition, he thought, was the Idea developed from the theoretical state to a solid state, from its generative liquid to a strong articulation... As indicated by him, the Mind and Ideas are the movement and the result of our internal association, similarly as the Will and Volition are of our outer action. He gave the Will priority over the Mind.The investigation of human will and thought is connected to Balzac's enthusiasm for Franz Mesmer, who hypothesized the hypothesis of creature attraction, a power streaming among people. The storyteller conjures Mesmer twice in the content, and depicts a segment of the "TraitÃÂ© de la VolontÃÂ©" which mirrors the creature attractive hypothesis.
