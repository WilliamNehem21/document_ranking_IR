While the Iwasa Unit arrived at its attack position on 8Â March, its assault on the American perimeter was delayed until the next day. Hill 700, in the 37thÂ Division's sector, was held by the 2nd and 3rdÂ Battalions of the U.S. Army's 145th Infantry Regiment. Very steep, with a deep saddle between two knolls, Hill 700 proved difficult to both defend and to attack. For several days prior to the attack there had been clashes between U.S. and Japanese patrols in the front of the position, and Japanese patrols had been engaged in wire cutting around the perimeter. Several small skirmishes were fought between these units and elements of the Japanese 23rdÂ Infantry Regiment on 8Â March, and the 37thÂ Division's artillery bombarded areas from where the Japanese could potentially launch an attack on the 2ndÂ Battalion, 145thÂ Infantry. The 23rdÂ Infantry Regiment belatedly began to attack just after midnight on 9Â March amidst heavy rain, but failed to penetrate far into the American defenses. After daybreak on 9Â March, elements of the 1st and 2ndÂ Battalions of the 145thÂ Infantry Regiment counterattacked the Japanese, and regained most of the terrain which had been lost. Two M3 Stuart tanks from the 754thÂ Tank Battalion supported the attack but proved ineffective due to the steep terrain. Meanwhile, the Japanese took advantage of the terrain to bring machine gun and mortar fire down on the U.S. supply route dubbed McClelland Road. Two American destroyers provided fire support for the U.S. Army forces, and fired a total of 400 rounds during the day. As night fell, forward movement largely ceased. Both sides maintained a defensive posture throughout the night, exchanging small arms and indirect fire.
