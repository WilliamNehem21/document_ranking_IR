The third demonstration starts on the upper floor of the house, where a conceal man is found in the already shrouded room taking a cash sack from a safe. At the point when Dale finds the room, the man escapes, abandoning her and the cash bolted inside. The others discover her there, oblivious. Anderson returns and blames Wells for taking the cash and executing Richard. Cornelia starts to introduce an elective hypothesis, yet is hindered when the obscure man comes upstairs and Anderson gets some information about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the rooftop, and the greater part of the gathering leaves to search for him. Cornelia utilizes the diversion to tell Dale, Jack and the obscure man that she supposes the cash is still in the room. When they look for the cash, Jack finds the assemblage of Courtleigh Fleming, who was murdered as of late. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack contend about what has occurred, the obscure man bolts the entryway and requests them to be peaceful. At the point when the covered man sneaks in through a window, the obscure man captures him and uncovers that he, the obscure man, is the genuine Detective Anderson; the Bat (the veiled man) had claimed to be Anderson.
