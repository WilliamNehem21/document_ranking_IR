Most Egyptian gods speak to common or social marvels. The divine beings were by and large said to be inherent in these wondersÃ¢ÂÂto be available inside nature. The sorts of wonders they spoke to incorporate physical places and articles just as conceptual ideas and powers. The god Shu was the reverence of all the world's air; the goddess Meretseger directed a constrained area of the earth, the Theban Necropolis; and the god Sia embodied the theoretical idea of recognition.

For example, Khnum was the divine force of Elephantine Island amidst the Nile, the waterway that was fundamental to Egyptian human advancement. He was credited with creating the yearly Nile flood that treated the country's farmland. Maybe as an outgrowth of this nurturing capacity, he was said to make every living thing, forming their bodies on a potter's wheel. Divine beings could have a similar job in nature; Ra, Atum, Khepri, Horus, and different gods went about as sun divine beings. In spite of their assorted capacities, most divine beings shared an all-encompassing job practically speaking: keeping up "maat", the general request that was a focal guideline of Egyptian religion and was itself embodied as a goddess. However, a few divinities spoke to interruption to "maat". Most conspicuously, Apep was the power of mayhem, continually taking steps to demolish the request of the universe, and Set was an undecided individual from awesome society who could both battle issue and instigate it.
