Development proceeded with the issuing of a $6.55ÃÂ million contract (about $ in dollars) to extend a segment of I-8 through Alpine, from Harbison Canyon to east of West Victoria Drive, and to start development in April or May 1967, to be finished in 1969. This would leave just a stretch of I-8 that was not at turnpike guidelines. As the procedure proceeded, worries about expanded brown haze from the extra traffic were brought up in October 1967. A segment toward the east of Alpine was planned to have offering opened in November of that year, and was to be done in 1968; this would create a ceaseless expressway from San Diego toward the eastern end of this course. Both of these activities were in progress by May 1968. An extra contract was given out for $7.8ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) in August to proceed with the expressway east from Alpine Street to Japatul Valley Road; this would bring the interstate close Descanso Junction. Generally 5.5ÃÂ million cubic yards of earth and shake were to be produced by each of the three of these development ventures, since half of a mountain would need to be expelled with a million pounds of explosive. The third venture was worked close to the site of a deserted endeavor to fabricate a passage for the old parkway after World War II, which turned out to be excessively costly.
