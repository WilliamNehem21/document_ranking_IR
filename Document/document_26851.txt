Around this time a change had come in the governance of the Mughal Province of Sira to the north and northeast of Mysore. (See .) In 1713, the province was split into a "payanghat" jurisdiction with capital at Arcot and governed by a newly styled Nawab of Arcot, and a "balaghat" jurisdiction with capital at Sira, and governed by an also newly styled Nawab of Sira. That same year, the military governor of the old province, Sadat-ulla Khan, was made the new Nawab of Arcot, and another official, Amin Khan, was appointed Nawab of Sira; Since Mysore remained a formal tributary state of Sira, this division, and the resulting loss of revenue from the rich "MaidÄn" plain of Mysore, provoked Sadat-ulla Khan's displeasure. In collusion with the rulers of Kadapa, Kurnool, and Savanur and the Maratha Raja of Gutti, he decided to march against Dodda KrishnarajaÂ I. The Nawab of Sira, anxious to preempt the coalition's action, hit upon a similar plan for reaching the Mysore capital, Seringapatam. In the end, both Nawabsâof Arcot and Siraâsettled upon a joint invasion led by the former. Dodda Krishnaraja, for his part, was able to "buy off this formidable confederacy" by offering a tribute of Rs. 10Â million (10Â million). Although avoiding bloodshed, the outcome made Mysore vulnerable to similar future claims, which were made successfully two years later by Maratha raiders who appeared in the Mysore capital. The resulting depletion of the Mysore treasury led Mysore to attack and absorb the poligar chiefdom of Magadi to its north. (See .)
