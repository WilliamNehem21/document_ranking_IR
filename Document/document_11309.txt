Back in MopÃÂ¡n, AmÃÂ©squeta had gotten extra supplies and chosen to make up for lost time with his development party. He left MopÃÂ¡n on 10 March 1696 with monk AgustÃÂ­n Cano and around 10 fighters. He touched base at Chakal seven days after the fact yet there was still no word from DÃÂ­az or AjKÃÂ¼ixaw. On 20 March AmÃÂ©squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' provisions to discover DÃÂ­az's gathering, whom he expected would be adjacent. Following two days going in extreme warmth they got together with some Verapaz doormen that DÃÂ­az had deserted. They pursued DÃÂ­az's trail to the shore of Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡ close to the Itza capital. As they explored along the south shore they were shadowed by around 30 Itza kayaks, and more Itzas drawn closer via land yet kept a sheltered separation. There were ample signs that DÃÂ­az's gathering had passed that way, and AmÃÂ©squeta expected that they had crossed to NojpetÃÂ©n. He composed a letter to DÃÂ­az, which was passed to an Itza passerby who showed he would convey it. Different Itzas now moved toward the gathering, including an aristocrat who traded endowments with AmÃÂ©squeta. Amid different endeavors at correspondence to check DÃÂ­az's whereabouts the Itza ended up disturbed and reacted furiously, albeit nobody in the Spanish party could comprehend the Itza language. The Itzas showed that the Spanish ought to continue to the lakeshore along a tight way and leave in the little kayaks that were positioned adjacent. One of AmÃÂ©squeta's officers perceived an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had filled in as a fighter in DÃÂ­az's first undertaking and imagined that the Mopan was attempting to let him know not to confide in the Itzas.
