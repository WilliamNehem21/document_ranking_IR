In "Conclusive Fantasy XIII", Lightning, joined by Sazh Katzroy, achieves Anima alongside Snow, Hope and Oerba Dia Vanille, two enduring Purge ousts. When they discover Serah, she swings to gem. At that point Lightning and the gathering battle Anima and are set apart as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's primary military power, crushes Anima. Suspicious of Snow's purpose to spare her sister, Lightning relinquishes him and Serah, both of whom are then safeguarded by Oerba Yun Fang and a maverick Cocoon military power called the Cavalry. Part up from Sazh and Vanille, Lightning winds up going with Hope. Amid their time together, Lightning coincidentally brings Odin and unconsciously bolsters Hope's arrangement to kill Snow as she secures and tutors him. All through the diversion, Lightning battles to manage her temperament as a l'Cie, her annoyance at being made Cocoon's foe, and her blame at doubting Serah's story. In the wake of defeating these issues, she recognizes Snow's association with Serah and his confidence that they will reestablish her. When they execute the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to spare Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the gathering aside from Vanille and Fang are permitted to come back to their ordinary lives as Vanille and Fang structure a precious stone column to prevent Cocoon from slamming into Gran Pulse.
