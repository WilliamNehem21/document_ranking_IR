In the late 1750s, Adams went gaga for Hannah Quincy; while they were separated from everyone else, he was ready to propose however was hindered by companions, and the minute was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old Abigail Smith through his companion Richard Cranch, who was pursuing Abigail's more established sister. Adams at first was not inspired with Abigail and her two sisters, composing that they were not "affectionate, nor plain, nor real to life." In time they developed close and were hitched on October 25, 1764, in spite of the restriction of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared an affection for books and related identities that demonstrated fair in their recognition and analysis of one another. After his dad's demise in 1761, Adams had acquired a homestead and a house where they lived until 1783. John and Abigail had six kids: Abigail "Nabby" in 1765, future president John Quincy Adams in 1767, Susanna in 1768, Charles in 1770, Thomas in 1772, and Elizabeth in 1777. Susanna kicked the bucket when she was one year old, while Elizabeth was stillborn. Each of the three of his children progressed toward becoming legal counselors; Charles and Thomas were ineffective, moved toward becoming heavy drinkers, and passed on youthful, while John Quincy exceeded expectations and propelled a profession in legislative issues. Adams' works are without his sentiments about the children's destinies.
