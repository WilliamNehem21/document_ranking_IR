The end result for Sherwood after her dodging is hazy the same number of court records have been lost. She served an obscure time in the correctional facility by Lynnhaven Parish Church, maybe up to seven years and nine months. She was requested to be confined "to be conveyed to a future preliminary", however no record of another preliminary exists, so it is conceivable the charge was expelled eventually. On September 1, 1708, she was requested to pay Christopher Cocke of tobacco for a reason not showed in enduring records, however there is no notice of the installment. She seems to have been discharged some time in or before 1714, since in that year she made good on back regulatory expenses on her propertyÃ¢ÂÂwhich Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood helped her to recuperate from Princess Anne CountyÃ¢ÂÂon the banks of Muddy Creek off what is currently Muddy Creek Road. She carried on with an amazing rest discreetly until her passing in 1740, matured around 80. She is accepted to have kicked the bucket in August or September 1740. Her will was demonstrated on October 1, 1740; it noticed that she was a widow. She left five shillings each to her children James and Richard and everything else to her oldest child John.
