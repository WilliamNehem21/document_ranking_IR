In 1845, beginner geologists William Guybon Atherstone and Andrew Geddes Bain found a few fossils close Dassieklip, Cape Province, in the Bushmans River Valley. This was the main dinosaur find in the majority of the Southern Hemisphere and Africa. In 1849 and 1853, Bain sent a portion of the fossils to scientist Richard Owen for distinguishing proof. Among them was an upper jaw Bain alluded to as the "Cape "Iguanodon"", so the site was named "Iguanodonhoek". Atherstone distributed a short paper about the revelation in 1857, however bemoaned in 1871 that it had so far gotten no consideration in London. Just in 1876 were a progression of examples from the gathering named by Owen as "Anthodon serrarius", putting together the nonexclusive name with respect to the likeness of the teeth to a blossom. The incomplete holotype skull BMNH 47337, the left jaw BMNH 47338, the grid BMNH 47338 including bone pieces and impressions of the front skull, and the vertebrae BMNH 47337a were altogether alloted to "Anthodon." In 1882, Othniel Charles Marsh doled out "Anthodon" to Stegosauridae dependent on BMNH 47338, and in 1890, Richard Lydekker found that despite the fact that "Anthodon" was a pareiasaur, its teeth were like those of the Stegosauridae. Lydekker in 1890 additionally rectified a slip-up of Owen, who had inaccurately abridged all the material as originating from a solitary territory, while there was independent material from two unmistakably particular territories.
