The York City War Memorial is a First World War dedication structured by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated in York in the north of England. Proposition for recognizing York's war dead began in 1919 yet demonstrated dubious. Beginning talks concentrated on whether a commemoration ought to be a landmark or should take on some utilitarian reason. A few useful proposition were inspected until an open gathering in January 1920 selected a landmark. The city engineer delivered a cost gauge and the war remembrance advisory group connected with Lutyens, who had as of late been charged by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to structure their own war dedication, likewise to be sited in York. Lutyens' first plan was affirmed, yet debate wrapped recommendations for both the city's and the NER's commemorations. Individuals from the neighborhood network wound up worried that the dedications as arranged were not with regards to York's current design, particularly as both were in nearness to the old city dividers, and that the NER's commemoration would eclipse the city's. Proceeded with open restriction constrained the board to forsake the proposed site for one on Leeman Road, simply outside the dividers, and Lutyens presented another plan of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the area. This was downsized to the cross alone because of absence of assets.
