Be that as it may, the inside structure of Norfolk House was to characterize the London town house for the following century. The floor plan depended on an adjustment of one of the optional wings he had worked at Holkham Hall. A circuit of banquet halls fixated on a terrific staircase, with the staircase corridor supplanting the Italian conventional inward yard or two-story lobby. This course of action of salons enabled visitors everywhere gatherings to flow, having been gotten at the leader of the staircase, without backtracking on arriving visitors. The second preferred standpoint was that while each room approached the following, it likewise approached the focal stairs, subsequently enabling just a couple of rooms to be utilized at once for littler capacities. Beforehand, visitors in London houses had needed to achieve the foremost salon through a long enfilade of minor banquet halls. In this square and reduced way, Brettingham verged on reproducing the format of a unique Palladian Villa. He changed what Andrea Palladio had imagined as a nation retreat into a London manor fitting for the way of life of the British privileged, with its inversion of the standard Italian local example of an extensive "palazzo" nearby, and a littler estate in the nation. As occurred so frequently in Brettingham's vocation, Robert Adam later built up this plan idea further, and was credited with its prosperity. In any case, Brettingham's arrangement for Norfolk House was to fill in as the model for some London chateaus throughout the following couple of decades.
