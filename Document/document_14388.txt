Other than verbal exchange and feelings in letters, there were just a couple of distributed contemporary surveys. The essayist and columnist John Stoddart (1773Ã¢ÂÂ 1856), in a survey of "Expressive Ballads", depicted "Unusual fits" and "She abided" as "the most solitary examples of unpretending, yet overwhelming emotion". A mysterious audit of "Sonnets in Two Volumes" in 1807 had a more negative feeling about "I travell'd": "Another string of level lines about Lucy is prevailing by a tribute to Duty". Faultfinder Francis Jeffrey (1773Ã¢ÂÂ 1850) guaranteed that, in "Unusual fits", "Mr Wordsworth, in any case, has thought fit to form a piece, showing this overflowing subject by one single idea. A darling jogs away to see his fancy woman one fine night, gazing right at the moon: when he goes to her entryway, 'O benevolence! to myself I cried,/If Lucy ought to be dead!' And there the sonnet closes!" On "A sleep did my soul seal", Wordsworth's companion Thomas Powell composed that the lyric "remains independent from anyone else, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the entrance of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a spin-off of the other profound sonnets that go before it, and is around one Lucy, who is dead. From the chapter by chapter list, nonetheless, we are educated by the creator that it is around 'A Slumber;' for this is the real title which he has stooped to offer it, to put us out of torment regarding what it is about."
