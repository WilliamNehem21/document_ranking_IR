At their first meeting together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a "marginally fabricated, practically slight, peaceful and segregated 18-year-old ... boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly obliging mien. He was most thankful and appreciative that I had embraced his protection." When Nosanchuk got some information about the occasions of 25 June, Lamb ended up reluctant, incoherent and befuddled in his discussion; "he appeared to see these occasions as though he was not by any stretch of the imagination associated with them," Nosanchuk reviewed. Sheep said that in spite of the fact that he had a black out memory of what had occurred, he couldn't recall taking the shotgun, stacking it or shooting anyone. He said that before amid the evening on 25 June he had watched a film on TV in which someone had shot and executed a few people, however did not clarify whether he had been re-instituting this. The legal counselor at that point requested that Lamb talk about his own experience, adolescence and family. The 18-year-old was hesitant to do as such and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the kid appeared to be candidly separated from the relatives and occasions he depicted.
