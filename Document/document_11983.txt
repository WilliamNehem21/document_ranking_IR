A NOC with a competitor in the best 100 at 31 May 2008 got a spot, which was taken from the nations positioned 17Ã¢ÂÂ 24 in turned around request, gave that these competitors qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings. Furthermore, three spots were accessible at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; Gu Sun-Geun, Hae Ok-Jeong and Thatsani Wichana verified Olympic capability for their NOCs along these lines, however just the first was picked by her national board of trustees to contend. The greatest quantity of the occasion was set at 67 cyclists, and starting at 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified along these lines. In spite of the fact that the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were permitted to enter three cyclists, they just entered two.

Just 66 of the 67 participants started the race, as MarÃÂ­a Isabel Moreno of Spain left the nation days sooner in the wake of coming up short a medication test.
