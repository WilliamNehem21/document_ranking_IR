In the 2017 "History of Digital Games", author Andrew Williams claims that "Vorticons" "signaled a new direction for computer games in general", as well as setting a tone of gameplay mechanics for future id games, by introducing a sense of "effortless movement" as players explored through large open spaces instead of disconnected screens like prior platforming computer games. In the summer of 1991, id hosted a seminar for game developers with the intention of licensing the "Commander Keen" engine; they did so, forming the spiritual predecessor to both QuakeCon and id's standard of licensing their game engines. Id Software also produced several more games in the "Commander Keen" series; the first of these, "Commander Keen in Keen Dreams", was published in 1991 through their agreement with Softdisk. "Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy", composed of the episodes "Secret of the Oracle" and "The Armageddon Machine", was published through Apogee in December 1991, and the final id-developed "Keen" game, "Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter", was published through FormGen around the same time. Another trilogy of episodes, titled "The Universe Is Toast!", was planned for December 1992, but was cancelled after the success of id's "Wolfenstein 3D" and development focus on "Doom". A final "Keen" game, "Commander Keen", was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision.
