In view of the issues he found with the head-butting speculation, Carpenter rather recommended the arches were adjustments for flank-butting (as found in some expansive African warm blooded animals); he envisioned that two creatures would stand parallel, confronting one another or a similar course, and hard impacts to the side of the rival. The generally expansive body width of pachycephalosaurs may thus have served to shield indispensable organs from mischief amid flank-butting. It is conceivable that "Stegoceras" and comparative pachycephalosaurs would have conveyed the blows with a development of the neck from the side and a revolution of the head. The upper sides of the arch have the best surface region, and may have been the purpose of effect. The thickness of the vault would have expanded the power behind a hit to the sides, and this would guarantee that the adversary felt the power of the effect, without being truly harmed. The bone edge over the circle may have secured the assailant's eye when making a blow. Craftsman proposed that the pachycephalosaurs would have first occupied with risk show by bouncing and displaying their heads to demonstrate the span of their vaults (terrorizing), and from that point conveyed hits to one another, until one adversary flagged accommodation.
