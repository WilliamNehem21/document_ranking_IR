Like "Robin", the "Distrustful Android" video is attracted a shortsighted style that accentuates striking hues and clear, solid lines. It highlights Robin and his companion Benjamin wandering into the world, running into hopeless EU delegates, harassing bar supporters, a whore, two kissing leathermen, a medication fiend, unhinged businesspeople, mermaids and a blessed messenger who plays table tennis with Robin. The band shows up in appearance at a bar, where they are appeared while watching a man with a head leaving his hip twirling on their table. In any case, in this appearance just the variants of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood take after themselves; O'Brien said "On the off chance that you solidify outline it on the video, the person with the five strands of hair slicked back, that is Colin. It looks not at all like him." Colin Greenwood said "there was no chance that we could show up in it to perform in it since that would be so Spinal Tap" and that having activitys that did not take after the band individuals enabled the video to be "wound and brilliant which is the manner by which the melody is at any rate". Yorke was at last satisfied with the video, saying that it "is extremely about the brutality around [Robin], which is actually similar to the tune. Not a similar explicit viciousness as in the verses, yet everything going on around him is profoundly disturbing and fierce, however he's simply drinking himself into blankness. He's there, however he's not there. That is the reason it works. What's more, that is the reason it does my head in each time I see it."
