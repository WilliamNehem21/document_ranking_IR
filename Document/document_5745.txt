In light of the risk of socialist Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 stream contenders, No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron was pulled back to Iwakuni in April 1951, to re-outfit with Gloster Meteors. Four Royal Air Force officers with Meteor experience were supported to No.ÃÂ 91 Wing to help with preparing. The squadron came back to activity with its new flying machine on 29ÃÂ July, working out of Kimpo, South Korea. The Mustangs had been very successful in close help, yet No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron's principle job in the RAAF was block attempt, and it was normal that with the Meteor it could again concentrate on contender obligations. As indicated by the official history of Australia in the Korean War, the unit demonstrated its esteem carefully just as operationally: having been one of the main UN squadrons to go vigorously, it included 33% of the fly contender constrain in the last piece of 1951, when conflicts in "MiG Alley" were at their tallness. In any case, dogfights among Meteors and MiGs that August persuaded the new boss, Wing Commander Gordon Steege, that the Australian planes were outmatched, and Fifth Air Force consented to remove them from a hostile aerial battle job for escort obligations and neighborhood air protection. The squadron's misfortune rate before the year's over was one of every four slaughtered or caught.
