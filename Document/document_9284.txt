Procellariids show large amounts of philopatry, displaying both natal philopatry and site devotion. Natal philopatry, the inclination of a fledgling to breed near where it brought forth, is solid among all the Procellariiformes. The proof for natal philopatry originates from a few sources, not the least of which is the presence of a few procellariid animal groups that are endemic to a solitary island. The investigation of mitochondrial DNA additionally gives proof of limited quality stream between various settlements, and has been utilized to indicate philopatry in pixie prions. Winged creature ringing likewise gives convincing proof of philopatry; an investigation of Cory's shearwaters settling close Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that came back to breed at their natal settlement really reared in the tunnel they were brought up in. This propensity towards philopatry is more grounded in certain species than others, and a few species promptly prospect potential new province locales and colonize them. It is estimated that there is an expense to scattering to another site, the shot of not finding a mate of similar animal categories, that chooses against it for rarer species, though there is most likely favorable position to dispersal for species that have state destinations that change drastically amid times of frigid development or retreat. There are additionally contrasts in the propensity to scatter dependent on sex, with females being bound to breed far from the natal site.
