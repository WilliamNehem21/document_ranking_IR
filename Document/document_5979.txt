In January 1946, Boucher and McComas went to New York and met with Spivak, who let them know later in the year that he needed to proceed. At Spivak's solicitation they started gaining material for the new magazine, including another story by Raymond Chandler, and reproduce rights to stories by H.P. Lovecraft, John Dickson Carr, and Robert Bloch. Spivak at first arranged the principal issue (for which Boucher and McComas were proposing the title "Dream and Horror") for mid 1947, yet over and again postponed the dispatch as a result of poor newspaper kiosk offers of summary magazines. He additionally recommended that it ought to be estimated at 35 pennies an issue, which was higher than the first arrangement, to give a money related cushion against poor deals. In May 1949 Spivak recommended another title, "The Magazine of Fantasy", and in August an official statement declared that the magazine would show up in October. On October 6, 1949, Spivak, Boucher and McComas held a lunch get-together at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City to honor the 100th commemoration of the passing of Edgar Allan Poe and to dispatch "another dream treasury periodical". Invitees included Carr, Basil Rathbone, and Boris Karloff.
