Regardless of its achievements in Europe "A Child of Our Time" did not achieve the United States until 1965, when it was performed amid the Aspen Music Festival, with the arranger present. In his journals Tippett makes reference to another execution on that American visit, at a ladies' school in Baltimore, in which the male theme and soloists were dark Catholic ordinands from a nearby theological college. The main critical American introductions of the work came 10 years after the fact: at Cleveland in 1977 where Prince Charles, who was visiting, deferred his takeoff with the goal that he could visit, and at Carnegie Hall, New York, where Colin Davis directed the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Exploring this execution for "The New York Times", Donal Henahan was unconvinced that the work's "truthfulness and blameless goals add[ed] up to vital music". The spirituals were sung with energy and enthusiasm, however the rest was "reminiscent of a well-known devout lesson" in which the words were just discontinuously clear. Then, the work had accomplished its African presentation, where in 1975 Tippett watched an act with an extemporized symphony which fused the Zambian Police Band. The Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, was available, and engaged the author a while later.
