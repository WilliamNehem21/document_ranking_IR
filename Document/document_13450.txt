The fourth stage traverses the Pleistocene and Holocene and started with the emplacement of the Churilinco flotsam and jetsam torrential slide, which covers a surface of . This torrential slide was shaped by the breakdown of the more seasoned structure somewhere in the range of 450,000 and 430,000 years prior; no doubt the breakdown occurred after aqueous change had debilitated the building. The Tajane unit was emplaced between 430,000Ã¢ÂÂ 25,000 years prior on the south-southwestern inclines, covering a zone of . It comprises of thick magma streams, some magma arches on the western flank, a garbage torrential slide on the southern flank and two fanatics of pyroclastic streams on the southern and southwestern flank. Somewhere in the range of 25,000 and 9,000 years prior the Socapave unit was emplaced; it comprises of more magma vaults on the western edge of Taapaca and another flotsam and jetsam torrential slide, which cuts into these arches. This torrential slide covers a territory of to a separation of and was evidently hot when it was emplaced. This breakdown was activated by the improvement of a cryptodome inside the fountain of liquid magma, and Putre is built on the torrential slide store just as on Tajane, Socapave and Holocene pyroclastic streams. A pyroclastic ejection happened, filling in holes in the Socapave trash torrential slide store and emplacing progressively material on the southern aficionado of the Tajane unit.
