"Stegoceras" had teeth that were heterodont (separated) and (set in attachments). It had peripheral columns of generally little teeth, and the lines did not frame a straight front line. The teeth were set at a slant along the length of the jaws, and covered each other marginally from front to back. On each side, the most total example (UALVP 2) had three teeth in the premaxilla, sixteen in the maxilla (both piece of the upper jaw), and seventeen in the dentary of the lower jaw. The teeth in the premaxilla were isolated from those behind in the maxilla by a short diastema (space), and the two columns in the premaxilla were isolated by a toothless hole at the front. The teeth in the front piece of the upper jaw (premaxilla) and front lower jaw were comparative; these had taller, progressively pointed and recurved crowns, and a "heel" at the back. The front teeth in the lower jaw were bigger than those of the upper jaw. The front edges of the crowns bore eight denticles (serrations), and the back edge bore nine to eleven. The teeth in the back of the upper (maxilla) and lower jaw were triangular in side view and packed in front view. They had long roots that were oval in segment, and the crowns had a set apart at their bases. The denticles here were packed and coordinated towards the highest point of the crowns. Both the external and inward side of the tooth crowns bore veneer, and the two sides were partitioned vertically by an edge. Each edge had around seven or eight denticles, with the front edge as a rule having the most.
