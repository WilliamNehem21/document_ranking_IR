Napoleon I of France proclaimed himself First Consul of the French Republic on November 10, 1799, and delegated himself Emperor in 1804. Since Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, the nation was politically and deliberately imperative to French interests. The dominant Spanish sovereign, CharlesÃÂ IV, was globally viewed as insufficient. Indeed, even in his own court he was viewed as an "idiot lord who repudiates thinks about the fulfillment of chasing", and a cuckold unfit to control his vigorous spouse, Maria Luisa of Parma. Napoleon exploited the powerless lord by recommending the two countries overcome and separate Portugal, with France and Spain each taking 33% of the crown jewels, and the last third heading off to the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, alongside the title "Ruler of the Algarve". Godoy was tempted, and acknowledged the French offer. He flopped, nonetheless, to get a handle on Napoleon's actual goals, and was ignorant that his new partner and co-sovereign, the previous ruler's child FerdinandÃÂ VII of Spain, was utilizing the attack just as a ploy to catch the Spanish parliament and position of royalty. Ferdinand proposed not just that Godoy be slaughtered amid the approaching force battle, yet in addition that the lives of his own folks be yielded.
