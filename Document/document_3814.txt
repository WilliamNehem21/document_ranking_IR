Researchers have examined the attributes of cirrus utilizing a few distinct strategies. One, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gives exceedingly exact data on the cloud's elevation, length, and width. Inflatable conveyed hygrometers give data on the mugginess of the cirrus cloud however are not sufficiently exact to quantify the profundity of the cloud. Radar units give data on the elevations and thicknesses of cirrus mists. Another information source is satellite estimations from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is caught up in the environment, and on the off chance that it is assimilated at cirrus elevations, at that point it is accepted that there are cirrus mists in that area. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) MODerate goals Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) likewise gives data on the cirrus overcast spread by estimating reflected infrared radiation of different explicit frequencies amid the day. Amid the night, it decides cirrus spread by distinguishing the Earth's infrared discharges. The cloud mirrors this radiation back to the ground, along these lines empowering satellites to see the "shadow" it throws into space. Visual perceptions from air ship or the ground give extra data about cirrus mists.
