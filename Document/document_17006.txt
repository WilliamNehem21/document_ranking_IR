In March 2018, the band announced they would play the album in full for the first time. The tour would take place in October and November and would travel to Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin plus dates in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. A subsequent live recording would also be available.
"Silent Alarm" was shortlisted for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize, but was beaten by Antony and the Johnsons' second album "I Am a Bird Now". It was also nominated for the 2005 Shortlist Music Prize, but lost to Sufjan Stevens' fifth album "Illinois". The record was named Album of the Year for 2005 by "NME" ahead of Arcade Fire's debut album "Funeral", by "Intro" in Germany, and by "Rumore" in Italy. "URB" included "Silent Alarm" in its unnumbered shortlist of the best records of 2005. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists: at number two by "Hot Press" and by Stylus, at number four by Drowned in Sound, at number six by "Spin", at number seven by Metacritic's chief editor, and at number nine by "The Denver Post". "Silent Alarm" earned Bloc Party several nominations, including Best Alternative Act at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards, Best British Band at the 2006 "NME" Awards, and Artist of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards. The record itself won Indie Rock Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards. It was also nominated as Best Album at the 2006 "NME" Awards, and as Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards.
