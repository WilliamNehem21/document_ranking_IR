In 1993, she played a young wife in the CBS miniseries "Return to Lonesome Dove", Nonnie Parker in the Disney film "A Far Off Place" and had a minor role in "Jack the Bear", which garnered her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star. The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film "S.F.W.", directed by Jefery Levy. In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller "Fear" alongside Mark Wahlberg, as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller "Freeway", alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields, where she held the lead role. Her character in "Freeway", Vanessa Lutz, is a poor girl living in Los Angeles, who encounters a serial killer on the way to her grandmother's home in Stockton. The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the "San Francisco Chronicle", with Mick LaSalle commenting, "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star. The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movieÂ â which scared me to deathÂ â I felt like I could try anything."
