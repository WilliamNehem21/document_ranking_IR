Hypothetical work following the war incorporated the similar line hypothesis of Paul Richards. Similar lines are organizes in which every one of the components are a similar length (or now and again products of the unit length), in spite of the fact that they may contrast in different measurements to give diverse trademark impedances. Richards' change permits any lumped component configuration to be taken "as may be" and changed legitimately into a circulated component configuration utilizing a straightforward change condition. In 1955 K. Kuroda distributed the changes known as Kuroda's characters. These made Richard's work increasingly usable in uneven and waveguide arranges by disposing of the hazardous arrangement associated components, however it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work turned out to be generally known in the English talking world. Another hypothetical advancement was the system blend channel approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he utilized the Chebyshev guess to decide component esteems. Cauer's work was to a great extent created amid World War II (Cauer was murdered towards its finish), yet couldn't be broadly distributed until threats finished. While Cauer's work concerns lumped components, it is of some significance to waveguide channels; the Chebyshev channel, a unique instance of Cauer's amalgamation, is generally utilized as a model channel for waveguide structures.
