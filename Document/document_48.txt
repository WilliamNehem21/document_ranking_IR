Derby moved south after his triumph, falling back on his interchanges as winter climate was setting in. He began clearing French fortresses from the fringe of An english area: the little manor at Pellegrue surrendered; that at MonsÃÂ©gur was raged. He at that point proceeded onward the vast, emphatically sustained town of La RÃÂ©ole. This involved a key position on the north bank of the Garonne waterway, just from Bordeaux. The town had been English until caught by the French twenty-one years sooner. It had appreciated impressive self-rule and rewarding exchanging benefits, which it had lost under the French. After exchanges with Derby, on 8 November the residents occupied the extensive French army and opened an entryway for the English. The army fled to the fortification, which was considered especially solid; the English continued to mine it. The army concurred a temporary surrender; on the off chance that they were not mitigated inside five weeks they would leave. They were permitted to convey this to the Duke of Normandy, however as he had recently disbanded his military, and it was in any case mid-winter, there was little he could do. Toward the beginning of January 1346 the army left and the English supplanted them. The town recovered its past benefits. Derby spent the remainder of the winter there.
