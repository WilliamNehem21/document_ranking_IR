Aside from a display as an undergrad, Lancaster had four substantial scale shows of his works. The first was in Norwich in 1955Ã¢ÂÂ 56, when Betjeman opened a show covering the scope of Lancaster's yield, including publications from the 1930s just as kid's shows, organize plans, watercolors and compositional illustrations. In 1967 a London show focused on his outfits and view, with instances of work from plays, ballet performances, musical drama and, astoundingly, film ("Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines", 1965). In 1973, at the impelling of Roy Strong, the National Portrait Gallery mounted "The Littlehampton Bequest", for which Lancaster painted pictures of Willy Littlehampton's alleged predecessors and posterity, in the style of specialists as the centuries progressed, from Holbein to Van Dyck and Lely, and after that to Reynolds and Gainsborough and on to Sargent and Hockney. Solid composed a prologue to the book Lancaster distributed of the gathered pictures. To stamp the centennial of Lancaster's introduction to the world, The Wallace Collection organized a show titled "Kid's shows and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster" from October 2008 to January 2009. It was curated by James Knox, the editorial manager and creator of a luxuriously represented life story and list with a similar title as the show.
