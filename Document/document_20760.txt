The "Lion"-class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the "Moltke" class as the German ships were to the "Invincible" class. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 40% increase in size over the "Indefatigable" class and made them the largest warships in the world. Their layout was adapted from the design of the first "super-dreadnought" class, the s of 1910, with 13.5-inch (343Â mm) guns. The ships were the first battlecruisers to be armed with the new 13.5-inch Mk V gun. The design of the "Lions" remedied some of the shortcomings of the preceding battlecruisers, which suffered from an inability of the "en echelon" amidships turrets to safely fire across deck, limiting them to a three-turret broadside. This was done because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered wing turrets impracticable. As such, all four turrets in the "Lion"s were arranged on the centreline; 'Q' turret was located amidships and could only fire on the broadside. The Director of Naval Construction, Sir Philip Watts, suggested that a fifth turret, superfiring over the rear turret, could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames, in total, and that this would add very little cost other than the Â£175,000 for the additional turret, but add 25% more firepower to the ship. This was not approved, possibly because of doubts about its feasibility.
