History specialist Nicholas Rodger called Edward III's case to be the "Sovereign of the Seas" into inquiry, contending there was not really any Royal Navy before the rule of Henry V (1413Ã¢ÂÂ 22). Regardless of Rodger's view, King John had officially built up a regal armada of galleys and had endeavored to set up an organization for these boats and ones which were captured (exclusive boats maneuvered into illustrious/national administration). Henry III, his successor, proceeded with this work. Despite the way that he, alongside his ancestor, had would have liked to build up a solid and effective maritime organization, their undertakings delivered one that was casual and generally impromptu. A formal maritime organization developed amid Edward's rule which was made out of lay overseers and headed by William de Clewre, Matthew de Torksey, and John de Haytfield progressively with them being titled "Assistant of the King's Ships". Sir Robert de Crull was the last to fill this situation amid Edward III's reign and would have the longest residency in this position. It was amid his residency that Edward's maritime organization would turn into a base for what developed amid the rules of successors, for example, Henry VIII's "Gathering of Marine" and "Naval force Board" and Charles I's "Leading body of Admiralty". Rodger likewise contends that for a significant part of the fourteenth century, the French had the advantage, aside from Sluys in 1340 and, maybe, off Winchelsea in 1350. However, the French never attacked England and France's King John II kicked the bucket in imprisonment in England. There was a requirement for an English naval force to assume a job in this and to deal with different issues, for example, the rebellion of the Anglo-Irish rulers and demonstrations of robbery.
