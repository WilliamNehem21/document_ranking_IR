By the ninth century the numerous kingdoms of the early Anglo-Saxon period had been merged into four: Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia. In the eighth century, Mercia had been the most dominant kingdom in southern England, yet in the early ninth, Wessex wound up prevailing under ÃÂthelstan's incredible extraordinary granddad, Egbert. Amidst the century, England went under expanding assault from Viking strikes, finishing in attack by the Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had invade East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and almost vanquished Wessex. The West Saxons battled back under Alfred the Great, and accomplished a conclusive triumph at the Battle of Edington. Alfred and the Viking head Guthrum conceded to a division that gave Alfred western Mercia, while eastern Mercia was fused into Viking East Anglia. During the 890s, restored Viking assaults were effectively fended off by Alfred, helped by his child (and ÃÂthelstan's dad) Edward and ÃÂthelred, Lord of the Mercians. ÃÂthelred ruled English Mercia under Alfred and was hitched to his girl ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d. Alfred passed on in 899 and was prevailing by Edward. ÃÂthelwold, the child of ÃÂthelred, King Alfred's more seasoned sibling and ancestor as ruler, made an offer for power, however was slaughtered at the Battle of the Holme in 902.
