Biko rejected the politically-sanctioned racial segregation government's division of South Africa's populace into inborn and ethnic gatherings, rather separating the populace into two classes: the white and the dark. He characterized darkness as a "psychological demeanor" instead of a "matter of pigmentation", alluding to "blacks" as "the individuals who are by law or convention politically, monetarily and socially victimized as a gathering in the South African culture" and who distinguish "themselves as a unit in the battle towards the acknowledgment of their desires". Along these lines, he and the Black Consciousness Movement utilized "dark" in reference not exclusively to Bantu-speaking Africans yet in addition to Coloreds and Indians, who together made up practically 90% of South Africa's populace during the 1970s. Biko was not a Marxist and trusted that it was mistreatment dependent on race, as opposed to class, which would be the fundamental political inspiration for change in South Africa. He contended that those on the "white left" regularly advanced a class-based investigation as a "resistance instrument... principally in light of the fact that they need to isolate us from anything identifying with race. In the event that it has a bounce back impact on them since they are white".
