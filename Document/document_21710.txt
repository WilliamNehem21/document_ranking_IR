Pinter's brief dramatic sketch "Precisely" (1983) is a duologue between two bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation and deterrence. His first overtly political one-act play is "One for the Road" (1984). In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities of power and its abuse. Pinter's "political theater dramatizes the interplay and conflict of the opposing poles of involvement and disengagement." "Mountain Language" (1988) is about the Turkish suppression of the Kurdish language. The dramatic sketch "The New World Order" (1991) provides what Robert Cushman, writing in "The Independent" described as "10 nerve wracking minutes" of two men threatening to torture a third man who is blindfolded, gagged and bound in a chair; Pinter directed the British premiÃ¨re at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in 1994. Pinter's longer political satire "Party Time" (1991) premiÃ¨red at the Almeida Theatre in London, in a double-bill with "Mountain Language". Pinter adapted it as a screenplay for television in 1992, directing that production, first broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 on 17 November 1992.
