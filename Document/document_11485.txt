As indicated by Josephus, following the demise of his dad, Antiochus X went to the city of Aradus where he announced himself ruler; it is conceivable that Antiochus IX, before confronting Seleucus VI, sent his child to that city for security. Aradus was a free city since 137 BC, implying that Antiochus X made a collusion with it, since he would not have had the capacity to stifle it by power at that phase of his rule. As the lines of Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX battled about Syria, the relatives of every ruler depicted themselves in the similarity of their particular dads to demonstrate their authenticity; Antiochus X's busts on his coins indicated him with a short nose that closes with an up-turn, similar to his dad. Antiquated Hellenistic rulers did not utilize regnal numbers. Rather, they generally utilized designations to separate themselves from different rulers with comparable names; the numbering of lords is for the most part a cutting edge practice. On his coins, Antiochus X showed up with the appellations "Eusebes" (the devout) and "Philopator" (father-cherishing). As indicated by Appian, the lord got the designation Eusebes from the Syrians since he got away from a plot on his life by Seleucus VI, and, authoritatively, the Syrians felt that he endure on account of his devotion, in any case, as a general rule, it was a whore in adoration with Antiochus X who spared him.
