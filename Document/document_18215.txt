The main technique Cage used for composition is that of nested proportions: an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines the structure of a piece on both the macroscopic and the microscopic level, so that the larger parts of each piece are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3Â¼, 3Â¼ (in whole notes), and a unit here is equal to 8Â½ bars (the end of a unit is marked with a double barline in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on the microscopic level. A is repeated, and AA forms the first part of the proportion on the macroscopic level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of Â¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3Â¼, 3Â¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3Â¼, 3Â¼: correlation on the macroscopic level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See "Example 2" for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.
