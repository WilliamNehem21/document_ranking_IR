Energized by Webster and new associate Richard Verrall, in the mid-1970s Tyndall came back to his transparently hardline methodology of advancing natural bigot and prejudiced thoughts. This did not support the NF's constituent prospects. In the 1979 general race, the NF mounted the biggest test of any guerilla party since the Labor Party in 1918, with 303 hopefuls. Among them were Tyndall's significant other, relative, and father-in-law. Tyndall remained in Hackney South and Shoreditch, verifying 7.6%; this was the Front's best outcome that race, yet was down from the 9.4% they had picked up in that electorate in October 1974. In the race, the NF "floundered grimly", verifying just 1.3% of the all out vote, down from 3.1% in October 1974. This decay may have been because of the expanded enemy of extremist crusading of the past couple of years, or in light of the fact that the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher had received an undeniably intense position on migration which pulled in huge numbers of the votes that had recently gone to the NF. NF enrollment had likewise declined, and by 1979 had tumbled to roughly 5,000. Tyndall by and by wouldn't weaken or direct his gathering's arrangements, expressing that to do as such would be the "credulous pursuing of moonbeams". In November 1979, Fountaine fruitlessly endeavored to remove Tyndall as pioneer, consequently building up the National Front Constitutional Movement.
