In October 1994, McVeigh demonstrated Michael Fortier and his better half, Lori, an outline he had drawn of the bomb he needed to fabricate. McVeigh intended to build a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate compost, blended with about of fluid nitromethane and of Tovex. Counting the heaviness of the sixteen 55-U.S.- gallon drums in which the unstable blend was to be pressed, the bomb would have a joined load of about . McVeigh had initially proposed to utilize hydrazine rocket fuel, yet it ended up being excessively costly. Amid the Chief Auto Parts Nationals National Hot Rod Association Drag Racing Championship Series occasion at the Texas Motorplex, McVeigh acted like a cruiser racer and at first endeavored to buy drums of nitromethane on the misrepresentation that he and some kindred bikers required the fuel for hustling, in spite of the absence of nitromethane-controlled bikes at the gathering, and not having a NHRA contenders' permit. Denied by one delegate, Steve LeSeuer, because of LeSeur's doubts of McVeigh's activities and frames of mind, he was then allowed to buy three barrels from another agent, Tim Chambers. Chambers scrutinized the buy of three barrels when regularly just 1-5 gallons of nitromethane, he noted, would be acquired by a Top Fuel Harley rider, despite the fact that the class was not hustled that end of the week. LeSeuer detailed the occurrence to the FBI following dismissing McVeigh's solicitation.
