In the interim, the Italian armies in the north were surrendering to the sixteenth Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the seventh Armored Division outside the stronghold; the 2/eighth Infantry Battalion had taken the territory above Wadi Meriega; and the 2/seventh Infantry Battalion had caught Posts 10, 12 and 15. Colonel Godfrey was dumbfounded to find that the 2/eleventh Infantry Battalion had caught Post 8. The transporter detachment of the 2/sixth Infantry Battalion assaulted and caught Post 13 while the 2/eleventh caught Post 6. The main post as yet holding out was currently Post 11. The 2/sixth Infantry Battalion restored its assault, with the infantry assaulting from the front and its bearers assaulting from the back. They were joined by Matildas from the region of Post 6. Now the Italian post administrator, who had been injured in the fight, brought down his banner and raised a white one. Approximately 350 Italian fighters surrendered at Post 11. Inside, the Australians discovered two field firearms, 6 antitank weapons, 12 medium automatic rifles, 27 light assault rifles, and two 3ÃÂ inch mortars. Godfrey searched out the Italian post authorityÃ¢ÂÂwho wore a British Military Cross earned in the First World WarÃ¢ÂÂand shook his hand. "On a war zone where Italian troops won little respect", Gavin Long later expressed, "the last to give in had a place with a battalion whose fearless battle would have done credit to any military."
