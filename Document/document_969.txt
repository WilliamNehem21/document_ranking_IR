Sir Francis Dashwood manufactured West Wycombe to engage, and there has been much theory on the sort of amusement he accommodated his visitors. Made a decision against the sexual ethics of the late eighteenth century, Dashwood and his club were viewed as indiscriminate; while all things considered, the contemporary reports of the bacchanalian bashes over which Dashwood managed in the Hellfire gives in above West Wycombe were overstated, free love and overwhelming drinking took place there. Dashwood frequently had himself delineated in representations in extravagant dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his affection for extravagant dress which appears to host plagued through to his gatherings at West Wycombe Park. Following the commitment of the West porch as the sanctuary of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his companions wearing skins enhanced with vine leaves and went to party by the lake for "Paeans and drinks". On another event, amid a counterfeit ocean fight on the trench, the skipper of the snow, "assaulting" a battery developed on the bank, was struck by the wadding of a weapon and endured inner damage. Dashwood later given a greater amount of his opportunity to political change and to magnanimous works; he had a functioning political vocation the majority of his grown-up life; a genuine occupation gave a false representation of by his notoriety for celebration. He kicked the bucket in 1781, passing on West Wycombe to his relative Sir John Dashwood-King, third Baronet.
