After the poor execution of galleys in RussoÃ¢ÂÂ Swedish war of 1741Ã¢ÂÂ 43 and the Pomeranian War (1757Ã¢ÂÂ 62), advancement of substitutions progressed toward becoming organized. Amid the Pomeranian War, preliminaries had been made with "weapon prams" ("skottprÃÂ¥mar"), intensely furnished, paddle driven, level bottomed freight ships with a shallow draft that conveyed firearms in broadside plans. The prams conveyed a larger number of firearms than the galleys, however turned out to be powerful. Augustin EhrensvÃÂ¤rd contended for new archipelago vessels that consolidated capability, mobility, fitness for sailing, and fair group lodging. He started a fruitful coordinated effort with shipwright Fredrik Henrik Chapman (recognized "af Chapman" in 1772), and together they created five new vessels: a gunboat with a 12-pounder firearm and a yacht fixing, just as four kinds of "archipelago frigates" ("skÃÂ¤rgÃÂ¥rdsfregatter"): the littler udema and pojama, and the bigger turuma and hemmema. Every one of the four sorts have been designated "skÃÂ¤rgÃÂ¥rdsfregatter" (archipelago frigates) in Swedish and English recorded writing, however a few writers have called the udema and pojama "archipelago corvettes". Chapman explicitly structured the archipelago frigates for administration off the south shore of Finland and named them after the Finnish areas of Uusimaa, "Pohjanmaa" (ÃÂsterbotten), "Turunmaa" (ÃÂboland), and "HÃÂ¤meenmaa" (Tavastia).
