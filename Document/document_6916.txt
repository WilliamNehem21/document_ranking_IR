The light AA deadly implement of the "FusÃÂ" class changed drastically from 1933 to 1944. Amid the main remaking, "FusÃÂ" was fitted with four fourfold automatic weapons, while "Yamashiro" was fitted with eight twin firearm mounts. The two weapons were permit manufactured French Hotchkiss plans. The 25ÃÂ mm firearms were mounted on the "FusÃÂ" class in single, twofold and triple mounts. This model was the standard Japanese light enemy of air ship firearm amid World War II, yet it experienced extreme structure inadequacies that rendered it a to a great extent incapable weapon. The twin and triple mounts "needed adequate speed in train or rise; the weapon sights were unfit to deal with quick focuses on; the firearm showed over the top vibration; the magazine was excessively little, and, at long last, the firearm created exorbitant gag impact". The design of the counter air ship firearms changed essentially; before the finish of their last recreation, the "FusÃÂ" class mounted eight twin mounts. In 1943, seventeen single and two twin-mounts were included for a sum of 37. In August 1944, both were fitted with another twenty-three single, six twin and eight triple-mounts, for an aggregate of 95 against air ship firearms in their last arrangement.
