In 2007, two teams of scientists independently named the Indian gondwanathere on the basis of new material; both teams included VPL/JU/NKIM/25 in their newly named species. Guntupalli Prasad and colleagues named the animal "Bharattherium bonapartei" on the basis of an additional tooth, VPL/JU/IM/33, from another Intertrappean locality, Kisalpuri. The generic name, "Bharattherium", combines "Bharat", Sanskrit for "India", with the Ancient Greek "therion", meaning "beast", and the specific name, "bonapartei", honors Argentine paleontologist JosÃ© Bonaparte, who was the first to describe a gondwanathere fossil. G.P. Wilson and colleagues named "Dakshina jederi" on the basis of six teeth (in addition to VPL/JU/NKIM 25), and identified some additional material as indeterminate gondwanatheres. Of these teeth, three (GSI/SR/PAL-G059, G070, and G074) are from a third Intertrappean site at Gokak and three (GSI/SR/PAL-N071, N210, and N212) are from Naskal. "Dakshina", the generic name, derives from Sanskrit "daakshinaatya" "of the south", and refers both to the animal's occurrence in southern India and to the distribution of gondwanatheres in the southern continents. The specific name, "jederi", honors University of Michigan paleontologist Jeffrey A. Wilson, nicknamed "Jeder", who played an important role in the project that led to the discovery of "Dakshina". Wilson and colleagues also described three other gondwanathere teeth from Gokak (GSI/SR/PAL-G111, G112, and G211), which they tentatively identified as a different species of gondwanathere on their small size. In 2008, Prasad commented that "Bharattherium bonapartei" and "Dakshina jederi" represented the same species and that "Bharattherium", which was published first, was the correct name.
