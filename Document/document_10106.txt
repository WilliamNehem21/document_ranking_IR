The totally reconsidered second release of "Lemurs of Madagascar" was audited in detail in the "American Journal of Primatology" by Stacey Tecot. Every section, area, and addendum was altogether condensed, and similarly as with the audits of past versions, the part on subfossil lemurs was noted as one of the more "captivating" portions of the book, especially because of its vivid and useful delineations. In spite of the fact that the book got just recognition, Tecot suggested two augmentations for the following version: the requirement for data about the procedures of island biogeography and development on hostage protection programs beside the Duke Lemur Center, especially at the Lemur Conservation Foundation and St. Catherines Island. A subject record was additionally suggested, alongside better referencing of the figures and delineations. Something else, the book was commended as being superior to anything other field directs because of its incorporation of apparently darken yet essential subtleties, for example, how to get to lemur watching destinations, travel time, where to remain, notices of lesser-known locales, postings of species to be seen, best occasions to watch, and even, in addition to other things, the quantity of habituated lemur bunches in every zone. Tecot noticed that the lemur agenda advanced aggressive lemur viewing, like birdwatching, and that the shading coded segments aided "on-the-fly species distinguishing proof." Although happy with the data accommodated every specie, Tecot complimented the guarantee made in this version to all the more broadly spread the distributed writing in the up and coming third release. Like its forerunner, the second release was applauded as an astounding apparatus for ecotourists and specialists. It was additionally noted for its endeavor to advance ecotourism as a preservation procedure.
