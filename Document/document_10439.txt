They are frequently alluded to by and large as "the men", as opposed to independently by their callings, making a quiet understanding between them of their harmony. The initial couple of sentences of segment three bear witness to this association: "It is hard to portray the unobtrusive fraternity of men that was here set up on the oceans.

They were a chief, an oiler, a cook, and a reporter, and they were companions, companions in a more inquisitively iron-bound degree than might be normal." Survival is likewise an essential topical component in itself, as it is dependent upon the men to fight the components so as to spare themselves. The journalist's longing to endure is apparent in his hold back of the melodious line: "In the event that I will be suffocatedÃ¢ÂÂon the off chance that I will be suffocatedÃ¢ÂÂon the off chance that I will be suffocated, why, for the sake of the seven distraught divine beings who rule the ocean, was I permitted to make significant progress and consider sand and trees?"
