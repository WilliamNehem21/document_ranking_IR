As the discouragement voyaged commonly westbound, the JTWC updated it to Tropical Storm Omar on AugustÃÂ 25, and the JMA took action accordingly on the following day. Omar started to moderate as it followed westbound. Surge from close-by Tropical Storm Polly toward the west delivered a flood of solid breeze shear over Omar, abating heightening. The JTWC noticed that the shear could decouple Omar's breeze flow from its convection, potentially debilitating the tempest. In any case, as Omar and Polly moved more remote separated, a high-weight edge created between the tempests. This caused Omar to float northward and after that west-northwestward into a locale with diminished shear, which enabled it to continue fortifying. Right off the bat AugustÃÂ 27, the JTWC updated the framework to a hurricane, and an eye started to show up around 23:00ÃÂ UTC that day. Omar entered a period of quick heightening on AugustÃÂ 28, so, all things considered the JMA likewise characterized it as a hurricane. The storm made landfall on Guam before long, with 1Ã¢ÂÂminute continued breezes of about 195ÃÂ km/h (120ÃÂ mph). The eye, 37ÃÂ km (23ÃÂ mi) in width, gradually crossed the northern segment of the little island over a time of 2.5ÃÂ hours.
