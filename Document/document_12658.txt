Running eight minutes longer than any in the arrangement, the scene was likewise the most specialized and complex. Whedon, who has expressed this is one of his top pick "Buffy" scenes, utilized a widescreen letterbox position for recording (the main scene in the arrangement to get this treatment), distinctive lighting to draw out the sets all the more energetically, and long takes for shootingÃ¢ÂÂincorporating a confused shot with a full discussion, a tune, and two arranged moves that took 21 endeavors to get right. These were intended to give watchers every one of the pieces of information they expected to build up every one of the subtleties of the connections between characters. Davies remarked that the complexities of recording this scene were "limitlessly more convoluted than a standard "Buffy"" scene, and Whedon expressed in the DVD analysis that he was goal-oriented to demonstrate what TV is able to do, saying "it just depends the amount you give it a second thought". UPN, the TV station that publicized "Buffy"s last two seasons, advanced the scene by showing Gellar's face on boards with music notes over her eyes, and held an uncommon debut occasion. System president Dean Valentine commented he thought it was "a standout amongst the best scenes of TV I at any point found in my life".
