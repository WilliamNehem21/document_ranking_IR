In 1834 Alkan started his companionship with the Spanish performer Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an all-inclusive and regularly private correspondence which just became known in 2009. Like for all intents and purposes the majority of Alkan's correspondence, this trade is presently uneven; the majority of his papers (counting his original copies and his broad library) were either obliterated by Alkan himself, as is obvious from his will, or progressed toward becoming lost after his passing. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave presentations and where the second "Concerto da camera" was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; it was distributed in London together with some performance piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French diary that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, show that he came back to England in 1835. Soon thereafter, Alkan, having discovered a position of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, finished his first really unique works for solo piano, the "Twelve Caprices", distributed in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16. Op.ÃÂ 16, the "Trois scherzi de bravoure", is devoted to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt suggested Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined, and in 1837 he composed an energetic survey of Alkan's Op.ÃÂ 15 Caprices in the "Revue et periodical musicale".
