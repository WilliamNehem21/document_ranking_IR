In ninth century Mercia and Kent, imperial sanctions were created by religious houses, each with its own style, however in Wessex there was a solitary regal political custom, most likely by a solitary organization representing the lord. This may have begun in Egbert's rule, and it turns out to be clear during the 840s, when ÃÂthelwulf had a Frankish secretary called Felix. There were solid contacts between the West Saxon and Carolingian courts. The Annals of St Bertin looked into Viking assaults on Britain, and in 852 Lupus, the Abbot of FerriÃÂ¨res and a protÃÂ©gÃÂ© of Charles the Bald, wrote to ÃÂthelwulf saluting him on his triumph over the Vikings and mentioning an endowment of lead to cover his congregation rooftop. Lupus additionally kept in touch with his "most dearest companion" Felix, soliciting him to deal with the vehicle from the lead. In contrast to Canterbury and the south-east, Wessex did not see a sharp decrease in the standard of Latin in contracts in the mid-ninth century, and this may have been somewhat due to Felix and his mainland contacts. Lupus imagined that Felix had incredible impact over the King. Sanctions were primarily issued from imperial bequests in provinces which were the heartland of antiquated Wessex, to be specific Hampshire, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset, with a couple in Kent.
