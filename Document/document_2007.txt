A wing of the little King Edward VII Memorial Hospital at Port Stanley was involved by 16 Field Ambulance. Its first undertaking was dealing with caught Argentine medicinal supplies. The military clinic wing opened on 29 June. "Uganda" tied up at Port William to supply reinforcement care, and gave fifty emergency clinic beds and bedding to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. Having cruised from the UK on the TEV "Rangatira" on 19 June, 2 Field Hospital achieved the Falkland Islands on 11 July. Its staff included fourteen officers and different positions of Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps. Its tent convenience had been lost on "Atlantic Conveyor", so it moved into the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. About of British ammo was recouped from 47 front line destinations by 81 Ordnance Company, alongside over 4.5 million rounds of Argentine ammo.
