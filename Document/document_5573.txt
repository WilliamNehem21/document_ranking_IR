As the Whig Party went into disrepair, Randall and his family moved toward becoming Democrats. Josiah Randall was benevolent with James Buchanan, a Pennsylvania Democrat at that point filling in as the United States' agent in Great Britain. Both Randall and his dad went to the Democratic National Convention in 1856 to work for Buchanan's selection for president, which was effective. At the point when, in 1858, an opportunity happened in Randall's state Senate locale, he kept running for race (as a Democrat) for the rest of the term, and was chosen. Still just 30 years of age, Randall had risen quickly in governmental issues. A lot of his term in the state Senate was gone through managing the consolidation of road railroad organizations, which he accepted would profit his area. Randall likewise bolstered enactment to diminish the intensity of banks, an approach that he would keep on pushing for his whole political profession. In 1860, he kept running for race to a full term in the state Senate while his sibling Robert kept running for a seat in the state House of Representatives. Overlooking their dad's recommendation that it signified "an excess of Randall on the ticket," the two siblings were ineffective.
