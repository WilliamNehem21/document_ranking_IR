Until 1860, the main realized dodo remains were the four fragmented seventeenth century examples. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not distribute the discoveries. In 1863, Owen mentioned the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word that he ought to be educated if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the administration schoolmaster at MahÃÂ©bourg, at long last found a plenitude of subfossil dodo bones in the marsh of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, following a 30-year seek motivated by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark disclosed his method to "The Ibis", an ornithology diary: he had sent his coolies to swim through the focal point of the marsh, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they discovered couple of bones, until they remove herbage that secured the most profound piece of the bog, where they found numerous fossils. The bog yielded the remaining parts of more than 300 dodos, yet not very many skull and wing bones, potentially in light of the fact that the chest areas were washed away or rummaged while the lower body was caught. The circumstance is like numerous finds of moa stays in New Zealand swamps. Most dodo stays from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dim darker colouration.
