Thom Jurek of "Allmusic" felt the "dim, persistently curved as-screw verses mirror a particular power," and adulated the band for interfacing their enemy of religion position with a conviction that religion has underscored numerous wars from the beginning of time. In any case, "Moving Stone"s Chris Steffen grieved that it had progressed toward becoming "out and out difficult to hear Tom Araya Ã¢ÂÂ at 45 years of age! Ã¢ÂÂ keep on belting out the band's undeniably self-mocking, against religious verses," and singled out verses, for example, "Religion's a prostitute" and "I've settled on my decision: six!" as ridiculous. Jamie Thomson of "The Guardian" composed that the collection left "no sacrilege... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" saw that "when not focusing on religion, the band return to their other most loved subject Ã¢ÂÂ war Ã¢ÂÂ in shockingly well-known terms," and commented that Slayer had sunk "to the dimension of God-repulsing dunderheads Deicide." He finished up the audit with the supposition that "It's sensation that this has happened before once more from "God Hates Us All" Ã¢ÂÂ and once you've titled something "God Hates Us All," haven't you made your point enough as of now?"
