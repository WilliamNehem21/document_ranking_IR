Since American inhabitants were hesitant to lease in the retail structures, Rockefeller Center's director Hugh Robertson, once of Todd, Robertson and Todd, proposed outside occupants for the structures. They held converses with planned Czech, German, Italian, and Swedish tenants who could conceivably possess the six-story universally themed structures on Fifth Avenue, despite the fact that it was accounted for that Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian occupancies were likewise considered. The first themed structure that was conceded to was the British Empire Building, the more southerly of the two structures, which would have legislative and business adventures of the United Kingdom. In February 1932, French inhabitants consented to involve the British Empire Building's twin toward the north, La Maison FranÃÂ§aise. A retail establishment and 30-story building (later changed to 45 stories) were made arrangements for the square toward the north of the twin structures, somewhere in the range of 50th and 51st lanes, with the retail establishment divide confronting Fifth Avenue. A "last" design change to that square happened in June, when the retail establishment was supplanted by the pinnacle's two retail wings, which would be almost indistinguishable to the twin retail structures to their south. The two new retail structures, associated with one another, and to the primary pinnacle, with a galleria, were proposed to serve Italian, and perhaps at the same time German, interests upon fruition.
