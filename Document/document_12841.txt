There had been coin deficiencies starting in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint extended generation to endeavor to fulfill need. The mid 1960s was a period of expanded utilization of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting weight on the cost of silver, which was topped at simply over $1.29 per ounce by government deals at that cost. The silver in a dollar of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as cash if the cost of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was boundless accumulating of silver coins. Interest for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from flow after its introduction in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint expanded generation, decreasing the coin deficiencies by May 1965, yet government supplies of silver were as a rule quickly diminished, and took steps to run out by 1968. After broad examination by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 prescribed that Congress pass enactment to consider silverless dimes and quarters, and degraded silver half dollars. Despite the fact that there was some resistance, essentially from officials speaking to Western mining states, the bill advanced quickly through Congress, and was authorized with Johnson's mark on July 23, 1965.
