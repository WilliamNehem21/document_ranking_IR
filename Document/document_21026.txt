In her review of the fifth series, Deborah Ross of the "Daily Mail" wrote of her sheer pleasure in watching the show without her children, calling it "still unfailingly brilliant and funny and silly, without ever losing its sense of purposeÂ ... There just isn't anything else on TV that can match it for ideas, writing and performance." Sarah Dempster of "The Guardian" agreed, adding that "Four years into its ingenious 'making history look less crap' operationÂ ... HH remains true to its aim, with meticulously harvested historical data + roaringly well-observed pop culture pastiches = seemingly infinite heritage lolz." Writing in "The Independent", Grace Dent commended the cast in particular, saying that the show "has the distinct feel of a group of bright, young, erudite, writery-actory sparks having a tremendously good time." Venning of "The Stage" reiterated his praise of the show, adding that "it also has the courage to tackle potentially controversial events head on", specifically citing the song featuring the Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks as retelling her story in a "clever, concise and accessible way without trivialising it." In 2016, Margaret Lyons of "The New York Times" praised the series as "deeply silly", "frequently hilarious", and,"very consistent".
