Fully expecting the endorsement of the enactment, Linderman had design coins arranged. In August 1874, Philadelphia Mint administrator James Pollock sent him designs with a front appearing situated Liberty by Philadelphia stone worker Joseph A. Bailly with a switch by boss etcher William Barber. Pollock did not favor Bailly's proposition, esteeming it excessively like the Seated Liberty plan which was then on all local silver coinage, thus the new coin would too intently take after the quarter. On March 31, 1875, after the establishment of Jones' bill, Pollock sent Linderman extra examples, all by Barber, and much more on April 12. Pollock expostulated a turn around structure with a shield, however Linderman preferred it and expressed that it would have been embraced yet for the law requiring a hawk to show up on silver pieces bigger than the dime. Linderman chose a front-side plan close indistinguishable to the next silver coinage (until 1916, the silver coins were given comparable appearances). That structure, by the late boss etcher, Christian Gobrecht, following an idea by Thomas Sully and Titian Peale, was first utilized in 1836 and by 1840 was on all groups of silver coins at that point being struck. The right-confronting bird is close indistinguishable to the one which Barber had rendered for the exchange dollar, which had appeared in 1873. Linderman had understood that the distinction in size between the new coin and quarter was little, and thought a downsized form of the exchange dollar reasonable for the twenty-penny piece; he got his way on the invert. The hawk conveys the bolts of war in its right, or predominant paw, and the olive part of harmony in the left, in heraldry inclining toward war over harmony.
