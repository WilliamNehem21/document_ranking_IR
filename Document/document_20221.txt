"The Lady's Last Stake" (1707) is a rather bad-tempered reply to critics of Lady Easy's wifely patience in "The Careless Husband". It was coldly received, and its main interest lies in the glimpse the prologue gives of angry reactions to "The Careless Husband", of which we would otherwise have known nothing (since all contemporary published reviews of "The Careless Husband" approve and endorse its message). Some, says Cibber sarcastically in the prologue, seem to think Lady Easy ought rather to have strangled her husband with her steinkirk:
Many of Cibber's plays, listed below, were hastily cobbled together from borrowings. Alexander Pope said Cibber's drastic adaptations and patchwork plays were stolen from "crucified MoliÃ¨re" and "hapless Shakespeare". "The Double Gallant" (1707) was constructed from Burnaby's "The Reformed Wife" and "The Lady's Visiting Day", and Centlivre's "Love at a Venture". In the words of Leonard R. N. Ashley, Cibber took "what he could use from these old failures" to cook up "a palatable hash out of unpromising leftovers". "The Comical Lovers" (1707) was based on Dryden's "Marriage Ã  la Mode". "The Rival Fools" (1709) was based on Fletcher's "Wit at Several Weapons". He rewrote Corneille's "Le Cid" with a happy ending as "Ximena" in 1712. "The Provoked Husband" (1728) was an unfinished fragment by John Vanbrugh that Cibber reworked and completed to great commercial success.
