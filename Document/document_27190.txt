In the United States, "4" debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200, with first-week sales of 310,000 copies. This gave BeyoncÃ© her fourth consecutive solo album to debut at number one on the "Billboard" 200 album chart, making her the second female artist, after Britney Spears, and third artist overall, tied with Spears and DMX to have her first four studio albums debut atop the "Billboard" 200. "4"s first-week sales became BeyoncÃ©'s lowest sales start with a studio album to date. Keith Caulfield of "Billboard" magazine noted that the album was not released during the festive season and that BeyoncÃ© was so far lacking a hit single, which could help explain the album's softer entry. It marks the third-largest sales week of the year, after the number-one bows of Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" and Adele's "21". "4" became the ninth numerically titled album to top the chart since 1956. In its second week, the album remained at number one on the "Billboard" 200, despite a 63% sales decrease, selling 115,000 copies. It hence became the first album by BeyoncÃ© to top the "Billboard" 200 albums chart for more than one week; an effort succeeded by her self-titled fifth studio album (2013) that remained there for three weeks. On August 1, 2011, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped one million copies to retail stores. As of December 2015, it has reached sales of 1.5 million copies in the United States.
