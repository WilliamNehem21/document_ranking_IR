Xiao Tong (501Ã¢ÂÂ 531), a crown ruler of the Liang Dynasty (502Ã¢ÂÂ 557), deified a few of Zhang's works in his scholarly treasury, "Choices of Refined Literature (Wen xuan" Ã¦ÂÂÃ©ÂÂ¸")". Zhang's compositions (, "fu") incorporate "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ("XÃÂ« jÃÂ«ng fÃÂ¹" Ã¨Â¥Â¿Ã¤ÂºÂ¬Ã¨Â³Â¦), "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody" ("DÃÂng jÃÂ«ng fÃÂ¹" Ã¦ÂÂ±Ã¤ÂºÂ¬Ã¨Â³Â¦), "Southern Capital Rhapsody" ("NÃÂ¡n dÃÂ« fÃÂ¹" Ã¥ÂÂÃ©ÂÂ½Ã¨Â³Â¦), "Song on Contemplating the Mystery" ("SÃÂ« xuÃÂ¡n fÃÂ¹" Ã¦ÂÂÃ§ÂÂÃ¨Â³Â¦), and "Song on Returning to the Fields" ("GuÃÂ« tiÃÂ¡n fÃÂ¹" Ã¦Â­Â¸Ã§ÂÂ°Ã¨Â³Â¦). The last breakers Daoist thoughts with Confucianism and was an antecedent to later Chinese supernatural nature verse, as per Liu Wu-chi. A lot of four short verse sonnets ("shi" Ã¨Â©Â©) entitled "Verse Poems on Four Sorrows" ("SÃÂ¬ chÃÂ³u fÃÂ¹" Ã¥ÂÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¨Â©Â©), is likewise included with Zhang's introduction. This set establishes probably the soonest heptasyllabic "shi" Chinese verse composed. While still in Luoyang, Zhang wound up propelled to compose his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" and "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody", which depended on the "Composition on the Two Capitals" by the student of history Ban Gu. Zhang's work was like Ban's, in spite of the fact that the last completely lauded the contemporaneous Eastern Han routine while Zhang gave a notice that it could endure a similar destiny as the Western Han in the event that it also declined into a condition of wantonness and good corruption. These two works mocked and reprimanded what he saw as the inordinate extravagance of the privileged societies. Zhang's "Southern Capital Rhapsody" recognized his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han Dynasty, Guangwu.
