Closely following "Victory" as she passed through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship , Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing "Victory"s stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship "SantÃ­sima Trinidad" and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun and the 74-gun , as she did so. "Redoutable"s broadside carried away "Temeraire"s mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from "Neptune", "Temeraire" narrowly avoided a collision with "Redoutable". Another broadside from "Neptune" brought down "Temeraire"s fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that "Redoutable" had come up alongside "Victory" and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board "Victory". "Temeraire" was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across "Redoutable"s stern, "Temeraire" discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Ãtienne Lucas, captain of "Redoutable", recorded that "...Â the three-decker ["Temeraire"]Â â who had doubtless perceived that the "Victory" had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken â ran foul of the "Redoutable" to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It would be impossible to describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it."
