"Mom & Me & Mom" (2013) is the seventh of Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. It was completed 11 years after the publication of her previous autobiography, "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" (2002), and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969). "Mom & Me & Mom", in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter, was published shortly before Mother's Day and Angelou's 85th birthday. In the time period between the publication of her sixth and seventh autobiographies, Angelou was the first African-American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing, who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their "Poetry for Young People" series in 2004. In 2009, Angelou wrote "We Had Him", a poem about Michael Jackson, which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral, and wrote "His Day is Done", a poem honoring Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013. She published a book of essays, "Letter to My Daughter", in 2009, and two cookbooks, "Hallelujah! The Welcome Table" in 2004 and "Great Food, All Day Long" in 2010. During this period, she was awarded the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.
