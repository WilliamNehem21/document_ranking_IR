As AOC Training Command, McLachlan attempted two surveys that would have, as indicated by the official history of the post-war RAAF, "a huge impact broadcasting live Force of the 1960s". In 1957, at the prompting of the Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger, McLachlan shaped a board to audit the viability of the schedule at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force during a time of guided rockets and atomic weaponry. This prompted an approach of cadets undertaking scholarly degrees, in accordance with comparable organizations in the other equipped administrations; the school was accordingly renamed RAAF Academy. The official history of the RAAF believed the outcome to be just incompletely effective; while it turned out very taught officers, they were instructed exclusively in an inflexible logical order fit to an Air Force that never appeared, one depending on rockets as opposed to kept an eye on flying machine. In 1959, McLachlan led a council to audit the adjustment in the RAAF's direction structure that had occurred in 1953Ã¢ÂÂ 54, from a geologically based "territory" framework to a practical framework comprising of Home, Maintenance Command, and Training Commands. Presuming this had diminished duplication and improved productivity, he proposed further defense by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to shape another association, Support Command. His arrangement was properly executed, similar to his proposal that Home Command, in charge of air tasks, be renamed Operational Command.
