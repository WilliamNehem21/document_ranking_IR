Swiatek and Breen depicted the Alabama half dollar as made up for lost time in the presidential decision of 1920, as a Republican organization probably won't be eager to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or may demand the new officeholder showing up, something liable to hose deals in Alabama, some portion of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the decision and was introduced in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen kept in touch with Baker, recommending another pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's CEO at the season of the 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first representative, William Bibb. Visual artist Frank Spangler of the "Montgomery Advertiser" arranged representations of the new plan. At James Fraser's proposal, the mortar models were made by his better half, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a prominent stone carver in her own right. She transported her finished work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and picked up individuals' endorsement; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage kicks the bucket. Laura Fraser in this way turned into the primary lady to structure a coin, of the U.S., yet of any nation.
