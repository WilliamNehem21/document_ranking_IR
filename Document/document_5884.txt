On MarchÃÂ 3, 1880, four men looted the station's sheltered. They broke into the terminal late during the evening and hauled the safe to the focal point of the station. They at that point endeavored to penetrate openings into the safe and detonate it with black powder, yet falling flat that, cut off one of its sides. The substance of the safe were 300 stogies and a couple of bills and papers. After the suspects were captured in Poughkeepsie, the nearby sheriff was hesitant to exchange the suspects to New Paltz. The Poughkeepsie police were resolute that they be paid promptly for their administrations. The day after their capture, the men were permitted to go to a hair parlor for a shave; a few observers were unfit to distinguish the suspects along these lines, and the officers were openly scolded for inadequacy. Stogies in the speculates' pockets were indistinguishable to the stogies in the safe, and alongside apparatuses recuperated from the site, they were utilized to distinguish the men. The suspects were conveyed to a prison in Kingston pending the decision of a terrific jury that April. A huge group accumulated at the New Paltz warehouse to watch them withdraw. The men were portrayed as "cracksmen of the main water", potentially "sharp", thus capable at safe-splitting that, "in the event that they any shot whatsoever, or hold of any weapon, they pick their direction thro' the correctional facility as effectively as drilling through a lime stack". The men were in this manner indicted. Because of the robbery, station specialist Dwight Marsh was given a pistol, and it progressed toward becoming approach not to keep assets in the safe medium-term. On DecemberÃÂ 8, 1880, another cheat broke a window at the terminal and stole a case of stogies.
