With the MirageÃÂ 2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF was looked with a decision between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and a few other RAAF pilots tried United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and revealed that the flying machine had astounding execution however could be hard to control now and again. The assessment group was additionally worried about the unwavering quality of the F-16's motor and viewed the air ship as mechanically juvenile. It was likewise noticed that the air ship's radar was second rate compared to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s couldn't fire the past visual-run (BVR) aerial rockets and long-go hostile to delivery rockets that the F-18A was equipped for working. Conversely, the assessment group was awed by the F-18A, and viewed it just like an increasingly strong and survivable air ship as it had been intended to work from plane carrying warships; these highlights were critical for tasks from exposed bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and detailed that the flying machine took care of well, yet had a few lacks with its flight control framework and motors; these were not seen as significant imperfections by the assessment group, in any case. The F-18A's twin motors were viewed as its principle leeway over the single-engined F-16, as research directed by the assessment group found that the whittling down rate for single-engined warriors was twice that for air ship with two motors. By and large, in any case, the RAAF made a decision about that both the F-16 and F-18A were unreasonably youthful for a choice to be made in 1980 as had been initially arranged, and prescribed to the Government this be conceded by a year.
