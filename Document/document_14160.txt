In the same way as other plants in south-west Western Australia, "B.ÃÂ prionotes" is adjusted to a domain in which bushfire occasions are moderately visit. Most "Banksia" species can be set in one of two general gatherings as per their reaction to flame: "reseeders" are murdered by flame, yet fire likewise triggers the arrival of their overhang seed bank, in this way advancing enlistment of the people to come; "resprouters" endure fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, all the more once in a while, epicormic buds ensured by thick bark. "B.ÃÂ prionotes" is bizarre in that it doesn't fit flawlessly into both of these gatherings. It comes up short on a lignotuber or thick bark, thus can't be considered a resprouter; yet it might endure or get away from certain flames in view of its tallness, the meager condition of its foliage, and in light of the fact that it happens in hill swales where fire are cooler and patchier. Then again, it's anything but a regular reseeder either, due to its generally low flame death rates, and on the grounds that it is just pitifully serotinous: in spite of the fact that fire advances seed discharge, seed discharge still happens without flame.
