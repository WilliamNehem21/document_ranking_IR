The "Enterprise" interior sets were mostly new designs. The bridge was designed to be comfortable-looking, with warm colors. Among the new additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate only when activated, leaving a plain wall when disabled. New flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays, using less space and giving the bridge a cleaner look. The new monitors also allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with the actors. The designers created a larger and less spartan ready room, retaining elements from the television series; Zimmerman added a set of golden three-dimensional "Enterprise" models to a glass case in the corner. The observation lounge was similar to the design in the "Enterprise"-D; the set itself was re-used from the television show, the only such set not to be struck following the filming of "Generations", though it was expanded and underwent a color change. Engineering was simulated with a large, three-story set, corridors, a lobby, and the largest warp core in the franchise to date. For its Borg-corrupted state, the engineering section was outfitted with Borg drone alcoves, conduits and Data's "assimilation table" where he is interrogated by the Queen. Some existing sets were used to save money; sickbay was a redress of the same location from "Voyager", while the USS "Defiant" scenes used "Deep Space Nine"s standing set. Some set designs took inspiration from the "Alien" film series, "Star Wars" and "2001: A Space Odyssey".
