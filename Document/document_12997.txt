At around ten years old, Narayan took in the nuts and bolts of "dhrupad", the most established type of Hindustani traditional music, by considering and copying the act of "sarangi" player Uday Lal of Udaipur, an understudy of "dhrupad" artists Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal passed on of seniority, Narayan met voyaging vocalist Madhav Prasad, initially of Lucknow, who had performed at the court of Maihar. With Prasad, Narayan ordered the "ganda bandhan", a conventional function of acknowledgment between an instructor and his understudy, in which Narayan swore compliance in return for being kept up by Prasad. He served Prasad and was educated in "khyal", the prevail sort of Hindustani established music, yet came back to Udaipur following four years to encourage music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and persuaded him to leave his position and devote his opportunity to progress as a performer, in spite of the fact that surrendering an unfaltering life was not generally welcomed by Narayan's family. He remained with Prasad and made a trip to a few Indian states until Prasad became sick and exhorted him to gain from artist Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore. Following Prasad's passing in Lucknow, Narayan authorized the "ganda bandhan" with another instructor who gave him exercises, however before long left for Lahore and never played out the custom again.
