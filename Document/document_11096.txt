On 31 October 1517, Luther sent a letter to the Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose expert the guilty pleasures were being sold. In the letter, Luther tends to the diocese supervisor out of a devoted want to caution him to the peaceful issues made by the guilty pleasure messages. He accept that Albert is unconscious of what is being lectured under his position, and stands up of worry that the general population are being driven far from the gospel, and that the extravagance lecturing may convey disgrace to Albert's name. Luther does not denounce extravagances or the present tenet with respect to them, nor even the messages which had been lectured themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Rather he expresses his worry in regards to the false impressions of the general population about extravagances which have been encouraged by the proclaiming, for example, the conviction that any transgression could be excused by guilty pleasures or that the blame just as the discipline for wrongdoing could be pardoned by an extravagance. In a postscript, Luther composed that Albert could discover a few postulations on the issue encased with his letter, so he could see the vulnerability encompassing the principle of guilty pleasures rather than the ministers who talked so unquestionably of the advantages of extravagances.
