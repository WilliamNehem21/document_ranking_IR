Angelou perceives that there are anecdotal viewpoints to every one of her books; she tended to "wander from the regular idea of personal history as truth". Her methodology parallels the traditions of numerous African-American collections of memoirs composed amid the abolitionist time frame in the US, when truth was regularly edited for motivations behind self-security. Creator Lyman B. Hagen has set Angelou in the long custom of African-American personal history, yet demands that she has made a remarkable elucidation of the self-portraying structure. In a 1998 meeting with writer George Plimpton, Angelou talks about her composition procedure, and "the occasionally elusive thought of truth in true to life" and journals. Whenever inquired as to whether she changed reality to improve her story, she expressed, "Now and then I make a measurement from a composite of three or four individuals, on the grounds that the embodiment in just a single individual isn't adequately solid to be expounded on." Although Angelou has never confessed to changing certainty in her accounts, she has utilized the actualities to have an effect with the peruser. As Hagen states, "One can expect that 'the pith of the information' is available in Angelou's work". Hagen additionally expresses that Angelou "fictionalizes, to upgrade intrigue". Angelou's long-lasting manager, Robert Loomis, concurs, expressing that she could revamp any of her books by changing the request of her certainties to have an alternate effect on the peruser.
