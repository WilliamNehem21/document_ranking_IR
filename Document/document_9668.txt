In Old Irish, the sonorants (those spelled ) were separated into wide and thin sorts, yet additionally into fortis and lenis types. The exact phonetic meaning of these terms is to some degree obscure, yet the coronal fortis sounds (those spelled ) were presumably longer in span and may have had a bigger region of contact between the tongue and the top of the mouth than the lenis sounds. Fortis "m" was likely a typical , while lenis "m" was a nasalized semivowel , maybe tending towards a nasalized fricative or when palatalized. By tradition, the fortis coronals are translated with capital letters , the lenis with lower case (a few creators, for example, , rather utilize Latin for fortis and Greek for lenis). In this way Old Irish had four rhotic phonemes , four horizontal phonemes , and four coronal nasal phonemes . Fortis and lenis sonorants appeared differently in relation to one another among vowels and word-at last after vowels in Old Irish, for instance ('he shears') versus ('he may convey'); ('hazel') versus ('sin'); ('stake') versus ('sound'). Word-at first, just the fortis sounds were found, yet they progressed toward becoming lenis in conditions where morphosyntactically activated lenition was discovered: ('secret') versus ('his secret'), ('arrangement') versus ('his arrangement').
