Film essayist Paul Simpson takes note of how intently Steiger arranged for his jobs, and how he "easily" reproduced the quirks of figures, for example, Mussolini, in a "convincing interpretation of a perplexing figure". Judith Crist of "New York Magazine", exploring "Duck, You Sucker!", remarked that Steiger was "absolutely without quirks, dependably with way", and noticed that his "hushes are incredibly powerful". Roger Ebert later reverberated this announcement, agreeing that Steiger needed quirks, expressing, "When he gets a character worth playing with, he makes it new from the base up, out of entire material. I don't have the foggiest idea how he does it. It's as though he gets inside the skin of the person he's playing and begins being that individual for some time". Steiger stated: "I constantly attempted to do things unique. On the off chance that I got a job which was like another I'd endeavor to do it somewhat extraordinary." His hazardous screen exhibitions were an impact on numerous later on-screen characters, including Robert De Niro, who utilized Steiger's depiction of Al Capone as a source of perspective for his very own execution in "The Untouchables" (1987). Elvis Presley was very awed with Steiger's "incredible and twisting execution" in "The Pawnbroker".
