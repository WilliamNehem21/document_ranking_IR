In 2000, The Public Library arrangement of Jacksonville, Florida was looked with a claim from traditionalist Christian gathering Liberty Counsel of Orlando after they started granting "Hogwarts' Certificate of Accomplishment" to youthful perusers who finished the fourth "Harry Potter" novel, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire". One parent grumbled that "In the event that they are going to go out black magic authentications they should likewise advance the Bible and go out testaments of exemplary nature". The claim was deflected after the Library consented to quit granting the endorsement. That equivalent year, Carol Rookwood, headmistress of St Mary's Island Church of England Aided School in Chatham, Kent, England, restricted the books from school grounds, saying that, "The Bible is extremely clear and reliable in its lessons that wizards, fiends and evil presences exist and are genuine, ground-breaking and unsafe, and God's kin are advised to have nothing to do with them". Accordingly, the director of the Church of England's precept bonus, Stephen Sykes, stated, "The Church's position is that enchantment and magic are in opposition to the Christian religion, Mrs Rookwood is totally right. [But] youngsters who are fit for perusing Harry Potter could be advised not to pay attention to black magic, or may even understand that for themselves". In July 2000, Birkenhead Primary School in Auckland, New Zealand put a restriction on the "Harry Potter" books being perused out loud by educators in class after parental protests with respect to the books' apparently mysterious substance. Nonetheless, the boycott was lifted after various understudies and guardians griped. Additionally in 2000, Christian guardians griped to the educational committee in Durham Region, Ontario about "Harry Potter", and figured out how to get the books expelled from school library racks. The books were reestablished after an open objection.
