Development of the SRÃÂ 520 passage venture started in April 2011 on the Eastside, where WSDOT extended the road to six paths and included carpool lanes. The venture, finished in 2014, likewise incorporated the development of new transport stations and direct access inclines, new exchanges, park covers covering SRÃÂ 520, and a multi-use trail. Development of the new drifting extension started in 2012, and it was committed on April 2, 2016, as the longest coasting scaffold on the planet. The westward paths opened on April 11 and the eastward paths were opened on April 25. The new, connect highlights four broadly useful paths and two carpool lanes, just as a multi-use trail on its north side that opened on December 20, 2017. Destruction of the previous scaffold was finished in mid 2017. The western methodology was incompletely supplanted with another extension for westward traffic in August 2017, with the eastward paths staying on the old methodology connect. As a feature of the undertaking, a few "phantom inclines" in the Washington Park Arboretum for the dropped R.H. Thomson Expressway were destroyed in 2017, in spite of calls to save them in memory of the challenges that dropped the activities during the 1960s.
