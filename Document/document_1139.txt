With material from past articles, Weisman utilizes the destiny of the Mayan human progress to delineate the likelihood of a settled in the public eye evaporating and how the indigenous habitat rapidly disguises proof. To show how vegetation could bargain human fabricated framework, Weisman talked with hydrologists and representatives at the Panama Canal, where consistent upkeep is required to keep the wilderness vegetation and sediment far from the dams. To show relinquished urban communities capitulating to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (surrendered in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (deserted in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures disintegrate as climate does unrepaired harm and other living things make new environments.
