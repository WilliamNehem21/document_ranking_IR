Thietmar of Merseburg composes that Stephen got the crown "with the support and asking" of Emperor Otto III (r. 996Ã¢ÂÂ 1002), inferring that Stephen acknowledged the Emperor's suzerainty before his crowning ceremony. Then again, the majority of Stephen's legends underscore that he got his crown from Pope Sylvester II (r. 999Ã¢ÂÂ 1003). KristÃÂ³ and different students of history bring up that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close partners, which suggests that the two reports are substantial: Stephen "got the crown and sanctification" from the Pope, however not without the Emperor's assent. Around 75 years after the crowning ordinance, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1075Ã¢ÂÂ 1085), who asserted suzerainty over Hungary, announced that Stephen had "offered and devotedly surrendered" Hungary "to Saint Peter" (that is to the Holy See). In a differentiating report, Stephen's "More prominent Legend" expresses that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Current historiansincluding PÃÂ¡l Engel, and MiklÃÂ³s MolnÃÂ¡rwrite that Stephen constantly affirmed his power and never acknowledged ecclesiastical or royal suzerainty. For example, none of his sanctions were dated by the long stretches of the rule of the contemporary heads, which would have been the situation on the off chance that he had been their vassal. Besides, Stephen proclaimed in the prelude to his "First Book of Laws" that he administered his domain "by the desire of God".
