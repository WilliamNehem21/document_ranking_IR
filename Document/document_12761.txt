The 2008 Lethal Lockdown coordinate was the seventh session on the card, between Team Cage (Christian Cage, Matt Morgan, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Sting) and Team (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The term of the challenge was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown coordinate is battled under no preclusion rules, in which weapons are lawful and one wrestler from each group begins the match in the pen. A while later, individuals from each group enter at time interims until all wrestlers are engaged with the session so a pinfall or accommodation can happen. Enclosure and Styles began the match. Sibling Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the request of doors for the challenge. Soon after Sting's passageway, a rooftop shrouded in weapons was brought down onto the confine. With Sting's interest all men were engaged with the match, in that capacity a pinfall or accommodation could now happen. Amid the experience, Cage set up a table over the top of the enclosure. Afterward, he and Styles were battling over a stepping stool over the confine, when Storm pushed over the stepping stool causing them both to crash through the table. Tempest at that point moved down from the rooftop into the enclosure, where Rhino handled and stuck him to verify the triumph for Team Cage.
