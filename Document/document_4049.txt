On 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau started arrangements to clear key staff and hardware from Warsaw. Before long an uncommon departure train, the Echelon F, transported them eastbound, at that point south. When the Cipher Bureau was requested to cross the outskirt into partnered Romania on 17 September, they had crushed every touchy report and gear and were down to a solitary exceptionally packed truck. The vehicle was seized at the outskirt by a Romanian officer, who isolated the military from the regular citizen work force. Exploiting the perplexity, the three mathematicians overlooked the Romanian's directions. They foreseen that in an internment camp they may be distinguished by the Romanian security police, in which the German Abwehr and SD had sources. The mathematicians went to the closest railroad station, traded cash, purchased tickets, and loaded up the main train traveled south. Following twelve or so hours, they achieved Bucharest, at the opposite end of Romania. There they went to the British international safe haven. Advised by the British to "return a couple of days", they next attempted the French international safe haven, presenting themselves as "companions of Bolek" (Bertrand's Polish code name) and requesting to talk with a French military officer. A French Army colonel called Paris and after that issued directions for the three Poles to be helped with emptying to Paris.
