Strife, or Angelou's introduction of contrary energies, is another subject in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas". As Lupton states, Angelou develops a plot by blending contradicting occurrences and dispositions - Angelou's "persuasive strategy". The book is brimming with clashes: in Angelou's marriage, her sentiments between being a decent mother and a fruitful entertainer, the generalizations about different races, and her new encounters with whites. Lupton trusts this introduction of contention is the thing that makes Angelou's composition "splendid"; she finds that the quality of "Singin' and Swingin' " comes, to some degree, from Angelou's duplication of contentions basic the plot, characters, and thought designs in the book. Lupton includes, "Relatively few other contemporary autobiographers have had the capacity to catch, either in a solitary volume or in an arrangement, the resistance of wants that is found in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" and, to a lesser degree, in Angelou's different volumes". Indeed, even the end sentence of the book ("Although I was not an incredible artist I was his mom, and he was my magnificent, conditionally autonomous child") exhibits Angelou's argumentative development, totals up the inconsistencies of Angelou's character, and insinuates mother/child designs in her later books.
