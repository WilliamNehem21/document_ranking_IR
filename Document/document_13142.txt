Following a police examination that kept going over a year, on 21 August 1984 the preliminary against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. The two men were accused of swindling "Stern" of 9.3ÃÂ million DMs. Regardless of the earnestness of the charges confronting the two men, Hamilton thinks about that "it likewise seemed clear that the preliminary would have been a sham, a genuine droll issue that would anger the judge and entertain the whole world." The procedures kept going until July 1985, when the two men were sent to jail: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and a half year for Kujau. In September one of the supporting officers administering the case was supplanted after he nodded off; after three days the court were "entertained" to see pictures of Idi Amin's undies, which Heidemann had confined on his divider. Now and again the case "stigmatized into a slanging match" among Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that "the carelessness of "Stern" has induced me to mellow the sentences against the two primary co-schemers." Heidemann was discovered liable of taking 1.7ÃÂ million DMs from "Stern"; Kujau liable of accepting 1.5ÃÂ million DMs for his job in the phonies. In spite of the extensive examination and preliminary, in any event fiveÃÂ million DMs remained unaccounted for.
