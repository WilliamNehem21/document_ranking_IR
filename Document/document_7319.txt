She had been harmed in the head, and a foreman was executed before her. She ended up aloof and discouraged, was proclaimed crazy on 19 September 1916, and invested energy in two insane person havens. In mid 1920, she was accounted for missing from her Berlin lodgings, and from that point forward had not been seen or gotten notification from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's sibling Felix Schanzkowski was acquainted with Tschaikovsky at a nearby motel in Wasserburg close Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's child, Dmitri, was totally sure that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was perceived by Felix as his sister, yet Leuchtenberg's girl, Natalie, stayed persuaded of Tschaikovsky's validness.
