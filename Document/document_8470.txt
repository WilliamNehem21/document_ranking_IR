There has been much hypothesis in print about the character of the young lady in the melody. Clinton Heylin states that the most as often as possible mooted applicants are Echo Helstrom, an early sweetheart of Dylan from the place where he grew up of Hibbing, and Suze Rotolo, for whom Dylan was pining as he completed the melody in Italy. Howard Sounes recommends the young lady Dylan presumably had as a primary concern was Bonnie Beecher, a sweetheart of Dylan's the point at which he was at the University of Minnesota. Musicologist Todd Harvey takes note of that Dylan not just took the tune of "Scarborough Fair", which he gained from Martin Carthy in London yet additionally adjusted the subject of that melody. "Scarborough Fair" gets from "The Elfin Knight" (Child Ballad Number 2), which was first deciphered in 1670. In the tune, an otherworldly character suggests a progression of conversation starters to a guiltless, mentioning her to perform unthinkable undertakings. Harvey calls attention to that Dylan "holds the possibility of the audience being sent upon an errand, a northern spot setting, and an antique verse quality". Dylan came back to this tune on "Nashville Skyline" (1969), recording it as a two part harmony with Johnny Cash, and he came back to it again in the studio with an unreleased organ and sax form in 1978.
