After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even "Carmen" was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from "Carmen" and the "L'ArlÃ©sienne" suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw an increase of interest. "Don Procopio" was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of "Les pÃªcheurs de perles" was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses. After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, Sir Thomas Beecham. Excerpts from "La coupe du roi de ThulÃ©", edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the BBC on 12 July 1955, and "Le docteur Miracle" was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group. "Vasco da Gama" and "Ivan IV" have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music. "Carmen", after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878). It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting lifeâ"not idealised life but life as actually lived".
