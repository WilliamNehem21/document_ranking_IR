The blended open response stands out strongly from the reaction from compositional commentators. Its uncontrolled unpredictability, iconography and layering of significance and allegory are broadly viewed as creating a structure which seems to be "a significant feast". This provoked Catherine Slessor, writing in the "Compositional Review", to portray it as "A Celtic-Spanish mixed drink to knock the two socks off and spending plans, it doesn't play safe, vigorously mining another crease of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century." Jencks endeavored to hose analysis of the cost invades by addressing how 'esteem for cash' may be judged. For him, the structure isn't only a practical or monetary undertaking, it is an investigation of national personality and in contrasting it with other tantamount congregations, not least the Palace of Westminster, he contends the expense is similar. The origination of the structure has been singled out for applause, especially in the way it restores Scotland's conventional concentration towards terrain Europe and its qualities by methods for the format of the non-ill-disposed discussing chamber and the production of the open spaces before the structure, "where individuals can meet and convey what needs be as a power". In a period of the Bilbao impact and the famous structure, Jencks is awed that instead of being a stupendous structure, as is regular for capital tourist spots, the structure makes an intricate association of nature and culture that settles itself into the scene.
