The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are accepted to have been utilized for riverine mass transportation of individuals and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo-Saxon and Norman occupation. Roman Somerset, which went on for over 250ÃÂ years until around the start of the fifth century, had different settlements, including Bath ("Aquae Sulis"), Ilchester ("Lindinis") and lead mines at Charterhouse; and four streets encompassing the Somerset Levels. There is proof of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was not well recorded before its pulverization by quarrying and disintegration. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank close where the present King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was being used between the first and the fourth hundreds of years. Proof of a broad site with storage facilities was found in the mid-1970s, amid motorway development works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been connected by a likely Roman street over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the biggest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with extensive storage facilities, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by methods for a cleared passage. The Yeo was safe by little art right to the Parrett enabling military supplies to be conveyed by pontoon straightforwardly to Ilchester; in any case, disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and utilization of the Polden Hills roadway enabled progressively fast development to Ilchester. The Yeo may as of now have been fixed and canalized before Roman occupation.
