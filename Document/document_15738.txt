While Karl Aloys zu FÃ¼rstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois classâthe First and Third estatesâled a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French "Ã©migrÃ©" nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French Ã©migrÃ©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792â1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.
