To plan for the task, de Campi read more than 4000 pages of Archie comic books. She drew motivation for the story from the 1940s time of the arrangement, when she says Archie Andrews' lady friends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had "more edge". Her contents were liable to notes and changes from Archie Comics and Fox, however de Campi portrayed both licensors as "very smooth, lovely and simple to work with". Fox's essential concern was the reason the Predator, who is known for picking testing prey, would be keen on adolescents, yet an appropriate clarification was incorporated into the story. She anticipated a portion of the notes, for example, being outlined for, "Alex, you can't poke fun at tyke predation in an Archie book". Different occasions, she was astounded when she didn't get notes, for example, her utilization of emoticons for the Predator's discourse. She was satisfied when she got the chance to add profundity to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is frequently neglected in normal "Archie" funnies. The decision of whether Archie Andrews would endure the arrangement or not was changed a few times amid scripting, and a ultimate conclusion was not made until the last draft of the content.
