In a 1986 article for "The New York Times" on Coleman's work with Prime Time, Robert Palmer said "Of Human Feelings" was as yet creative and radical by the models of other music in 1982, three years after it was recorded. Since essayists and performers had heard its test squeezing in 1979, the collection's blend of jazz extemporization and abrasive, punk and funk-determined vitality sounded "prophetic" when it was discharged, Palmer clarified. "The collection is plainly the ancestor of much that has sounded drastically new in the progressing combination of punk shake, dark move rhythms, and free jazz." AllMusic pundit Scott Yanow said despite the fact that Coleman's sytheses never accomplished prominence, they prevailing inside the setting of a collection that exhibited his unmistakable saxophone style, which was high-temples yet snappy. Joshua Klein from "The A.V. Club" prescribed "Of Human Feelings" as the best collection for new audience members of Coleman's harmolodics-based music, while "Chicago Tribune" shake pundit Greg Kot included it in his guide for amateur jazz audience members; he named it one of only a handful couple of collections that helped him both become a superior audience of shake music and figure out how to appreciate jazz. In 2008, "New York" magazine's Martin Johnson included it in his rundown of standard collections from what he felt had been New York's sceneless yet crucial jazz of the past 40 years; "Of Human Feelings" oozed what he depicted as a soul of complexity with components of funk, Latin, and African music, which were all epitomized by music that held a jazz personality.
