Truman called Secretary of Defense George Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Omar Bradley, Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Averell Harriman to talk about what to do about MacArthur. They agreed MacArthur ought to be calmed of his direction, yet made no proposal to do as such. In spite of the fact that they felt that it was right "from a simply military perspective", they knew that there were imperative political contemplations too. Truman and Acheson concurred that MacArthur was resistant, yet the Joint Chiefs maintained a strategic distance from any proposal of this. Defiance was a military offense, and MacArthur could have mentioned an open court military like that of Billy Mitchell. The result of such a preliminary was questionable, and it may well have discovered him not blameworthy and requested his restoration. The Joint Chiefs concurred that there was "little proof that General MacArthur had ever neglected to do an immediate request of the Joint Chiefs, or acted contrary to a request". "In purpose of actuality", Bradley demanded, "MacArthur had extended yet not lawfully disregarded any JCS orders. He had disregarded the President's 6 December mandate [not to own open expressions on approach matters], handed-off to him by the JCS, however this did not comprise infringement of a JCS request." Truman requested MacArthur's help by Ridgway, and the request went out on 10 April with Bradley's mark.
