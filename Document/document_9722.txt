The roughly 650 Mexican troops rapidly fabricated blockades all through the town. Inside days the Texian armed force, around 450 in number, started an attack of BÃÂ©xar, and progressively drew their camp closer BÃÂ©xar. On October 27, a development party driven by James Bowie and James Fannin picked Mission ConcepciÃÂ³n as the following campground and sent for the remainder of the Texian armed force. On discovering that the Texians were incidentally partitioned, Ugartechea drove troops to connect with Bowie and Fannin's men. The Mexican mounted force was unfit to battle successfully in the lush, riverbottom territory, and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had an a lot shorter range than those of the Texians. After three Mexican infantry assaults were spurned, Ugartechea required a retreat. One Texian officer had kicked the bucket, and somewhere in the range of 14 and 76 Mexican warriors were slaughtered. Despite the fact that Texas Tech University teacher emeritus Alwyn Barr noticed that the clash of ConcepciÃÂ³n "ought to have taughtÃÂ ... exercises on Mexican boldness and the estimation of a decent cautious position", Texas history master Stephen Hardin trusts that "the overall simplicity of the triumph at ConcepciÃÂ³n ingrained in the Texians a dependence on their long rifles and a scorn for their foes".
