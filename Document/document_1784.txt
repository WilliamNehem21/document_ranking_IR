The French arrangement required a spring (AprilÃ¢ÂÂ MayÃ¢ÂÂ June) hostile, amid which two French armed forces would press against the flanks of the Coalition's northern militaries in the German states and a third armed force moved toward Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's military would drive south from DÃÂ¼sseldorf, ideally drawing troops toward themselves, while Moreau's military massed on the east side of the Rhine by Mannheim; a deft bluff toward Mannheim made Charles reposition his troops. When this happened, Moreau's military executed a constrained walk south and, on 23 June, overpowered the bridgehead at Kehl. The Imperial troops there included just 7,000 troops enlisted that spring from the Swabian Circle commonwealths; regardless of their absence of experience and preparing, they held the bridgehead for a few hours before withdrawing toward Rastatt. Moreau strengthened the bridgehead with his forward watchman and his troops filled Baden unhindered. In the south, by the Swiss city of Basel, Ferino's section moved rapidly over the stream and propelled (eastbound) up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline toward Lake Constance, spreading into the southern end of the Black Forest. Stressed that his supply lines would be overextended or his military would be flanked, Charles withdrew toward the east. Before the finish of July, the whole of the Swabian Circle, the majority of Bavaria, Franconia, Baden and Wuerttemberg had achieved a different harmony with the French. which incapacitated the Imperial armed force, and gave French free rein to request supplies from the southern nations.
