RAAF flying preparing was intensely revamped not long after the flare-up of World WarÃÂ II, in light of Australia's interest in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). A few basic flying preparing schools were framed, to give fundamental flight guidance to cadets, while further developed pilot guidance was to occur at administration flying preparing schools. On 1ÃÂ May 1940, No.ÃÂ 1 FTS was re-shaped at Point Cook as No.ÃÂ 1 Service Flying Training School (No.ÃÂ 1 SFTS). Its debut leader was Group Captain John Summers, who drove Fighter Squadron in the mid 1930s and had taken over No.ÃÂ 1 FTS in December 1939. The school's Instructors' Training Squadron was separated to turn into the core of a re-shaped Central Flying School, which migrated to Camden, New South Wales, in June. Courses at the administration flying preparing schools comprised of two streams, transitional and propelled; the all out length shifted amid the war as interest for aircrew changed. At first running for about four months, the course was sliced to ten weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. After a year it was raised to twelve weeks (counting 100 hours flying time), and again to about four months two months after the fact. It kept on expanding after this, topping at 28 weeks in June 1944.
