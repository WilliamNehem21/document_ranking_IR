Following the court-military of the five instigators, there was banter among the general population, in the media, and inside government over the sentences; while most concurred that a revolt had happened, there were contrasts in supposition on the mercy or seriousness of the disciplines forced. Open compassion was with the mariners, and a few legislators influenced the legislature and the Admiralty to exculpate the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were reasonable, however on 10 September declared that they would be divided on thought of the mariners' childhood. Notwithstanding this, debate proceeded until 21 November: after the Australian government bid legitimately to the Admiralty, it was concurred that the mariners would be discharged on 20 December. Be that as it may, the administration had enraged the Naval Board in engaging the Admiralty without counseling the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, presented their acquiescences in challenge, as they felt the show of leniency would prompt a breakdown in control, and that if the administration kept on speaking with the Admiralty without counseling the Board, it would undermine the Board's position. The two officers were later persuaded to pull back their acquiescences in the wake of accepting affirmations that Board would be counseled before all future government correspondences to Britain with respect to the RAN, and that notification would be posted in all boats clarifying that the sentences were right, however the beginning of harmony had prompted leniency in this specific case.
