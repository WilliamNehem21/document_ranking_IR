Subsequent to testing, the space explorer applicants needed to sit tight 10 to 12 days for the outcomes. Glenn had come back to his situation at the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics when he got a call from the partner chief of Project Mercury, Charles Donlan, offering him a position. The characters of the seven were declared at a question and answer session at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. In "The Right Stuff", Tom Wolfe composed that Glenn "left it as tops among seven reasonable haired young men. He had the most sweltering record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the solitary Marine." The extent of the test in front of them was clarified half a month later, the evening of May 18, 1959, when the seven space explorers assembled at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket dispatch, of a SM-65D Atlas, which was like the one that was to convey them into space. A couple of minutes after liftoff, it detonated staggeringly, illuminating the night sky. The space explorers were dazed. Shepard swung to Glenn and stated: "Well, I'm happy they got that off the beaten path."
