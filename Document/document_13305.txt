Since the midÃ¢ÂÂ 1970s, references to "Four Years Among the Cannibals" have kept on showing up in concentrates on New Guinea. During the 1990s, Detzner's work got some restoration from ethnographer Terence Hays, who put Detzner's work in its contemporary setting: "Four Years Among the Cannibals", he expressed, "prepared for me [to become an ethnographer] by making romanticized pictures that filled in as a scenery for progressively genuine readings". From that point forward, geographer Robert Linke has brought up some critical issues: "For what reason did Detzner resort to misleads decorate his magnificent story? The unadorned truth would have been sufficient to build up him as one of the extraordinary figures in New Guinea history." Detzner had stayed everywhere for a long time, as a criminal in foe held region: doubtlessly, Linke closed, this was a remarkable accomplishment. Most likely the Australians could have made an all the more comprehensively composed endeavor to catch him, and presumably would have succeeded, yet they didn't try; they favored rather the more advantageous "shoot-at-locate" technique. "It is unthinkable", Linke expressed, "not to appreciate his [Detzner's] sheer "elan", his strength and diligence." In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, republished, and promoted as an advanced interpretation of an uncommon and important book about the investigation of the New Guinean inside amid World War I.
