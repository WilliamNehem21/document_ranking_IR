"Crush" received "favorable" reviews, while "CRUSH3D" received "average" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The PSP version was highly praised for its innovative approach to gameplay. Ryan Davis of GameSpot appreciated "Crush" for owing "very little of its novel concept to games that preceded it". Nick Suttner of "1UP" called the game a "cognitively rewarding, expertly designed puzzle experience that truly plays like nothing else". Reviews were mixed on the game's learning curve. IGN's Jeremy Dunham praised the ordering of the puzzle elements, that new gaming elements are introduced at "an ideal pace", and that most puzzles have solutions where the player must "think 'outside the box'". "Eurogamer"s Dan Whitehead commented that the game introduces these elements too quickly and "doesn't give you much time to put the basics into practice". Some critics found that elements of the game detracted from the game's uniqueness. "X-Play"s Greg Orlando, while stating that this was "one of the most novel games ever made", noted that it was "simply not very fun", as it lacked many player incentives beyond manipulating the world and collecting objects on each level. Reviewers noted that some puzzles were awkward due to the selection of the PlayStation Portable's controls. Reviewers found the game's story poor, but this was overcome by the gameplay elements; Charles Herold of "The New York Times" said "the minimal story is as forgettable as its puzzles are ingenious." Gus Mastrapa of "The A.V. Club" said that the game "satisfies the innate gamer need to express the world in easy-to-manipulate numbers and objects." GamesRadar included "Crush" in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli stated that the ability to switch from 2D to 3D was "one of the most unique (at the time) features weâve ever seen."
