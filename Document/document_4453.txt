Sprinkled with his stage plays, Richardson made thirteen film films amid the decade. On screen he played chronicled figures including Sir Edward Carson ("Oscar Wilde", 1960), WEGladstone ("Khartoum", 1966) and Sir Edward Gray ("Oh! What a Lovely War", 1969). He was circumspect about verifiable exactness in his depictions, and investigated times and characters in extraordinary detail before shooting. At times his accuracy was more prominent than executives wished, as when, in "Khartoum", he demanded wearing a little dark finger-slow down in light of the fact that the genuine Gladstone had worn one after damage. After a pretending a handicapped head honcho and Sean Connery's dad in "Lady of Straw", in 1965 he played Alexander Gromeko in Lean's "Specialist Zhivago", an uncommonly fruitful film in the cinema world, which, together with "The Wrong Box" and "Khartoum", earned him a BAFTA selection for best driving on-screen character in 1966. Other film jobs from this period included Lord Fortnum ("The Bed Sitting Room", 1969) and Leclerc ("The Looking Glass War", 1969). The throws of "Gracious! What a Lovely War" and "Khartoum" included Olivier, however he and Richardson did not show up in similar scenes, and never met amid the recording. Olivier was at this point running the National Theater, incidentally based at the Old Vic, however demonstrated little want to enlist his previous associate for any of the organization's preparations.
