The Court Architect ("Jiangzuo dajiang" Ã¥Â°ÂÃ¤Â½ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥ÂÂ ) was responsible for the development, upkeep, and fix of supreme castle lobbies, government corridors, sanctuaries, grave tumuli, structures in funerary parks, streets driving out of the capital, and flood control works. His compensation rank was 2,000-"dan". He coordinated the endeavors of recruited corvÃÂ©e workers until this obligation was exchanged to the service of the recently made Excellency of Works in 8 BC. The Court Architect's subordinates were in charge of social occasion timber for woodworkers and stone for artisans. In spite of the fact that his office existed at the foundation of Eastern Han, it was canceled in 57 AD and his obligations were exchanged to an Internuncio in the Ministry of the Household. Be that as it may, the post was restored in 76 AD with the first compensation rank, yet a significant number of his subordinates remained annulled. Since most structures were developed from wood, with fired rooftop tiles, an extensive workforce was expected to keep up structures that fell into dilapidation. The reclamation of the Imperial University amid Emperor Shun's (r. 125Ã¢ÂÂ 144 AD) rule required 100,000 workers to labor for a year under the supervision of the Court Architect.
