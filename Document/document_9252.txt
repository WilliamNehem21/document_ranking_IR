Two other French ships still flew the tricolor, yet nor was in a situation to either withdraw or battle. Whenever "Heureux" and "Mercure" had sliced their grapple links to get away from the detonating "Situate", their groups had terrified and neither commander (both of whom were injured) had figured out how to recapture control of his ship. Thus, the two vessels had floated onto the shore. "Alexander", "Goliath", "Theseus" and "Leander" assaulted the stranded and unprotected boats, and both surrendered inside minutes. The diversions given by "Heureux", "Mercure" and "Equity" permitted Villeneuve to bring the vast majority of the enduring French boats to the mouth of the inlet at 11:00. On the dismasted "Tonnant", Commodore Du Petit Thouars was currently dead from his injuries and tossed over the edge at his own solicitation. As the ship was unfit to make the required speed it was driven shorewards by its team. "TimolÃÂ©on" was excessively far south to escape with Villeneuve and, in endeavoring to join the survivors, had additionally grounded on the reef. The power of the effect ousted the ship's foremast. The staying French vessels: the boats of the line "Guillaume Tell" and "GÃÂ©nÃÂ©reux" and the frigates "Equity" and "Diane", shaped up and emerged to ocean, sought after by "Fanatical". Notwithstanding strenuous endeavors, Captain Hood's separated ship went under substantial flame and was unfit to remove the trailing "Equity" as the French survivors got away seawards. "Fanatical" was struck by various French shot and lost one man murdered.
