I don't have a clue on the off chance that regardless she views herself as connected to youÃ¢ÂÂyet she clearly can't wed youÃ¢ÂÂit's not really "not too bad"! There's another point as wellÃ¢ÂÂwhich is simply the individual burden and troubleÃ¢ÂÂI had all the previous winter, for all intents and purposes to keep 2 days seven days for you to come and see herÃÂ ... She should wedÃ¢ÂÂShe and I can't in any way, shape or form continue carrying on with this female life for all intents and purposes ÃÂ  deux for ever, and we haven't cash enough to separateÃÂ ... You should leaveÃ¢ÂÂEnglishmen don't comprehend yr American ways, and any man who needed to wed her wd be put off by the reality of yr fellowship (or whatever you call it) with her. On the off chance that you had Ã¢ÂÂ¤500 per year I ought to be enchanted for you to wed her!
