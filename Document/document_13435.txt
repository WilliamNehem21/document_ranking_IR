Both the Americans and the British misconstrued the idea of "Canadien" (as French Canadians were then known) society. The medieval idea of "Canadien" society with the "seigneurs" and the Catholic Church owning the land drove the British to accept the "habitants"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as the sharecroppers who made up by far most of Quebec's populace were knownÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ would respectfully comply with their social bosses while the Americans trusted that the "habitants" would invite them as heroes from their primitive society. Actually, the "habitants", in spite of being sharecroppers, would in general showcase a large number of similar attributes shown by the ranchers in the 13 states who for the most part possessed their property, being depicted differently as individualistic, obstinate, and vivacious together with a propensity to be inconsiderate and ill bred of power assumes if their activities were viewed as out of line. The greater part of the "habitants" needed to be unbiased in the battle between Congress versus the Crown, simply needing to experience their lives in harmony. Carleton's romanticized perspective on "Canadien" society drove him to misrepresent the readiness of the "habitants" to comply with the "seigneurs" as he neglected to comprehend that the "habitants" would battle for a reason that they saw as being to their greatest advantage. An expansive number of the "Canadiens" still clung to the expectation that one day Louis XVI would recover his kingdom's lost state of New France, yet up to that point, they needed to be disregarded.
