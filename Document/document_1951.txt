On 23 May the Storting passed the Consulate Act setting up a different consular administration. Lord Oscar declined his consent; on 27 May the Norwegian bureau surrendered, yet the ruler would not perceive this progression. On 7 June the Storting singularly declared that the association with Sweden was broken down. In a strained circumstance the Swedish government consented to Norway's solicitation that the disintegration ought to be put to a submission of the Norwegian individuals. This was hung on 13 August 1905 and brought about a staggering vote in favor of partition, so, all things considered King Oscar surrendered the crown of Norway while holding the Swedish honored position. A second choice, held in November, established that the new free state ought to be a government as opposed to a republic. Fully expecting this current, Michelsen's administration had been thinking about the appropriateness of different rulers as possibility for the Norwegian royal position. Looked with King Oscar's refusal to permit anybody from his own House of Bernadotte to acknowledge the crown, the favored decision was Prince Charles of Denmark. In July 1905 Michelsen sent Nansen to Copenhagen on a mystery mission to convince Charles to acknowledge the Norwegian position of royalty. Nansen was effective; not long after the second submission Charles was declared ruler, taking the name Haakon VII. He and his significant other, the British princess Maud, were delegated in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 22 June 1906.
