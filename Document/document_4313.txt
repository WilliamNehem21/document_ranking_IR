In 1841, LÃÂ©on Escudier composed of a presentation given by Chopin that year, "One may state that Chopin is the maker of a school of piano and a school of creation. In truth, nothing meets the softness, the sweetness with which the writer preludes on the piano; additionally nothing might be contrasted with his works brimming with creativity, qualification and beauty." Chopin wouldn't fit in with a standard strategy for playing and trusted that there was no set method for playing great. His style depended widely on his utilization of extremely free finger procedure. In his "Projet de mÃÂ©thode" he stated: "Everything involves knowing great fingeringÃÂ ... we need no less to utilize the remainder of the hand, the wrist, the lower arm and the upper arm." He further expressed: "One needs just to think about a specific position of the turn in connection to the keys to get easily the most wonderful nature of sound, to realize how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] boundless expertise." The outcomes of this way to deal with strategy in Chopin's music incorporate the incessant utilization of the whole scope of the console, entries in twofold octaves and other harmony groupings, quickly rehashed notes, the utilization of elegance notes, and the utilization of differentiating rhythms (four against three, for instance) between the hands.
