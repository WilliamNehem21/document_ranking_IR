Around early afternoon, some separation upper east of Hulterstad, the Swedish armada made what the military student of history Ingvar SjÃÂ¶blom has depicted as "a broadly discussed move". On account of misconceptions and inadequately planned flagging, the Swedish armada endeavored to turn and draw in the associated armada before they had cruised past the northern end of ÃÂland, which had been conceded to before the fight. Sharp turns in unpleasant climate were known to be dangerous, particularly for boats that had dependability shortcomings. "Kronan" swung to port (left), yet with an excessive amount of sail, and obeyed so far over that she started to flood through the open gunports. The group was unfit to address the awkwardness and the ship laid over totally with the poles parallel with the water. Before long, the black powder store in the forward piece of the "Kronan" touched off for obscure reasons and detonated, tearing separated a substantial segment of the starboard side forward of the mainmast. The rest of the area ascended with the stern pointing undetermined and the severed front part toward the base. She at that point quickly sank with the port side down. At the point when the disaster area hit the seabed, the body endured a noteworthy break along its side, further harming the structure.
