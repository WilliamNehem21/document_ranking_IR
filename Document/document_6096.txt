At the encouraging of Senator Clay, Harrison immediately called an uncommon session of Congress. With the Whigs to compose the House out of the blue, Fillmore looked for the Speakership, yet it went to a Clay assistant, John White of Kentucky. All things considered, Fillmore was made executive of the House Ways and Means Committee. Harrison was relied upon to oblige anything Clay and other congressional Whig pioneers proposed, however kicked the bucket on April 4, 1841, hoisting Vice President Tyler to the administration. Tyler, an onetime nonconformist Democrat, before long broke with Clay over congressional proposition for a national bank to balance out the money, which he vetoed twice, prompting his removal from the Whig Party. Fillmore stayed on the edges of that contention, by and large supporting the congressional Whig position, however his main accomplishment as Ways and Means executive was the Tariff of 1842. The current duty did not ensure assembling, and part of the income was disseminated to the states, a choice made in better occasions that was by then draining the Treasury. Fillmore arranged a bill raising levy rates that was famous in the nation, however the continuation of dispersion guaranteed a Tyler veto, and much political favorable position for the Whigs. When Tyler vetoed it, a House advisory group headed by Massachusetts' John Quincy Adams censured his activities. Fillmore arranged a second bill, this time discarding dissemination, and when it achieved his work area, Tyler marked it, yet in the process insulted his past Democratic partners. In this way, Fillmore accomplished his administrative objective, however figured out how to politically confine Tyler.
