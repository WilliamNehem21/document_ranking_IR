The cylinders that contain the hymenium (spore-bearing tissue) on the underside of the top are up to long, adnate when youthful, getting to be decurrent or almost so with age. In youthful examples, they are whitish to pale buff, and are secured with smooth beads that become darker to ochraceous when dried. As examples develop the shade of the pore surface changes to yellowish, lastly to dull yellow. The precise pores, which are 1Ã¢ÂÂ 1.5ÃÂ mm in width, are not radially masterminded, and don't change shading when wounded. The stipe is strong (instead of empty), long, and thick close to the top. Its shape is variable: either generally measure up to in width all through, thicker at the base, or to some degree thicker in the center. Its surface is dry and smooth, and secured with unpredictably formed glandular dabs. The specksÃ¢ÂÂminute bunches of pigmented cellsÃ¢ÂÂare at first ruddy before getting to be caramel. The foundation shade of the stipe is at first whitish (generally a similar shading as the cylinders), yet turns out to be progressively yellow with age. It doesn't change shading when wounded, and does not have a ring. The substance of the stipe is white, and does not change shading when presented to air.
