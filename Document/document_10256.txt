One of Gilbert's most loved comic topics is the height of an inadequate individual to a place of high obligation. In "The Happy Land" (1873), for instance, Gilbert portrays a world in which government workplaces are granted to the individual who has minimal capability to hold each position. Specifically, the person who has never known about a ship is selected to the bureau post of First Lord of the Admiralty. In "Pinafore", Gilbert returns to this topic in the character of Sir Joseph, who ascends to a similar position by "never go[ing] to ocean". In later Gilbert and Sullivan musical dramas, the characters Major-General Stanley in "Privateers", and Ko-Ko in "The Mikado", are comparatively delegated to high office however deficient with regards to the essential capabilities. Gilbert likewise makes jokes about gathering legislative issues, suggesting that when Sir Joseph "dependably casted a ballot at [his] gathering's call", he yielded his own respectability. The "business white collar class" (which was Gilbert's fundamental gathering of people) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the extraordinary unwashed. Likewise, the clear age contrast among Ralph and the Captain, despite the fact that they were babies breast fed together, parodies the variable period of Thaddeus in "The Bohemian Girl". "The Times" composed, in evaluating the 1929 creation, that "Pinafore" was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a "fatherly" Captain and the "ethicsÃÂ ... of all sentimentalism" are acknowledged "unflinchingly" and taken to their obvious end result: "It is the reference to fact that is basic; without it, the silliness won't stand distinctly out".
