The "retiarius" was routinely hollowed against a vigorously outfitted "secutor". The net-warrior compensated for his absence of defensive apparatus by utilizing his speed and spryness to keep away from his rival's assaults and trusting that the open door will strike. He originally attempted to toss his net over his opponent. On the off chance that this succeeded, he assaulted with his trident while his enemy was entrapped. Another strategy was to capture his adversary's weapon in the net and haul it beyond his control, leaving the rival unprotected. Should the net miss or the "secutor" grasp it, the "retiarius" likely disposed of the weapon, in spite of the fact that he may attempt to gather it back for a second cast. Normally, the "retiarius" needed to depend on his trident and knife to complete the battle. The trident, as tall as a person, allowed the fighter to poke rapidly and stay away. It was a solid weapon, fit for incurring puncturing wounds on an unprotected skull or appendage. The knife was the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s last reinforcement should the trident be lost. It was held for when close battle or a straight wrestling match needed to settle the session. In certain fights, a solitary "retiarius" confronted two "secutores" at the same time. For these circumstances, the gently defensively covered warrior was set on a raised stage and given a supply of stones with which to repulse his followers.
