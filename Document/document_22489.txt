Four of Sharpe's earliest churchesÂ â StÂ Saviour, Bamber Bridge (1836â37); StÂ Mark, Witton (1836â38);. Christ Church, Chatburn (1837â38); and StÂ Paul, Farington, near Leyland (1839â40)Â â were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because "no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque". They "turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'... with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged". The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements were the chapel of All Saints, Marthall, near Knutsford (1839); StÂ Mary, Conistone in Wharfedale (1846); and StÂ Paul, Scotforth in south Lancaster (1874), the last built towards the end of his life.
By 1838 Sharpe had begun to experiment with elements of English Gothic architecture, initially in the Early English style and in particular the lancet window, dating from the early 12thÂ century or earlier. The first church he built in this style was StÂ John the Evangelist, Cowgill, Dent, (1837â38), followed closely by Holy Trinity, Howgill (1837â38), and then by several others in the same style. He was soon incorporating elements from later styles of English Gothic architecture, and by 1839 was designing churches using Perpendicular features, as at StÂ Peter, Stainforth (1839â42), StÂ John the Baptist, Bretherton, and StÂ Peter, Mawdesley (both 1839â40).
