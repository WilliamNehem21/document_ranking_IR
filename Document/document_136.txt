In 1061 Ealdred made a trip to Rome to get the pallium, the image of a diocese supervisor's power. Venturing with him was Tostig, another child of Earl Godwin, who was presently baron of Northumbria. William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred, by "diverting the effortlessness of King Edward and asserting the custom of his forerunners, had obtained, more by renumeration than by reason, the archbishopric of York while as yet holding his previous see." On his entry in Rome, in any case, charges of simony, or the purchasing of ministerial office, and absence of learning were brought against him, and his height to York was declined by Pope Nicholas II, who additionally ousted him from Worcester. The narrative of Ealdred being dismissed originates from the "Vita Edwardi", a real existence of Edward the Confessor, yet the "Vita Wulfstani", a record of the life of Ealdred's successor at Worcester, Wulfstan, says that Nicholas denied the pallium until a guarantee to discover a trade for Worcester was given by Ealdred. One more writer, John of Worcester, makes reference to nothing of any inconvenience in Rome, and while examining the arrangement of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was chosen openly and collectively by the church and individuals. John of Worcester additionally asserts that at Wulfstan's sanctification, Stigand, the ecclesiastical overseer of Canterbury removed a guarantee from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would make a case for any purview over the see of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester composed his narrative after the emission of the CanterburyÃ¢ÂÂ York matchless quality battle, the tale of Ealdred denying any cases to Worcester should be viewed as suspect.
