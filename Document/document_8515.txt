"Vasa" had four protected decks: the upper and lower weapon decks, the hold and the orlop. On account of the limitations of setting up the ship for protection, the archeologists needed to work rapidly, in 13-hour shifts amid the principal seven day stretch of exhuming. The upper weapon deck was enormously aggravated by the different rescue extends somewhere in the range of 1628 and 1961, and it contained not just material that had tumbled down from the apparatus and upper deck, yet in addition over three centuries of harbor reject. The decks underneath were logically less aggravated. The gundecks contained not simply weapon carriages, the three enduring guns, and different objects of a military sort, but at the same time were the place a large portion of the individual assets of the mariners had been put away at the season of the sinking. These incorporated a wide scope of free finds, just as chests and barrels with extra garments and shoes, devices and materials for retouching, cash (as low-division copper coins), secretly obtained arrangements, and the majority of the ordinary articles required for life adrift. The majority of the finds are of wood, affirming not exclusively to the straightforward life ready, however to the for the most part unsophisticated territory of Swedish material culture in the mid seventeenth century. The lower decks were principally utilized for capacity, thus the hold was loaded up with barrels of arrangements and explosive, curls of grapple link, iron shot for the firearms, and the individual assets of a portion of the officers. On the orlop deck, a little compartment contained six of the ship's ten sails, fixing saves, and the working parts for the ship's siphons. Another compartment contained the assets of the ship's craftsman, including a substantial apparatus chest.
