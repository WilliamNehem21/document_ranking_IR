"Banksia attenuata" is generally encountered as a tree up to tall. In the north of its range as the climate becomes warmer and drier, it is often a stunted multistemmed shrub tall. Both forms occur in the vicinity of Hill River but there is otherwise a marked demarcation.
In the Wheatbelt and east of the Stirling Range, it is a stunted tree. Tree forms have a solid trunk, generally wavy or bent, with thick crumbly orange-grey bark which is a red-brown underneath. It regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its fire-tolerant trunk. It has long narrow shiny green linear leaves long and wide. The leaf margins have v- or u-shaped serrations along their length. The new growth is a pale grey-green, and occurs mainly in the late spring and summer, often after flowering. The brilliant yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) occur from spring into summer and are up wide and up to tall. They are made up of many small individual flowers; a study at Mount Adams north of Perth revealed a count of 1933 (Â± a standard error of 88) flowers per inflorescence, and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a count of 1720 (Â± 76) flowers. Anthesis proceeds up the flower spike over about 10 to 20 days, and is asynchronous. That is, a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over the flowering season.
