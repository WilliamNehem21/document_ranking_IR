After two years, Morley was granted a similar printing imposing business model that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an appointee (as opposed to experienced printers, for example, East or Peter Short, both of whom had recently worked with Morley) is astonishing. Morley may have been searching for help in testing the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his chosen ones. Around then, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was effectively implementing the Day syndication. Grain, in any case, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley distributed "The Whole Booke of Psalmes" and Richard Allison's "Psalmes of David in Meter". The previous was a little pocket version that was to a great extent dependent on East's 1592 production of a similar name. This work, despite the fact that pilfered and loaded up with little blunders, gives some proof of Barley's article expertise; musicologist Robert Illing takes note of that if Barley "is to be defamed for roguery, he should likewise be acclaimed for his strokes of melodic creative ability" for effectively packing such a huge work into a pocket-sized generation. In Allison's work, the two guaranteed that they had restrictive rights on the metrical psalter. Appropriately incited, Day sued. The result of his claim isn't known, yet neither Barley nor Morley at any point distributed another metrical psalter.
