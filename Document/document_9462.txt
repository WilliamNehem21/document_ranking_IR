In the last two hundred years, the maps have been sufficiently exact for the separation from the vestiges to the ocean to be estimated. The 400ÃÂ m (440ÃÂ yd) in 1817 had turned out to be 320ÃÂ m (350ÃÂ yd) by 1835, 275ÃÂ m (300ÃÂ yd) in 1907, and 195ÃÂ m (215ÃÂ yd) before the finish of the twentieth century. The spit is moving towards the territory at about 1ÃÂ m (1ÃÂ yd) every year; and a few raised islands or "eyes" have just been lost to the ocean as the shoreline has moved over the saltmarsh. Landward development of the shingle implied that the channel of the Glaven, itself exhumed in 1922 on the grounds that a prior, all the more northerly course was overpowered among Blakeney and Cley, was getting to be blocked progressively regularly. This prompted flooding of Cley town and the naturally imperative freshwater swamps. The Environment Agency thought about various healing choices. Endeavoring to keep down the shingle or breaking the spit to make another outlet for the Glaven would be costly and most likely incapable, and doing nothing would be ecologically harming. The Agency chose to make another course for the stream toward the south of its unique line, and work to realign a 550ÃÂ m (600ÃÂ yd) stretch of waterway 200ÃÂ m (220ÃÂ yd) further south was finished in 2007 at an expense of about ÃÂ£1.5ÃÂ million.
