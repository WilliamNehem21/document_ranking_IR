Albeit too old to even consider serving in the military, Blackburn upheld the Confederate reason amid the Civil War. In the beginning of the war, he went about as a non military personnel specialist for the administrations of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was helping Confederate barricade sprinters in Canada. In 1864, he made a trip to Bermuda to help battle a yellow fever episode that undermined Confederate bar running tasks there. Not long after the war's end, a Confederate twofold specialist blamed him for having done a plot to begin a yellow fever plague in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war exertion. Blackburn was blamed for gathering cloths and articles of clothing utilized by yellow fever patients and sneaking them into the Northern states to be sold. The proof against Blackburn was impressive, albeit quite a bit of it was either conditional or given by observers of flawed notoriety. In spite of the fact that he was cleared by a Toronto court, open opinion was determinedly against him all through a great part of the United States. Today, history specialists still differ with regards to the quality of the proof supporting Blackburn's job in the supposed plot. Any plot of this nature was bound to bomb, be that as it may; in 1900, Walter Reed found that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.
