Toward the beginning of the twentieth century, the British Admiralty kept up that maritime guard of the British Empire, including the Dominions, ought to be brought together under the Royal Navy. Demeanors on this issue mollified amid the principal decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the production of 'Armada Units': powers comprising of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. Albeit some were to be worked by the Royal Navy at removed bases, especially in the Far East, the Dominions were urged to buy armada units to fill in as the center of new national naval forces: Australia and Canada were both urged to do as such at soonest opportunity, New Zealand was asked to halfway sponsor an armada unit for the China Station, and there were plans for South Africa to finance one at a future point. Each armada unit was structured as a "naval force in smaller than normal", and would work under the control of the obtaining Dominion amid peacetime. In case of across the board strife, the armada units would go under Admiralty control, and would be converged to frame bigger armadas for territorial barrier. Australia was the main Dominion to buy a full armada unit, and keeping in mind that the New Zealand-financed battlecruiser was given to the Royal Navy inside and out, no other country obtained dispatches under the armada unit plan.
