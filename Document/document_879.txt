Corner was viewed as an exquisite batsman who had an erect position at the wrinkle. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but rather to have a simple and loosened up style. In hockey, a player isn't permitted to lift his stick over the shoulders; this foundation fortified Booth's lower arms and wrists and empowered him to bestow energy on the ball without a vast swing of the cutting edge. Corner was especially known for his late cut and his spread drive, which he played in a way not at all like Mark Waugh. He was known for his brisk footwork against turn bowling and was once in a while puzzled, and he had the capacity to change his batting rhythm. Stall rapidly got into position and commonly moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181ÃÂ cm, weighed 66ÃÂ kg and abstained from smoking, betting and drinking. He was known for his productive outfielding, and on the second day of the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with solid tosses from the outfield. Stall began as low maintenance leg spinner before changing over to off turn.
