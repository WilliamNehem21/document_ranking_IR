Of land need, the RAAF's two northerly region directions were chiefly in charge of besieging and air protection, while different directions focussed on sea watch and hostile to submarine fighting. In light of an expansion in the quantity of Japanese submarines working in Australian waters, the RAAF directed serious watches along the east coast amid January and February 1943. This included in excess of 400 watch, against submarine, and caravan escort missions by Eastern Area flying machine in January. The submarine risk against Allied dispatching was viewed as sufficiently genuine to warrant basing more RAAF squadrons in southern directions than in the north, occupying assets from forward territories like New Guinea. By April, Eastern Area was working seven battle units: No.ÃÂ 5 Squadron, flying armed force collaboration missions with CAC Wirraways out of Kingaroy, Queensland; No.ÃÂ 23 Squadron, flying jump shelling missions with Wirraways from Lowood, Queensland; No.ÃÂ 24 Squadron, flying plunge besieging missions with Wirraways from Bankstown, New South Wales; No.ÃÂ 32 Squadron, flying observation and bombarding missions with Lockheed Hudsons from Camden, New South Wales; No.ÃÂ 71 Squadron, flying oceanic surveillance and against submarine missions with Avro Ansons from Lowood; No.ÃÂ 73 Squadron, flying sea observation and hostile to submarine missions with Ansons from Nowra, New South Wales; and No.ÃÂ 83 Squadron, flying contender missions with Wirraways from Strathpine, Queensland. Nos. 71 and 73 Squadrons were save arrangements quickly raised to enlarge the counter submarine exertion, manned by staff and understudies from operational preparing units.
