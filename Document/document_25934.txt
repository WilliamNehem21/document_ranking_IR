William Poole, in his 2009 edition of "The Man in the Moone", provides additional evidence for a later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got his knowledge of the Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of Samuel Purchass "Purchas his Pilgrimage". This book contains a redaction from Nicolas Trigault's "De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu" (1615) ("Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Poole also sees the influence of Robert Burton, who in the second volume of "The Anatomy of Melancholy" had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing for the first time in the 1628 edition of the "Anatomy" is a section on planetary periods, which gives a period for Mars of three yearsÂ â had Godwin used William Gilbert's "De Magnete" (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points to what he calls a "genetic debt": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the green children of Woolpit, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk.
