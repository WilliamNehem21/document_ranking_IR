The first two ships used Harvey armor for most of their armored vertical surfaces except for the gun turrets and their support tubes, which were made from Krupp armor. "Pobeda", however, used Krupp armor for all of her heavy vertical armor. Over the machinery spaces, the maximum thickness of their waterline armor belt was which reduced to abreast the magazines. The belt tapered to a thickness of over the machinery spaces and over the magazines. The belt covered of the ships' length and was high, of which the upper was intended to be above the waterline, but the ships were significantly overweight. So much of the belt was submerged that "Peresvet" only had of armor exposed at normal load; at full load the effect was even greater and the belt was completely submerged. "Oslyabya" was even more overweight and only had of her belt armor showing at normal load. The belt in both ships terminated in 7-inch transverse bulkheads, leaving the ends of the ships unprotected. The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in "Pobeda" were eliminated as the belt was extended to the ends of the ship with 4-inch armor plates. Above the waterline belt in all three ships was a shorter strake of armor that protected the middle of the ships. It was long and 4 inches thick. The ends of the upper belt were closed off by 4-inch angled transverse bulkheads.
