The Indians played against the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, however not at all like the 1948 Series, Feller did not show up. The Indians were cleared in four amusements by the Giants. Indians director Al LÃÂ³pez said of not beginning Feller, "I realize Feller needed to begin one of the recreations in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were cleared by the New York Giants), however we never truly discussed it ... In the event that we had won the first or second amusement in New York, I was going to begin Feller in Cleveland in the fourth diversion. Yet, when we didn't (win either amusement in New York), why in the hellfire would i say i was going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club around then, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (before in his profession)." In 1955, Feller spent piece of the period as a starter, at that point was moved to the warm up area later in the season. He won and lost four diversions each in 25 appearances. Amid the offseason, he progressed toward becoming administrator of the Ohio March of Dimes and filled in as player agent for the American League. He worked with National League delegate Robin Roberts all through the offseason, talking about the likelihood of player discretion and annuities with baseball proprietors; he at that point progressed toward becoming leader of the Baseball Players' Association.
