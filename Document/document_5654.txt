History specialist Joseph Ellis composes that "[t]he Adams administration was bound to be ruled by a solitary inquiry of American approach to a degree sometimes if at any time experienced by any succeeding tenant of the workplace." That question was whether to make war with France or discover harmony. In Europe, Britain and France were at war because of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the Federalists supported the British government against what they saw to be the political and hostile to religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm restriction to government, emphatically bolstered France. The French had upheld Jefferson for president and turned out to be significantly increasingly hostile at his misfortune. At the point when Adams entered office, he chose to proceed with Washington's strategy of avoiding the war. On account of the Jay Treaty, the French considered America to be Britain's lesser accomplice and started catching American vendor sends that were exchanging with the British. Most Americans were still professional French because of France's help amid the Revolution, the apparent mortification of the Jay Treaty, and their craving to help a republic against the British government, and would not endure war with France.
