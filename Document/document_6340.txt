For the content of his 2009 version, William Poole ordered a duplicate in the Bodleian Library Oxford (Ashm. 940(1)) with that in the British Library. The printer of the primary release of "The Man in the Moone" is distinguished on the cover sheet as John Norton, and the book was sold by Joshua Kirton and Thomas Warren. It likewise incorporates an epistle acquainting the work and ascribed with "E. M.", maybe the imaginary Edward Mahon recognized in the Stationers' Register as the interpreter from the first Spanish. Poole theorizes that this Edward Mahon may be Thomas or Morgan Godwin, two of the religious administrator's children who had worked with their dad on telecommunication, however includes that Godwin's third child, Paul, may be included also. The fractional amendment of the original copy (the principal half has dates as per the Gregorian logbook, the second half still pursues the supplanted Julian date-book) demonstrates an incomplete composition, which Paul may have gained after his dad's demise and passed on to his previous partner Joshua Kirton: Paul Godwin and Kirton were apprenticed to a similar printer, John Bill, and worked there together for a long time. Paul may have essentially proceeded the "E. M." deception unconsciously, as well as may have been in charge of fractional correction of the original copy. To the second release, distributed in 1657, was included Godwin's "Nuncius Inanimatus" (in English and Latin; first distributed in 1629). The third version was distributed in 1768; its content was compressed, and a depiction of St Helena (by printer Nathaniel Crouch) worked as a presentation.
