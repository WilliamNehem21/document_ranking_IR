Up to this time, Chapman had delighted in an amicable association with the Australian groups. In any case, in the match against Victoria which pursued the fourth Test, the group barracked the MCC group when Chapman expedited Harold Larwood, a quick bowler, to bowl against Bert Ironmonger, the number eleven, a strategy viewed as unsporting. As the group came back to the structure, Chapman was offended by individuals from the group amidst a minor fight. Potentially affected by these occasions, he pulled back from the last Test; sickness and his poor structure may likewise have been factors. As indicated by Lemmon, it was recommended in later years that Chapman did not play inferable from his overwhelming drinking. In his nonappearance, Australia won the fifth Test. After the fifth day of play and having played the two his innings, Jardine left to get a watercraft to India, for reasons which are hazy, and Chapman went about as his substitute in the field. Douglas takes note of that it looked like England "were attempting to double cross by picking their most grounded batting side (which implied dropping Chapman) without debilitating the handling (since Chapman was Jardine's substitute)." The Australians consented to the substitution depending on the prerequisite that Chapman did not field close to the batsmen.
