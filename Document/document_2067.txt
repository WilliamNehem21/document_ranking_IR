The name "Freedom Bell" or "Freedom Belle" is ordinarily utilized for business purposes, and has indicated brands and business names going from a disaster protection organization to a Montana escort administration. A vast blueprint of the chime hangs over the right-field grandstands at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball crew, and is lit up at whatever point one of their players hits a homer. This ringer plot supplanted one at the Phillies' previous home, Veterans Stadium. On April 1, 1996, Taco Bell declared by means of promotions and public statements that it had obtained the Liberty Bell and changed its name to the Taco Liberty Bell. The ringer, the advertisements related, would from this time forward go through a large portion of the year at Taco Bell corporate home office in Irvine, California. Shocked calls overwhelmed Independence National Historical Park, and Park Service authorities quickly called a question and answer session to deny that the chime had been sold. Following a few hours, Taco Bell conceded that it was an April Fools' Day joke. In spite of the dissents, organization offers of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos ascended by in excess of a half million dollars that week.
