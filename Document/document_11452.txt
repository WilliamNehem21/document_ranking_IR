The organism develops in a mycorrhizal relationship with deciduous trees, for example, oak, birch and beech on white soils. It is likewise associated with being a mycorrhizal partner of subshrub shake roses in the variety "Helianthemum". Field examines show that the parasite, when matched as a mycorrhizal cooperate with seedlings of the conifer "Cunninghamia lanceolata", expands the seedling's survival rate, enlarges its tallness and ground distance across, and builds the chlorophyll content in the leaves. A comparable development upgrading impact had been noted before with "Pinus taiwanensis" seedlings. These valuable impacts on plant development are a consequence of various associations among the organism, have plant, and indigenous soil microorganisms that expansion the biomass of carbon, and increment the bacterial assorted variety in the mycorrhizosphere. In an investigation contrasting the saltiness opposition of three basic ectomycorrhizal parasites (the others were "Suillus bovinus" and "S.ÃÂ luteus"), "S.ÃÂ luridus" was the most tolerant to high groupings of salt, and is a decent applicant animal types for the vaccination of tree seedlings to be planted on saline soil. Organic product bodies develop independently or dissipated on the ground, from June to November after summer downpours. "S.ÃÂ luridus" may happen in parks close to a solitary tree, however it won't be found in acidic soils.
