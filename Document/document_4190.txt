Portrayed as an "intuitive Beatles experience", the diversion was considered to convey players closer to the band through both specialized and enthusiastic methods. By playing every melody's particular note diagram, players were said to have a superior thankfulness for the structure and unpredictability of the sytheses and exhibitions by the Beatles. Inwardly, commentators remarked on the nostalgic estimations of the amusement's profession mode, reviewing the historical backdrop of the band. Faultfinders were for the most part positive concerning the visual and aural components of the amusement; G4's Abbie Heppe thought of it as a best bundle to the recently remastered collections, refering to melody explicit movements as a solid element. The dreamscape groupings specifically were compared to live exhibitions, commended as "stunning" and "reminiscent". In any case, Schiesel commented that because of the players' fixation on the note tracks, the livelinesss "serve generally to engage spectators instead of the players themselves". Heppe saw that the shading immersion of the foundation components just as the "Beatlemania" enhanced visualizations can here and there balance inadequately with the looking over notes, making it hard to play. After the diversion's discharge, Harmonix lead planner Chris Foster recognized that the visuals can be "unreasonably overpowering for [some players] at minutes". The execution of three-section harmonies, communicated by some to be the most noteworthy expansion to the arrangement, was generally welcomed.
