David Hodgson of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" ("EGM") found "Deathrow" European origins apparent as "awkward, over-the-top expletives in obnoxious American accents" were paired with rugby. Hodgson said that "Deathrow" struggled to show grittiness in a very shiny environment. He added that the game suffered from immoderate violence, frustrating fighting sequences, lack of online play, and "steep learning curve". Hodgson compared the core mechanics to a "mini-game masquerading as sports entertainment". William Racer of the "Official Xbox Magazine" ("OXM") praised the fast-paced nature of the game and its eye for detail, and complained about the camera angles and difficulty. He placed the game in a lineage of invented sports from a dystopian future and found the game more entertaining than the rest. Racer also found the music generic, and the voice acting good. Eric Bush of "TeamXbox" complimented the computer opponents's artificial intelligence and said that they put up a challenge. "GameSpy" Osborne appreciated the game's small details like the streak trailing the disc through the air. IGN's Kaiser Hwang called the arena lighting effects, bump mapping, and textures the best since "". 1UP.com, "OXM" Racer, and IGN's Douglass Perry and David Clayman recommended "Deathrow" as a party game, with the IGN staff specifically recommending the game with System Link.
