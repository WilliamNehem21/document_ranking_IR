"Chesapeake"s nominal rating is stated as either 36 or 38Â guns. Originally designated as a 44-gun ship, her redesign by Fox led to a rerating, apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to "Congress" and "Constellation". Joshua Humphreys may have rerated "Chesapeake" to 38Â guns, or Secretary Stoddert rerated "Congress" and "Constellation" to 38 guns because they were larger than "Chesapeake", which was rated to 36 guns. The most recent information on her rating is from the "Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships", which states she was rerated "from 44Â guns to 36, eventually increased to 38". Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career; Fox used a 44-gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44-gun ship. Hamilton was corrected by William Bainbridge in a letter stating, "There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the "Chesapeake", as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun frigates, whereas the "Chesapeake" is of the class of the "Congress" and "Constellation"." Lastly, when sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819, she was rated as a 48-gun ship.
