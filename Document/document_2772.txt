In reptiles, highlights of the scales are essential in recognizing among species and gatherings of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (situated over the nose) are in contact, just like the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in many people. The two frontoparietal scales (above and somewhat behind the eyes) are not melded. Not at all like in "T.ÃÂ maculata", the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with one another. There are four supraocular scales (over the eyes) in practically all examples and five supraciliary scales (promptly over the eyes, underneath the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two less than in "T.ÃÂ maculata". There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (checked around the body halfway between the fore-and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63Ã¢ÂÂ 64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). "Mabuya" species and "T.ÃÂ maculata" for the most part have less midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29ÃÂ subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in "T.ÃÂ maculata", which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26ÃÂ presacral vertebrae (situated before the sacrum), like most "Trachylepis", however not at all like American "Mabuya", which have no less than 28.
