Around the year 150 CE, the Greek stargazer of the Roman time frame Claudius Ptolemy portrayed Sirius as rosy, alongside five different stars, Betelgeuse, Antares, Aldebaran, Arcturus and Pollux, which are all of orange or red tint. The inconsistency was first noted by beginner space expert Thomas Barker, squire of Lyndon Hall in Rutland, who arranged a paper and talked at a gathering of the Royal Society in London in 1760. The presence of different stars changing in brilliance offered validity to the possibility that some may change in shading as well; Sir John Herschel noticed this in 1839, perhaps affected by seeing Eta Carinae two years sooner. Thomas Jefferson Jackson See restored dialog on red Sirius with the distribution of a few papers in 1892, and a last synopsis in 1926. He refered to Ptolemy as well as the artist Aratus, the speaker Cicero, and general Germanicus as calling the star red, however recognizing that none of the last three creators were space experts, the last two simply interpreting Aratus' ballad "Phaenomena". Seneca had depicted Sirius as being of a more profound red than Mars. Not every old onlooker considered Sirius to be red. The first century writer Marcus Manilius depicted it as "ocean blue", as did the fourth century Avienus. It was the standard white star in antiquated China, and various records from the second century BCE up to the seventh century CE all portray Sirius as white.
