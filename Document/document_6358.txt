An "impassioned Republican", Jack Warner in any case bolstered President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the mid 1930s. Later in the decade, he made basic reason with rivals of Nazi Germany, neglecting ideological contrasts with the individuals who held liberal political perspectives. In 1947, in any case, Warner filled in as a "well disposed observer" for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), along these lines loaning backing to claims of a "Red" invasion of Hollywood. Warner felt that Communists were in charge of the studio's month-long strike that happened in the fall of 1946, and all alone activity, he gave the names of twelve screenwriters who were rejected as a result of suspected Communist feelings, a move that adequately crushed their professions. Previous studio workers named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw. As one biographer watched, Warner "was angry when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined different individuals from the excellent Committee for the First Amendment in a trip to Washington to lecture against the risk to free articulation". Lester D. Friedman noticed that Warner's reaction to the HUAC hearings was like other Jewish studio heads who "expected that a sweeping condition of Communists with Jews would decimate them and their industry".
