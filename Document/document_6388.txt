Spanish "el Pelele"), additionally interpreted as the Idiot by certain pundits, seems just in the initial four sections and again toward the finish of part seven however serves a basic capacity in the novel. The Zany, who "resembled a cadaver when he was sleeping" and had eyes that "saw nothing, believed nothing" is basic to building up the tone of the novel and setting off the novel's activity. Faultfinder John Walker contends that, by "picking the Idiot as an agent of the blameless, the a-political, who endure the maltreatment of an extremist routine [...] Asturias demonstrates how tyranny undermines individuals and demolishes their qualities to the degree that empathy for one's partner in trouble stops to exist." actually, it turns out to be certain that the main bliss that the Zany encounters is through the memory of his dead mother.

Besides, "el Pelele" is an instrument that enables perusers to see the mental impacts of living under a tyranny controlled by dread. His lethal demonstration appears to trigger the ensuing occasions of the novel and to affect on every one of the characters.
