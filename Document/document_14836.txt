Regardless of their concurrence on Samoa, quite a bit of Bayard's term of office was taken up in settling debate with Great Britain. The biggest of these concerned the Canadian fisheries off the Atlantic shorelines of Canada and Newfoundland. The privileges of American angler in Canadian waters had been questioned since American freedom, yet the latest difference originated from Congress' choice in 1885 to annul some portion of the 1871 bargain that administered the circumstance. Under that arrangement, American anglers reserved the privilege to angle in Canadian waters; consequently, anglers from Canada and Newfoundland reserved the option to send out fish to the United States obligation free. Protectionists in Congress thought the course of action hurt American angler, and persuaded their partners to revoke it. Accordingly, Canadian experts fell back on an elucidation of the prior Treaty of 1818, and started to catch American vessels. In 1887, the intermediary 49th Congress at that point passed the Fisheries Retaliation Act, which engaged the president to ban Canadian boats from American ports on the off chance that he thought Canadians were treating American anglers "treacherously;" Cleveland marked the bill, however did not uphold it and trusted he and Bayard would most likely locate a conciliatory answer for the raising exchange war.
