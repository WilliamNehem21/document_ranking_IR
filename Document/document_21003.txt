In service, the "Pennsylvania"-class saw limited use in the First World War, as a shortage of oil fuel in the United Kingdom meant that only the coal-burning ships of Battleship Division Nine were sent. Both were sent across the Atlantic to France after the war for the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and were then transferred to the Pacific Fleet before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931. For the remainder of the inter-war period, the ships were used in exercises and fleet problems. Both "Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" were present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into the Second World War. "Arizona" was sunk by a massive magazine explosion and was turned into a memorial after the war, while "Pennsylvania", in dry dock at the time, received only minor damage. After a refit from October 1942 to February 1943, "Pennsylvania" went on to serve as a shore bombardment ship for most of the remainder of the war. "Pennsylvania" was present at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battle ever between battleships, but did not engage. "Pennsylvania" was severely damaged by a torpedo on 12 August 1945, two days before the cessation of hostilities. With minimal repairs, it was used in Operation "Crossroads", part of the nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll, before being expended as a target ship in 1948.
