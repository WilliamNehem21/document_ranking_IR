Billy Vaughn secured "Here We Go Again" on his 1967 "Tribute to Billy Joe" instrumental collection, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 collection "My Woman, My Woman, My Wife". Glen Campbell's adaptation showed up on his 1971 collection "The Last Time I Saw Her", Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 collection "Desolate People", and George Strait's on his 1992 collection "Standing My Ground". Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 "Here We Go Again" collection, however she did exclude it on her 2007 two part harmonies collection "", which was discharged a month later. Their joint effort was positively checked on, and McEntire was said to revitalize this nation standard by Nathalie Baret of "ABQ Journal". Martin's variant was 3:07, and it later showed up on gathering collections, beginning with the 1996 "Senior member Martin Gold, Vol. 2". It has showed up on a bunch of other Martin assemblage collections. Campbell's adaptation was just 2:26. Strait's form is 2:53 and seems later on his 2004 "Biggest Collection" at a 2:55 length. Steagall's rendition with McEntire (who Steagall found at a 1974 area reasonable) is 3:10. R&B and boogie-woogie musician and artist Little Willie Littlefield recorded a rendition for his 1997 collection "The Red One". Subsides and Lee made a form of the melody on their 1976 on their "Serenade" collection. Joe Dolan delivered a 1972 single of the tune that he included on his 1976 collection "Brilliant Hour Of Joe Dolan Vol. 2" and a few of his most prominent hits collections.
