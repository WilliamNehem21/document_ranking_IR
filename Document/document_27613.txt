Many theories have been developed to explain the film's ambiguous ending. Dean Cundey deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of the uninfected characters. In an interview with Blumhouse he said, "There's always an eye light, we call it, a little gleam in the eye of the actor. It gives life." Other theories seize on the lack of visible breath from Childs in the Antarctic air, although this has been explained as an issue with the scene lighting. Keith David said, "When I watched it again, I wouldnât doubt â Iâve never asked, I havenât seen John [Carpenter], but the next time I see John I want to ask him, âHow much of that was put in post?â Everything [Kurt] says, you see some smoke. Of course, now I see it. Conspicuously, thereâs none coming out of mine.â Another theory postulates that the bottle that MacReady gives to Childs is actually a leftover molotov cocktail and thus contains gasoline. Regarding this theory, Kurt Russell has said, âJohn Carpenter and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didnât know anything." Carpenter summarised, "Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you."
