Bracket features the significance that Gibbons puts on separation as an important aide to compelling composition: "In the same way as other a decent specialist, she appears to have looked at compassion as a particular and repetitive feeling, and a horrible exercise in futility." This obvious truth quality in her exposition may, as per Gibbons' "Gatekeeper" obituarist Richard Boston, be a response against the tempestuous and once in a while brutal feelings that she saw inside her own family who, she stated, "were all frantically profoundly sexed, similar to the Starkadders". It is, watched Neville, an incongruity that the overheated acting that Gibbons most loathed was at the core of her one incredible achievement; Gibbons' compositions on regular day to day existence brought her controlled endorsement, yet no discernible abstract acknowledgment. All things considered, her clear, style, unadorned with the exception of in satire, is respected by Rachel Cooke, who commends her as "a sworn foe of the bombastic, the grandiose and the too much wistful." While shy of wistfulness, Gibbons' composition, in writing or stanza, did not need affectability. She had what one investigator depicted as "an uncommon capacity to go into the sentiments of the uncommunicative and to enliven the feelings of the unremarkable".
