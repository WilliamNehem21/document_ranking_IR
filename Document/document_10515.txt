As the selections for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards drew closer, early media reports named "Genuine Detective" among a few potential miniseries competitors, because of an amendment made by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences that perceived film and miniseries content as particular classes. By March 2014, HBO had submitted "Genuine Detective" as a dramatization arrangement contender, an offbeat move given the show's collection design and savage challenge from any semblance of "Breaking Bad" and "Place of Cards". HBO's choice was rebuffed by FX president John Landgraf, who commented to journalists at a press occasion: "My very own perspective is that a miniseries is a story that closes, an arrangement is a story that proceeds. To disclose to you reality, I believe it's really uncalled for HBO to put "Genuine Detective" in the dramatization arrangement classification in light of the fact that basically you can get certain performing artists to complete a shut finished arrangement Ã¢ÂÂ a la Billy Bob Thornton in "Fargo" or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in "Genuine Detective" Ã¢ÂÂ who you can't get the opportunity to sign on for a seven-year [regular show series] bargain." Nevertheless, "Genuine Detective" developed as a leader heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was assigned for twelve honors; its nearest rival, "Breaking Bad", got sixteen selections. The arrangement at last won five Emmy grants: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.
