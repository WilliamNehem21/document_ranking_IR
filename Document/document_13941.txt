On board the "Orion", a wooden close was crushed off one of the ship's poles, executing two men before injuring Captain Saumarez in the thigh. On "Peuple Souverain", Captain Pierre-Paul Raccord was severely injured and requested his ship's stay link slice with an end goal to get away from the assault. "Peuple Souverain" floated south towards the lead "Arrange", which erroneously started shooting at the obscured vessel. "Orion" and "Protection" were unfit to quickly seek after. "Resistance" had lost its fore topmast and an ad libbed fireship that floated through the fight barely missed "Orion". The root of this vessel, a deserted and consuming boat's watercraft loaded down with profoundly combustible material, is unsure, however it might have been propelled from "Guerrier" as the fight started. "Peuple Souverain" secured not a long way from "Arrange", yet took no further part in the battling. The destroyed ship surrendered amid the night. "Franklin" stayed in battle, however Blanquet had endured a serious head wound and Captain Gillet had been conveyed beneath oblivious with extreme injuries. Instantly a while later, a flame broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms storage detonated, which was in the end doused with trouble by the group.
