There have been insistences and analysis of Havelock's techniques. His record of orality is put together on the whole with respect to Homer, yet the historical backdrop of the Homeric content isn't known, which powers Havelock to make claims dependent on presumptions that can't completely be tried. Crafted by Milman Parry on Homer were instrumental in building up the introduction to his work, and the achievement supported research which Havelock arranged. The "Repel Lord proposition" was presented by Rosalind Thomas, to clear up the import of this methodology. Some later classicists contend that the beautiful idea of Homer's language neutralizes the very contentions Havelock makes about the scholarly idea of oral verse. What he attests as an authoritative utilization of language can never be decisively shown not to be a mishap of "metrical accommodation." Homerists, similar to Platonists, observed the book to be not exactly valuable for the exact work of their own order; numerous classicists dismissed by and large Havelock's fundamental theory that oral culture prevailed through the fifth century. In the meantime, however, Havelock's impact, especially in artistic hypothesis, was developing colossally. He is the most refered to author in Walter J. Ong's powerful "Orality and Literacy" other than Ong himself. His work has been refered to in investigations of orality and education in African culture and the ramifications of present day proficiency hypothesis for library science. "Introduction to Plato" has remained consistently in print since its underlying production.
