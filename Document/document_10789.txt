Hancock at long last accomplished a battle order in January 1945, when he assumed responsibility for No.ÃÂ 100 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort light planes amid the Aitape-Wewak crusade in New Guinea. That month, the unit assaulted Japanese positions at Maprik, underneath the Prince Alexander Ranges, and Cape Moem, close Wewak. On 1ÃÂ April, Hancock took over No.ÃÂ 71 Wing, which went under generally speaking control of RAAF Northern Command and ostensibly included Nos.ÃÂ 7, 8 and 100 Beaufort Squadrons, just as a trip of CAC Boomerang contender aircraft from No.ÃÂ 4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron. It was before long expanded by two more Beaufort units, Nos.ÃÂ 6 and 15 Squadrons. Giving close air backing to Australian ground troops in the number one spot up to the last attack on Wewak, the wing flew more than 1,400 fights and dropped in excess of 1,200 tons of bombs in May alone. By mid-year, Hancock's powers were intensely shy of fuel and weapons, to the degree that his squadrons took to equipping their Beauforts with caught Japanese bombs. In July, enough supplies landed to empower the wing to keep working at ordinary quality. No.ÃÂ 71 Wing was dynamic to the absolute a day ago of the Pacific War, flying its last battle mission including 30 Beauforts just hours before updates on triumph landed on 15ÃÂ August 1945. Hancock's "recognized flying on tasks in Northern Command" earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross; the honor was distributed in the "London Gazette" on 22ÃÂ February 1946.
