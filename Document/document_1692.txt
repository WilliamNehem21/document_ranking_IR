The third and most significant issue concerned the ruler's top choice, Piers Gaveston. Gaveston was a Gascon of generally humble causes, with whom the lord had built up an especially cozy relationship. Among the distinctions Edward stored upon Gaveston was the earldom of Cornwall, a title which had already just been given on individuals from the imperial family. The special treatment of an upstart like Gaveston, in mix with his conduct that was viewed as presumptuous, prompted disdain among the built up friends of the domain. This hatred initially rose to the top in a presentation written in Boulogne by a gathering of magnates who were with the lord when he was in France for his wedding service to the French ruler's little girl. The alleged Boulogne understanding was dubious, yet it communicated clear worry over the condition of the imperial court. On 25 February 1308, the new lord was delegated. The pledge he was made to take at the royal celebration varied from that of past lords in the fourth provision; here Edward was required to guarantee to keep up the laws that the network "will have picked" (""air eslu""). In spite of the fact that it is vague what precisely was implied by this wording at the time, this pledge was later utilized in the battle between the ruler and his lords.
