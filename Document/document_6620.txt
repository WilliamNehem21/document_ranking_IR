Aaliyah's re-development with the collection in mid-2001 had concurred with a time of pinnacle action in contemporary R&B, just as the prominence of neo soul. As indicated by Erlewine, "Aaliyah" was "one of the most grounded urban soul records of now is the right time", while "The Guardian" refered to it as the pinnacle of R&B's brilliant age "when the new century rolled over". Alexis Petridis, the paper's lead faultfinder, trusted Aaliyah had recorded her most captivating music in a year when R&B and hip jump exhibited the most inventiveness in prominent music. "The Guardian"s Rebecca Nicholson ascribed Timbaland's consequent business accomplishment with artists, for example, Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado to his experience delivering "Aaliyah", composing that he "hasn't verged on making anything as sonically shocking since". In spite of the fact that Jon Caramanica from "Vibe" trusted it "reclassifies the class", he said "Aaliyah" "might be the best soul collection of the youthful millenium", calling its music "brave in development, exquisite from conceptionÃÂ ... damn close post-R&B". "Q" writer Eve Barlow credited the collection for "making an outline that can be heard crosswise over popular music today" with acts, for example, R&B vocalists BeyoncÃÂ© and The Weeknd, and outside the box pop band The xx.
