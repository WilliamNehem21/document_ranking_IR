In 1985, two volunteer field gatherers for "The Banksia Atlas" venture, John and Lalage Falconer of Esperance, ended up persuaded that there were three "Banksia" species as opposed to two at Point Culver. Coming back to the area on 9 January 1986, they gathered leaves and old blooms of what they thought was an undescribed species. The examples did in reality recommend that another species had been found, however they were not adequate for formal distribution. Right on time in May the next year, John Falconer drove more than 2000 kilometers on unlocked tracks from Warburton to Point Culver and back once more, so as to gather new blooms and product of the indicated new species. Alex George at that point started setting up a formal portrayal of the species. Amid his exploration, he found that Nelson's Toolinna Cove example was likewise referable to the undescribed species. Without any veritable "B.ÃÂ media" examples from Toolinna Cove, George derived that just "B.ÃÂ epica" happened there, and that Eyre more likely than not located "B.ÃÂ epica" in 1841. In 1988, he distributed a formal depiction of the species, naming it "Banksia epica" in reference to the two "epic" voyages of Eyre and Falconer. Accordingly the species' full name is "Banksia epica" A.S.George. It was later settled that both "B.ÃÂ epica" and "B.ÃÂ media" happen at Toolinna Cove.
