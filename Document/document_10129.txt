In Operation Crusader, the seventh Armored Division was entrusted with finding and obliterating the Axis covering, and the second Royal Gloucestershire Hussars was the lead component of the 22nd Armored Brigade's development. On 19ÃÂ November, the unit experienced the Italian Ariete Division, and in the resulting First Battle of Bir el Gubi it lost 40 tanks.
