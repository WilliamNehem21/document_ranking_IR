During late October and November 1943, the battalion was engaged in anti-partisan operations around Å½aga (Saga) and Kobarid (Karfreit), including Operation "Traufe" (Eaves). In late November, it was placed under the command of the Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy, "SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer und General der Waffen-SS" (Lieutenant General) Karl Wolff for an operation. In February 1944, the battalion conducted Operation "Ratte" (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of Komen and Branik (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including "Zypresse" (Cypress), "MÃ¤rzveilchen" (Violet), "Maulwurf" (Mole) and "Hellblau" (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation "Osterglocke" (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation "Liane" in late May, and the long-running Operation "Annemarie" which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of Cividale del Friuli. Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.
