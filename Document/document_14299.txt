The estimation of the maritime base was soon obvious when the First World War broke out in August 1914. Just a couple of minutes after the affirmation of war became effective at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was caught by a torpedo pontoon from Gibraltar, trailed by three more foe transports the next day. In spite of the fact that Gibraltar was well far from the primary front lines of the war Ã¢ÂÂ Spain stayed nonpartisan and the Mediterranean was not challenged as it was in the Second World WarÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ it assumed a vital job in the Allied battle against the German U-pontoon crusade. The maritime base was vigorously utilized by Allied warships for resupplying and fixes. The Bay of Gibraltar was likewise utilized as a framing up point for Allied escorts, while German U-pontoons stalked the Strait searching for targets. On two events, Gibraltar's firearms fruitlessly terminated on two U-water crafts going through the Strait. Against submarine fighting was in its earliest stages and it demonstrated difficult to forestall U-pontoons working through the Strait. Just two days before the finish of the war, on 9 November 1918, SM "UB-50" torpedoed and sank the British ship HMS "Britannia" off Cape Trafalgar toward the west of Gibraltar.
