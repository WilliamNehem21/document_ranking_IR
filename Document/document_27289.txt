Olivia became concerned about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You told me you were prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own wayÂ ... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to youâbut she obviously can't marry youâit's hardly "decent"! There's another point tooâwhich is the personal inconvenience & bother to myselfâI had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see herÂ ... She must marryâShe & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically Ã  deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separateÂ ... You ought to go awayâEnglishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had â¤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her!
