The Coonleys moved to Washington, D.C. in 1916, and keeping in mind that Queene kept on dedicating her time and cash, she left the everyday course of the school to Morse. Under her heading, the Junior Elementary School based upon the instructive establishments built up at the Cottage School, with its attention on the dynamic support of the understudies. Show, music, and move were vital pieces of the educational programs, and nature consider remained an indispensable part of understudies' exercises. These thoughts, and nature consider specifically, were generally the production of Colonel Francis Wayland Parker, whom John Dewey once alluded to as "the dad of dynamic instruction". The Junior Elementary School was a demonstrating ground for these standards, which required another method for identifying with understudies, enabling them to openly encounter their exercises alone terms. No refinement was made among young men's and young ladies' exercises, which included cultivating, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley reviewed that "[w]e had young men and young ladies. We saw no difference, young men and young ladies cooked, young men and young ladies carpentered work, young men and young ladies took an equivalent part in all issues of government." Students re-sanctioned history and writing, created their own music, and invested quite a bit of their energy outside. In 1924, Coonley and Morse helped found a diary entitled "Dynamic Education", in which they distributed their own down to earth encounters at the school, joined by articles composed by driving instructive scholars, including John Dewey. It turned into the main expert diary of the dynamic training development and was distributed until 1957.
