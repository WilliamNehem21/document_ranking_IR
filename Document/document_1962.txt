All named types of "Plateosaurus" aside from the sort species and "P.ÃÂ gracilis" have ended up being junior equivalent words of the sort species or invalid names. Von Huene for all intents and purposes raised another species and now and again another sort for each generally total find from Trossingen (three types of "Pachysaurus" and seven of "Plateosaurus") and Halberstadt (one types of "Gresslyosaurus" and eight of "Plateosaurus"). Afterward, he blended a few of these animal groups, however stayed persuaded that more than one class and more than one types of "Plateosaurus" was available in the two areas. Jaekel likewise trusted that the Halberstadt material incorporated a few plateosaurid dinosaurs, just as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. Methodical research by Galton radically diminished the quantity of genera and species. Galton synonymised all cranial material, and depicted contrasts between the syntypes of "P.ÃÂ engelhardti" and the Trossingen material, which he alluded to "P.ÃÂ longiceps". Galton perceived "P.ÃÂ trossingensis" ("P.ÃÂ fraasianus" and "P.ÃÂ integer" are junior target equivalent words) to be indistinguishable to "P.ÃÂ longiceps". Markus Moser, in any case, demonstrated that "P.ÃÂ longiceps" is itself a lesser equivalent word of "P.ÃÂ engelhardti". Moreover, an assortment of species in other genera were made for material having a place with "P.ÃÂ engelhardti", including "Dimodosaurus poligniensis", "Gresslyosaurus robustus", "Gresslyosaurus torgeri", "Pachysaurus ajax", "Pachysaurus giganteus", "Pachysaurus magnus" and "Pachysaurus wetzelianus".
