York began 2012Ã¢ÂÂ 13 by winning five of 14 coordinates, and were ninth in the table by late October 2012. They dropped down the table in the next months, yet were still in conflict for a play-off spot subsequent to beating Burton Albion 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0 in the New Year. After this match, York neglected to win 11 continuous matches, and Mills was expelled in March 2013 after a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 0 home thrashing to Bradford City. Under his substitution, previous Northern Ireland chief Nigel Worthington, York dodged transfer by winning four of their last five matches. They completed their first League Two season in seventeenth spot. York won just four of their initial 23 matches of 2013Ã¢ÂÂ 14, and were third from the base of the table by late December 2013. Various compelling signings in January 2014 helped York improve their structure, and from early February they were unbeaten in 17 back to back matches, yielding no objectives from open play. York completed in seventh spot and played Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-last. Subsequent to losing the principal leg 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 at home, York drew 0Ã¢ÂÂ 0 at Highbury Stadium in the second leg. Worthington surrendered as supervisor in October 2014 after York won just a single of their opening 14 matches of 2014Ã¢ÂÂ 15. He was prevailing by previous Scunthorpe United administrator Russ Wilcox. York stayed in the lower ranges of the table. They maintained a strategic distance from transfer with a late-season keep running of four successes from five matches, completing the season in eighteenth spot.
