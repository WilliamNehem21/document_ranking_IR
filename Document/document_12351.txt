"Kaiser Friedrich III" was told by "KÃÂ¤pitan zur See" Alfred Begas. The V Squadron was entrusted with giving waterfront resistance in the North Sea. The boats were conveyed to the Baltic twice, from 19 to 26 September and 26 to 30 December 1914. For the main task, the officer of maritime powers in the Baltic, Prince Heinrich, at first wanted to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable attack on Windau, yet a deficiency of transports constrained a modification of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival constrain, however this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her sisters came back to Kiel the next day, where the arrival compel landed. The boats at that point continued toward the North Sea, where they continued watchman transport obligations. For their second organization to the Baltic, Prince Heinrich requested a raid toward Gotland to assault Russian warships that may be in the zone.
