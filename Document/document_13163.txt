The Bicentennial Committee needed a memorial Washington half dollar, and looked to alleviate Hoover's worries by recommending that each of the 1932 half dollars portray Washington as opposed to bearing the typical Walking Liberty plan. The Depression had diminished interest for coin in business; no half dollars had been struck in 1930, and none would be until 1933. Most memorial coins at the time were struck in an amount of a couple of thousand. The half dollar was viewed as the biggest and most conspicuous structureÃ¢ÂÂthe Peace dollar was not then being struck and did not flow in a significant part of the nation. Different commemoratives had been sold including some built-in costs, the Washington half dollar would, for one year, be the ordinary Mint issue. Despite the fact that it had not yet gotten congressional endorsement, the board of trustees felt free to start a challenge. The board of trustees foreseen that a similar craftsman would initially plan the council's decoration and after that the coin. The front of both decoration and coin were to be founded on the notable figure of Washington (1786) by French artist Jean-Antoine Houdon; the craftsman was not confined with regards to the turn around plan. By law, coinage structures were endorsed by the Secretary of the Treasury, around then Andrew W. Mellon, a prominent craftsmanship gatherer and epicurean; it was foreseen he would intervene no protest to the arrangement.
