No. 1 Squadron started accepting new Demons in November 1936. In January 1937, it surrendered its Bulldogs to No.ÃÂ 21 Squadron, which was to hold them until they could be exchanged to the destined to-be-shaped No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron. Before the finish of February, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron's quality was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 aviators. The unit was redesignated No.ÃÂ 1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937. Towards the year's end, it was tormented by a few Demon mishaps, bringing about a progression of request and a survey of RAAF systems in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF Sir Edward Ellington; the supposed Ellington Report and its analysis of air wellbeing principles prompted the expulsion of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his situation as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the arrangement of the Air Force. No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron got the RAAF's initial three CAC Wirraways on 10ÃÂ July 1939. As the probability of war expanded, the squadron's job was modified to join surveillance just as bombarding, bringing about the exchange out everything being equal and Wirraways and the move in from different units of nine Avro Ansons on 28Ã¢ÂÂ 29 August 1939; toward the month's end its work force contained nine officers and 122 pilots.
