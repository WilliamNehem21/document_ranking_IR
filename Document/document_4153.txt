One well known speculation proposed that pinnipeds are diphyletic (slipped from two genealogical lines), with walruses and otariids offering an ongoing normal predecessor to bears and phocids imparting one to Musteloidea. Be that as it may, morphological and sub-atomic proof help a monophyletic inception. In any case, there is some question regarding whether pinnipeds are all the more firmly identified with bears or musteloids, as certain examinations bolster the previous hypothesis and others the last mentioned. Pinnipeds split from different caniforms 50 million years back (mya) amid the Eocene. Their developmental connect to earthly well evolved creatures was obscure until the 2007 revelation of "Puijila darwini" in early Miocene stores in Nunavut, Canada. Like a cutting edge otter, "Puijila" had a long tail, short appendages and webbed feet rather than flippers. In any case, its appendages and shoulders were progressively strong and "Puijila" likely had been a quadrupedal swimmerÃ¢ÂÂholding a type of amphibian motion that offer ascent to the real swimming sorts utilized by current pinnipeds. The analysts who discovered "Puijila" set it in a clade with "Potamotherium" (customarily thought about a mustelid) and "Enaliarctos". Of the three, "Puijila" was the least particular for sea-going life. The revelation of "Puijila" in a lake store proposes that pinniped development experienced a freshwater transitional stage.
