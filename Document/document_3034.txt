Murdoch had before prescribed Hannah, known to be a solid backer for Australian support in the Vietnam War, for the situation of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for pivot toward the finish of 1969; the post went to an Army officer, and the Federal government requested the withdrawal of the RAAF nearness in Vietnam amid Hannah's visit as CAS. In March 1970, the Minister for Defense, Malcolm Fraser, authorized a survey of maritime air control. Hannah on a very basic level couldn't help contradicting any proposal that the Royal Australian Navy ought to work land-based flying machine, guaranteeing that he was contending not from a factional point of view but rather to guarantee that Australia's constrained resistance assets were not spread crosswise over three administrations.
