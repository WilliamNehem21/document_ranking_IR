Since its legalization in 2005, couples from across section of Spanish society have entered into same-sex marriages. Within the first year the law received royal assent, influential Socialist Leader and Madrid City Councilor Pedro Zerolo married JesÃºs Santos in January, and popular television presenter JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez married Roberto CortÃ©s in March. In October 2005, Spain's prominent anti-terrorism judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska married his fiancÃ© Gorka GÃ³mez. In August 2006, Ourense City Councilor and member of the People's Party Pepe Araujo, whose party originally opposed the law, married his fiancÃ© Nino Crespo. In September 2006, Alberto Linero Marchena and Alberto SÃ¡nchez FernÃ¡ndez, both army soldiers assigned to the MorÃ³n Air Base near Seville, became Spain's first military personnel to marry under the new law. In August 2008, DoÃ±a Luisa Isabel Ãlvarez de Toledo, 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia and three-time Grandee of Spain (branded the "Red Duchess" for her socialist activism), became the highest ranking Spanish noble to marry in an "articulo mortis" (deathbed) wedding to longtime companion Liliana Maria Dahlmann, now the Dowager Duchess of Medina Sidonia by right of her late wife. In June 2015, the then Mayor of the Basque capital Vitoria-Gasteiz, Javier Maroto, announced his engagement to longtime partner Josema RodrÃ­guez. The wedding was held on 18 September 2015 at Vitoria's City Hall. Maroto, a member of the conservative People's Party's national board, is known for his views contrary to the stance of his own party pertaining to same-sex marriage in Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had challenged the law approving same-sex marriage when he was Opposition Leader, attended the wedding celebrations as a guest.
