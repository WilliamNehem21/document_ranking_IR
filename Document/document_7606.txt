By June 1943, McLachlan had been advanced gathering commander and given order of No.ÃÂ 73 Wing. He set up his central command at Goodenough Island, where he was in charge of sorting out the wing into a contender arrangement comprising of No.ÃÂ 76 Squadron (Kittyhawks), No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron (Spitfires). Just as giving nearby air barrier, and contender escort for Australian aircraft, the Kittyhawks were outfitted with ignitable and universally useful bombs so they could take part in ground assault missions, a training that had just been utilized by Commonwealth powers in the Middle Eastern theater. In August, the wing exchanged to Kiriwina, while No.ÃÂ 9 Group's other battle arrangement, No.ÃÂ 71 Wing, took over duty regarding Goodenough. Delegated senior air staff officer (SASO) at No.ÃÂ 9 Group, McLachlan gave over direction of No.ÃÂ 73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943. Towards the finish of his presenting on No.ÃÂ 9 Group, McLachlan told its previous authority, Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, that the USAAF was "jumping ahead" of the RAAF, which was by and large left to "tidy up the leftovers" of Japanese opposition. He expected that Australian military pilots particularly would be "progressively anxious if the Americans took all the battling plums". Scarcely a year later, spirit among senior RAAF military pilots had dropped to such a degree, that eight of them endeavored to leave their bonuses in the purported "Morotai Mutiny".
