Trost started an Indiegogo fundraising campaign seeking $100,000 in February 2016, revealing the title to be "Beats of Rage: The FP Part II". The campaign received over $19,000 in donations by its end, with the amount raised below the fundraising goal to finish a third of the film. In July 2017, Trost started another Indiegogo campaign to finish the film, now titled "Beats of Rage: The FP 2". The first thirty minutes of the film had already been shot at the time of the posting, and the fundraising goal was set at $20,000, which was surpassed with over $34,000 donated. In April 2018, a synopsis and poster were released for the film, now simply titled "Beats of Rage". The film follows the events of "The FP", and features Trost, Hsu, Barrera, and Principe reprising their roles from the first film, alongside new cast members Mike O'Gorman, Tallay Wickham, and Bru Miller. "Beats of Rage" will again feature JTRO and KCDC trying to save the world from an alcohol withdrawal by competing in the titular "Beat-Beat Revelation" tournament against AK-47, the leader of The Wastes. Trost also said that the film will debut at "a major U.S. genre festival" in October 2018. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2018, again retitled "".
