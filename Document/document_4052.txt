Due to the condition of the connection between the two organizations the MS&LR was despondent being entirely dependent on the Met for access to London and, in contrast to its railroad toward the north, south of Aylesbury there were a few speed confinements and long ascensions, up to 1 of every 90 in spots. In 1898, the MS&LR and the GWR together displayed a bill to Parliament for a railroad (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short interfacing branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met challenged, guaranteeing that the bill was 'contrary with the soul and terms' of the understandings among it and the MS&LR. The MS&LR was offered expert to continue, yet the Met was given the privilege to remuneration. An impermanent understanding was made to permit four MS&LR coal prepares multi day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS&LR wished these trains to likewise utilize the GWR course from Aylesbury by means of Princes Risborough into London, while the Met considered this was not secured by the understanding. A train booked to utilize the GWR course was not enabled access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early long periods of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A consequent court hearing found in the Met's support, as it was an impermanent course of action.
