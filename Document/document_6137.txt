On the morning of 8 April Tanzanian officers held a last gathering in the Entebbe State House before the assault on Kampala. Brigadier Mwita Marwa, leader of the 208th Brigade, directed the preparation. Nyerere mentioned that his administrators leave the eastern street from the city prompting Jinja be left clear so Libyan troops and remote ambassadors could empty. He felt that by giving the Libyans a chance to get away, Libya could dodge mortification and unobtrusively pull back from the war. Nyerere additionally expected that further clash with Libyan troops would prompt Afro-Arab pressures and welcome the equipped aggressiveness of other Arab states. He made an impression on Gaddafi clarifying his choice, saying that the Libyans could be carried out of Uganda unopposed from the airstrip in Jinja. He further mentioned that his powers abstain from harming key structures in Kampala, including Mulago Hospital, Makerere University, and the Parliament of Uganda. The Tanzanian arrangement of assault required a development by the 207th Brigade and an UNLF unit from the west along the street from Masaka with a concurrent attack from Entebbe in the south by the 208th Brigade. The last's nineteenth Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Ben Msuya was reserved for the seizure of the downtown area, while different units were to cover their flanks in the hedge. The 201st Brigade was to keep up a "blocking activity" north of Kampala to keep Ugandan powers from getting away. The whole task should take three days to finish.
