A 3â0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the 2010â11 season gave Stoke two new records: The largest away win in the Premier League and largest top division away win since 1982 and also the first time since the 1983â84 season Stoke have won three top-flight matches in a row. Manager Pulis hailed the new records as ""A Fantastic Achievement"". For the second season running Stoke made it to the quarter final of the FA Cup after overcoming Cardiff City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton & Hove Albion. They met West Ham United in the quarters and won 2â1 thus earning a place in the FA Cup Semi-final for only the fourth time in their history. It was also be their first trip to the New Wembley Stadium when they took on Bolton Wanderers for a place in the final. Stoke comfortably beat Bolton 5â0 clinching a first FA Cup Final appearance in their 148-year history. However, they lost the final 1â0 to Manchester City. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the 2011â12 UEFA Europa League. Despite a strong season, with an 8th-place finish in sight, defeat at home to Wigan Athletic in the final game meant that Stoke finished 13th in the 2010â11 season.
