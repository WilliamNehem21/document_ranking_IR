The Manhattan Engineer District (MED) was formally settled by the Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on 16 August 1942. The name was picked by Groves and MED's locale engineer, Colonel James C. Marshall. Like other architect areas, it was named after the city where its base camp was situated, at 270 Broadway. In contrast to the others, be that as it may, it had no geographic limits, just a mission: to build up a nuclear bomb. Besides, Marshall had the specialist of a division engineer head and detailed straightforwardly to Reybold. Despite the fact that Reybold was happy with the advancement being made, Dr. Vannevar Bush was less so. He felt that forceful authority was required, and recommended the arrangement of a renowned officer as generally venture chief. Somervell, presently Chief of Army Service Forces, prescribed Groves. Somervell met Groves outside the meeting room where Groves had been affirming before a United States Congress advisory group on military lodging and educated him that "The Secretary of War has chosen you for an essential task, and the President has endorsed the selectionÃÂ ... In the event that you carry out the responsibility right, it will win the war." Groves couldn't shroud his failure at not accepting a battle task: "Gracious, that thing," he answered.
