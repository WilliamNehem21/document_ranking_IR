Horrocks became interested in writing, and submitted articles about military matters to newspapers and magazines including the "Picture Post" and "The Sunday Times". This led to a short but successful career as the presenter of a series of television programmes, "British Castles" (1962), "Men in Battle" and "Epic Battle", produced by Huw Wheldon. In these, Horrocks lectured on great historical battles, "highlighting excitement and interest" to allow the programmes to appeal to the widest possible audience. He was interviewed extensively for the Thames Television series, "The World at War", and, to his embarrassment, appeared on the cover of the BBC's "Radio Times" magazine. After his television career ended, he served on the board of the housebuilding company Bovis, and continued writing, contributing a column to "The Sunday Times" and editing a series of British Army regimental histories. In 1968 Horrocks collaborated with J & L Randall as editor of the 'Merit' board game 'Combat'. His portrait and signature appear on the box and in his introduction to the game he states "In war no two battles are ever the same because the terrain is always different and it is this, more than anything else, which influences the composition of the different armies and the tactics employed by the rival Commanders". His autobiography, "A Full Life", was published in 1960, and he co-authored "Corps Commander", an account of his battles in north-west Europe, published in 1977.
