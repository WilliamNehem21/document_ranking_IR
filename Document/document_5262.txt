While taking a shot at different ventures, Takahashi kept on endeavoring to consider amusement thoughts, trying to develop past being only a craftsman for Namco. Takahashi refered to two ideas that prompted the motivation of "Katamari Damacy". The first was a model appeared by Sony Computer Entertainment called "Densen" (Japanese for "control line") that had the player as a young lady navigate gliding islands of different homes associated by electrical cables. The diversion, however never discharged, gave Takahashi that the customary world could be made fascinating with just little changes to discernment, and that an amusement could be fun without the need to cause viciousness. The second thought was from the round of "tamakorogashi" played in Japanese school's "undÃÂkai" or sports days. In "tamakorogashi", understudies endeavor to push a mammoth ball into an objective. Both those thoughts prompted him thinking about a diversion where turning a ball would fold conventional stuff into it, making the ball bigger and bigger after some time. The night he imagined this thought, he addressed a companion, one of the amusement architects in Namco, to check whether it made for a decent diversion thought, who concurred it had potential. The following day, he addressed his previous supervisor, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the idea, further adding an approach to reuse the King and Prince characters he had recently proposed, who likewise concurred it would make for an extraordinary diversion.
