In "Vasool Raja MBBS" (2004), the character Vasool Raja (Haasan), while going to a class asks in the case of being a specialist is equal to being God, and in doing as such says "Anbe Venkatachalam", to which one of his colleagues delicately asks him, "would it say it isn't Anbe Sivam?". Haasan answers: "Let it be. We should have a go at something else for a change." The road theater arrangement including Kamal's character, Nallasivam, and his companions performing to make individuals mindful of the monstrosities submitted by Nassar's character, Kanadasamy Padayatchi, was re-made at Tiruchirappalli in 2008 by Pralayan and his troupe from "Chennai Kalai Kuzhu" under the title "Nammal Mudiyum". Interestingly, Pralayan's play investigated sex imbalance and abusive behavior at home rather than joblessness. Kannada performer Vishnuvardhan noted in 2010 that kindred on-screen character Sudeep's film "Just Maath Maathalli" (2010) looks to some extent like "Anbe Sivam". Hari Narayan, composing for "The Hindu" in 2014, makes reference to in his article on the Indian pragmatist and writer Narendra Dabholkar that Umesh Shukla's "OMGÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Oh My God!" (2012) was "a conditioned down variant of "Anbe Sivam" where discernment impels people to discover God in themselves, with imperfections, which praises the goodness of getting to be as much as that of being". In 2015 Uthiran of "The Hindu" in Tamil, makes reference to in his audit of "Orange Mittai" (2015) that the film's plot "may help watchers to remember "Anbe Sivam"". In 2017, Ashok, who coordinated the parody movie "Peechankai", makes reference to he was motivated by "Anbe Sivam" to turn into a chief.
