At 10:20 and 11:10, his boats were spotted by Royal Australian Air Force Hudson surveillance flying machine based at Milne Bay in New Guinea. The primary Hudson misidentified them as "three cruisers, three destroyers, and two seaplane tenders". (Note: Some records express that the primary Hudson's team recognized the foe sends effectively, however the organization of foe powers was transformed from the air ship groups' report by insight officers in Milne Bay.) The Hudson's team attempted to report the locating to the Allied radio station at Fall River, New Guinea. Getting no affirmation, they came back to Milne Bay at 12:42 to guarantee that the report was gotten as quickly as time permits. The second Hudson additionally neglected to report its locating by radio, however finished its watch and arrived at Milne Bay at 15:00. It detailed locating "two substantial cruisers, two light cruisers, and one obscure sort". For obscure reasons, these reports were not handed-off to the Allied armada off Guadalcanal until 18:45 and 21:30, separately, on August 8. U.S. official history specialist Samuel Morison wrote in his 1949 record that the RAAF Hudson's team neglected to report the locating until after they had landed and even had tea. This case stood out as truly newsworthy and was rehashed by numerous ensuing students of history. Later research has defamed this form of occasions, and in 2014, the U.S. Naval force's Naval History and Heritage Command recognized in a letter to the Hudson's radio administrator, who had campaigned for a considerable length of time to demonstrate his crewmates' innocence, that Morison's reactions were "baseless."
