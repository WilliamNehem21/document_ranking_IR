A few surveys from September to November 2003 indicated Clark driving the Democratic field of competitors or as a nearby second to Howard Dean with the Gallup survey having him in the lead position in the presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. The John Edwards battle expedited Hugh SheltonÃ¢ÂÂthe general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR present right on time due on "trustworthiness and character issues"Ã¢ÂÂ as a counsel, a move that drew analysis from the Clark crusade. Since Dean reliably surveyed in the number one spot in the Iowa assemblies, Clark quit taking an interest in the gatherings completely to concentrate on later primaries. The 2004 Iowa assemblies denoted a defining moment in the crusade for the Democratic selection, in any case, as leaders Dean and Dick Gephardt gathered outcomes far lower than anticipated, and John Kerry and John Edwards' battles profited in Clark's nonappearance. Clark performed sensibly well in later primaries, including a tie for third spot with Edwards in the New Hampshire essential and a thin triumph in the Oklahoma essential over Edwards. Nonetheless, he saw his third-place completes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focal point of his crusade. He pulled back from the race on February 11, 2004, and reported his underwriting of John Kerry at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 13. Clark trusted his quitting the Iowa council was one of his crusade's greatest missteps, saying to one supporter the day preceding he pulled back from the race that "everything would have been unique on the off chance that we had [been in Iowa]."
