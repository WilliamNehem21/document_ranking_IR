The Russian protective layer plate industry had not yet aced the procedure for shaping thick steel plates so the covering for these boats was requested from organizations in Germany and the United States. Indeed, even they couldn't create enough of the most recent sorts of covering plate in the amounts required for every one of the three boats. "Petropavlovsk" had customary nickel steel, while "Sevastopol" utilized Harvey reinforcement and "Poltava" was fitted with the most recent Krupp protective layer. The thicknesses of the covering plates changed trying to level their adequacy. In "Petropavlovsk", the most extreme thickness of the waterline defensive layer belt over the apparatus spaces was , which decreased to 12 inches side by side the magazines and decreased to a thickness of 8 crawls at its base edge. In the other two boats, it was thick over the apparatus spaces, over the magazines and at its lower edge. The belt secured of the boats' length and was high, of which the upper was expected to be over the waterline. It ended in transverse bulkheads thick fore and toward the back, leaving the finishes of the boats unprotected. Over the waterline belt was an upper strake of protection that kept running between the turret bases, seven and a half feet high. The closures of the upper belt were shut off by five-inch calculated transverse bulkheads that associated the finishes of the upper belt to the turret bolster tubes.
