In 2011, Williams played the performing artist Marilyn Monroe in "My Week with Marilyn", a dramatization portraying the beset creation of the 1957 satire "The Prince and the Showgirl", in view of records by Colin Clark, who took a shot at the last film. At first incredulous to play Monroe, as she shared little for all intents and purpose with her looks or identity, Williams went through a half year investigating her by perusing accounts, journals and notes, and contemplating her stance, stride, and idiosyncrasies. She likewise put on weight for the part, dyed her hair light, and on long periods of recording, went through more than three hours applying make-up. Williams sang three tunes for the film's soundtrack and reproduced an exhibition of Monroe singing and moving to "Warmth Wave". Roger Ebert believed Williams' execution to be the film's prime resource and credited her for effectively bringing out numerous parts of Monroe's identity. Dwindle Travers opined that in spite of not physically taking after Monroe, she had "with savage aestheticness and feeling [illuminated] Monroe's bits of knowledge and weaknesses about herself at the tallness of her notoriety". Williams won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and got her second continuous Oscar designation for it.
