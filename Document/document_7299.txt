The products of regal support were shown by the development of an extensive church ( long), inherent the elegant French-affected Gothic style spearheaded by Henry's bricklayers at Westminster Abbey. The high caliber and expand nature of the congregation's enhancement, especially its moldings and tracery, demonstrate how the machine of regal support lead to a move far from the intentional somberness of the early Cistercian places of worship towards the greatness at that point considered fitting to a common church, for example, a house of prayer. Development of the congregation continued from east to west. The asylum and transepts were fabricated first to enable the priests to hold administrations, and the nave was finished after some time. It isn't known exactly when the structure work started, yet real blessings by King Henry of material timber and lead from Derbyshire in 1251 and 1252 demonstrate that a portion of the eastern pieces of the congregation, and presumably of the east shelter run as well, had by then achieved a propelled stage. The nearness of an establishment stone at the base of the southeast wharf of the intersection recorded "H. DI. GRA REX ANGE" (Latin for "Henry by the Grace of God King of the English") demonstrates that the establishments of the focal point of the congregation achieved ground level following 1251, the year Henry III formally turned into the monastery's benefactor. Taking numerous decades to finish, the congregation was presumably completed somewhere in the range of 1290 and 1320. Dating the different pieces of the structure depends dominatingly on expressive criteria.
