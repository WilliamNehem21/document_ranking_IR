The MCC group which visited Australia was incredibly solid in batting, and Leyland filled in as back-up to the principle batsmen. The English batting line-up was agreed to a large portion of the arrangement, leaving little open door for the back-ups; in spite of the fact that Mead played in the primary Test, he was consequently forgotten to reinforce the bowling. Playing in other top of the line coordinates on the visit, Leyland scored hundreds of years against South Australia and Queensland. With England 4Ã¢ÂÂ 0 ahead in the arrangement, Chapman remained down from the last Test; despite the fact that it isn't clear why he did as such, one plausibility is that he wished to give however many individuals from the group as could be expected under the circumstances an opportunity to show up in the Tests. Then again, he may have felt that his batting structure did not warrant a spot in the group. Whatever the reason, Leyland had his spot. Britain lost the match, however Leyland was effective. He scored 137, his first Test century, and 53 not out. The report in "Wisden" expressed: "[He] separated himself by two extremely wonderful displaysÃÂ ... His display of incredible, very much planned driving past spread point will long be recalled by the individuals who saw it." Overall, in top of the line coordinates on the visit, he scored 614 keeps running at 43.85, however his bowling was ineffectual on the hard pitches. Following his achievement in the last Test, Leyland was required to wind up one of the main English batsmen, and before the 1929 season he was named one of the "Wisden" Cricketers of the Year for his exhibitions in the 1928 season.
