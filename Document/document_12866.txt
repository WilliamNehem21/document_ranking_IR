"Maniples" were units of 120 men each drawn from a solitary infantry class. The maniples were little enough to allow strategic development of individual infantry units on the front line inside the system of the more prominent armed force. The maniples were commonly sent into three discrete lines (Latin: "triplex acies") in light of the three overwhelming infantry kinds of "hastati", "principes" and "triarii". The primary sort, the "hastati", regularly framed the principal rank in fight development. They regularly wore a metal chest plate (however some could manage the cost of mail), a protective cap called a galea, and every so often, greaves (shin protectors). They conveyed an iron bossed wooden shield, 120ÃÂ cm (4ÃÂ ft) tall and rectangular fit as a fiddle with a bended front to halfway ensure the sides. Customarily they were equipped with a sword known as a "gladius" and two tossing lances known as "pila": one the overwhelming "pilum" of prominent creative energy and one a thin spear. Anyway the accurate presentation of the Gladius and the supplanting of the lance with the sword as the essential weapon of the Roman Legions is questionable, and it's conceivable that the early manipular armies still battled with the Hastati and Principes employing the Hasta or Spear.
