"Interests" throwing chief Jacklynn Briskey initially dismissed 26-year-old Brook Kerr for the job of Whitney, trusting she would look too develop to even consider playing an adolescent. In spite of this choice, Kerr's better half Christopher Warren presented his significant other's head shots to the system and she was contracted to play the character. Kerr later depicted the seven day stretch of trying out and two screen tests to be formally given in the job a role as a very speedy procedure. While talking about her depiction of the character, Kerr stated, "I was dependably the reasonable one, the companion everybody could rely on, continually doing what I should." Over the course of the arrangement, news sources as often as possible theorized on the precise idea of Whitney's association with Chad. The interbreeding storyline drove news sources to sensationalize Harmony as where "half-kin lay down with each other." "Cleanser Opera Digest" recorded the 2006 disclosure that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood as one of "Interests" most stunning insider facts.
