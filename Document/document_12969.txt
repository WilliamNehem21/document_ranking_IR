On August 31, 1971, C.G. Carsey, a representative in the Astronaut Office in Houston, composed affirmations on 100 of the spreads, with the guide of other NASA workers in her office. The affirmations expressed the spread had been on the Moon on board the "Bird of prey". The spreads previously conveyed a manually written proclamation marked by Scott and Irwin that they had been arrived on the Moon on July 30. Carsey later expressed that in marking the confirmations as a Texas legal official open, she just expected to guarantee their marks were real. The topic of whether Carsey had inappropriately ensured that the spreads had been arrived on the Moon (something she had no close to home learning of) was the subject of an examination by the Texas Attorney General. With the legal official confirmations, the remainder of Sieger's prerequisites for the spreads was satisfied. On September 2, Scott sent the 100 covers by enrolled mail to Eiermann, who was in Stuttgart where he had moved. Eiermann turned the spreads over to Sieger, and was remunerated with a commission of about $15,000Ã¢ÂÂ10% of the foreseen continues. The staying 300 were endowed by the space explorers to a Houston-region stamp authority who organized with a nearby printer to have an engraving expressing that the spread had been conveyed to the Moon imprinted in the upper left. The printer found there were 298 spreads, not 300; the stamp gatherer counseled Scott, who informed him not to stress concerning it. One of Irwin's spreads from the gathering of eight, with a shamrock structure as its cachet, was given to Rhodes and one to the leader of the Kennedy Space Center Philatelic Society; Irwin said in 1972 that he had held the other six.
