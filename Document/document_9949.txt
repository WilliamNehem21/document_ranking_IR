Two unique records of Thomas' life are related in both Genesios and "Theophanes Continuatus". As indicated by the principal account, Thomas initially showed up in 803 going with general Bardanes Tourkos, and sought after a military vocation until propelling his revolt in late 820. In the second form, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered the administration of a man with the high court rank of "patrikios". At that point, found attempting to submit infidelity with his lord's significant other, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he stayed for a long time. Professing to be the killed sovereign Constantine VI (r. 780Ã¢ÂÂ 797), he at that point drove an Arab-supported attack of Asia Minor, however was vanquished and rebuffed. Established and Byzantine researcher J.B. Cover endeavored to accommodate the two accounts, setting Thomas' trip to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and after that having him come back to Byzantine administration before 803, while the Russian researcher Alexander Vasiliev translated the sources as inferring that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's affidavit in 797, and that his cooperation in Bardanes' revolt must be limited altogether. The second form of Thomas' story is expressly favored by Genesios and "Theophanes Continuatus", and is the just a single recorded in ninth century sources, to be specific the annal of George the Monk and the "Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos". By the by, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to think of it as a questionable later custom made by his opponent Michael II to dishonor Thomas, and rejected it out and out, wanting to depend on the main record alone. Most current researchers tail him in this translation.
