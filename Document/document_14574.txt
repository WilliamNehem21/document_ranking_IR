Roosevelt respected this idea of a joint venture as adequately essential to have the letter actually conveyed by Frederick L. Hovde, the leader of the NDRC mission in London, yet Churchill did not react until December. He guaranteed Roosevelt of his readiness to work together, and educated him that Hovde had examined the issue with Sir John Anderson and Lord Cherwell, as Frederick Lindemann was presently known. The MAUD Committee had thought about the issue of joint effort with the United States, and had reasoned that while pilot isotope partition plants could be set up in the United Kingdom, full-scale generation offices would need to be worked in the United States. The British communicated worries about the security of the American undertaking. Unexpectedly, it was the British undertaking that had just been entered by nuclear covert operatives. John Cairncross had given the Soviet Union a duplicate of the MAUD Committee report. Despite the fact that not passed on to the Americans, the British had different worries about what may occur after the war if the Americans grasped nonintervention, as had happened after the First World War, and Britain needed to battle the Soviet Union alone. The open door for a joint venture was thusly missed. English and American trade of data proceeded yet their projects stayed discrete.
