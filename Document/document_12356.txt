The fundamental German assault was to be made by the 50th Reserve Division of "General der Infanterie" Hugo von Kathen's XXIII Reserve Corps. The 50th Reserve Division was a Prussian division that had been engaged with the Spring Offensive from the start. It had a couple of days' rest before the development was deferred by the British at Albert and Dernancourt and its spirit was still high. The correct prong of the assault would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) progressing through the ninth Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the part held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would comprise of the 230th RIR, progressing from the territory of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and nineteenth NF. In this part, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, at that point III Battalion, 230 RIR (III/230 RIR) would strike the dike. After the catch of the dike, the ambushing troops would push northwest over the AlbertÃ¢ÂÂ Amiens street, at that point advance west towards Amiens. II Battalion, 230 RIR (II/230 RIR) was to catch up the attack of III/230 RIR. Both regimental authorities thought about that the arrangement could possibly succeed if the dike was feebly held and made portrayals to their unit leader, without much of any result. The German mounted guns planning was to last just 45 minutes.
