As confirm by the way in which Hewett left Somerset and strolled off amid the Scarborough Festival of 1895, he had a short breaker. Partner Frederic John Poynton described his skipper as a player who endured "from a profound, troublesome nature, which once resentful, took long to recuperate". He was a solid head who was both regarded and dreaded by his partners. In 1885, Somerset County Cricket Club had neglected to handle eleven players for a portion of their top of the line challenges, and in the majority of their different matches were a poor side. Hewett took on the region captaincy in 1889, and in his second year drove his side unbeaten against individual district resistance to win the 'Below average County Championship', and addition re-admission to the top of the line amusement. Hewett's batting and captaincy were supported by the rise of Woods and Palairet, both of whom were named as "Wisden" Cricketers of the Year somewhere in the range of 1889 and 1893. In 1891, Somerset completed joint fifth among the nine top notch districts, while the resulting year they rose to third. Hewett's last season at Somerset was the district's most ineffective under his captaincy, winning only four of their sixteen matches to complete in eighth.
