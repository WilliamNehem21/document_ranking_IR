The movement theme is a common subject in "Voyaging Shoes", as prove in the book's title, however Angelou's essential inspiration in living in Africa, as she told questioner George Plimpton in 1990, was "endeavoring to return home". Angelou not just related her own adventure of an African-American lady hunting down a home, however the voyages of other Black ostracizes at the time, whom McPherson contrasted with the portrayals of white exiles in Europe during the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were settled toward the finish of "Voyaging Shoes" when she chose to come back to America. She considered her takeoff a "second leave-taking", and contrasted it with the last time she left her child with his grandma in "Singin' and Swingin'" when he was a youngster, and to the constrained takeoff from Africa by her progenitors. As Lupton states, "Angelou's voyage from Africa back to America is in sure ways a rehashing of the authentic stage known as mid-entry, when slaves were ruthlessly transported in boats from West Africa to the alleged New World". Despite the fact that Angelou's 6th collection of memoirs "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" occurred in her nation of origin, the movement theme proceeded. Commentator Patricia Elam portrayed "Melody" as a "venture through a credible and masterful life".
