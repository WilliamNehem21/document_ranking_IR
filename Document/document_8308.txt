In 1990 Gielgud showed up in the James Scott-coordinated "Strike It Rich", an adjustment of a Graham Greene epic co-featuring Molly Ringwald and Robert Lindsay. That equivalent year he showed up in a main job, playing Prospero in "Prospero's Books", Peter Greenaway's adjustment of "The Tempest". Audits for the film were blended, yet Gielgud's execution in one of his mark jobs was highly commended. He kept on chipping away at radio, as he had done all through his profession; Croall records more than fifty BBC radio preparations of plays featuring Gielgud somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1994. To stamp his ninetieth birthday celebration he played Lear once and for all; for the BBC Kenneth Branagh accumulated a cast that included Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Emma Thompson as Lear's girls, with on-screen characters, for example, Bob Hoskins, Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale in supporting jobs. He kept on showing up on TV until 1994; his last job in the medium was in a BBC generation that time of J. B. Priestley's once in a while restored "Summer Day's Dream". Along these lines, he showed up in movies including Branagh's "Hamlet" (as King Priam, 1996), "Dragonheart" (as the voice of King Arthur, 1996), and "Sparkle" (as Cecil Parkes, 1996). His last element film appearance was as Pope Pius V in Shekhar Kapur's "Elizabeth" (1999). In 2000 he had a non-talking job close by Pinter in a movie of Beckett's short play "Disaster" coordinated by David Mamet.
