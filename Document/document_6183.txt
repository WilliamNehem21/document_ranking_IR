Theropods from these developments incorporate genera of tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, troodontids, avialans, caenagnathids, and dromaeosaurids. "Acheroraptor" and "Dakotaraptor" are dromaeosaurids from the Hell Creek Formation. Uncertain dromaeosaurs are known from other fossil arrangements. Normal teeth recently alluded to "Dromaeosaurus" and "Saurornitholestes" later were viewed as "Acheroraptor". The tyrannosaurids from the arrangement are "Nanotyrannus" and "Tyrannosaurus", in spite of the fact that the previous may be a lesser equivalent word of the last mentioned. Among ornithomimids are the genera "Struthiomimus" just as "Ornithomimus", in spite of the fact that an undescribed creature named "Orcomimus" could be from the arrangement. Troodontids are just spoken to by "Pectinodon" and "Paronychodon" in the Hell Creek Formation; with a conceivable types of "Troodon" from the Lance Formation. One types of coelurosaur is known from Hell Creek and comparable arrangements by a solitary animal types, "Richardoestesia". Just three oviraptorosaurs are from the Hell Creek Formation, "Anzu", "Leptorhynchos" and a mammoth types of caenagnathid, fundamentally the same as "Gigantoraptor", from South Dakota. Nonetheless, just fossilized impressions were found. The avialans known from the development are "Avisaurus", numerous types of "Brodavis", and a few different types of hesperornithoforms, just as a few types of genuine flying creatures including "Cimolopteryx".
