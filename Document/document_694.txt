Abstract commentator Richard Erlich wrote in 2006 that the delineation of the religious clique of Bliss was impacted by Le Guin's enthusiasm for Taoist idea, and a case of Le Guin's scrutinize of Christianity. The heavenly attendants utilization of the expression "the planetary speculation" to allude to their earthly cause was a delicate dive at Christian fundamentalism in the United States, with its request that development is "just a hypothesis." The story likewise alludes to the achievement of Christian fundamentalists in assuming control over educational committees in the US. A more straightforward analysis of Christianity comes in Le Guin's portrayal of the clique of Bliss being rude of ladies, just as of having faith in an atomic, male centric family. Happiness is depicted as a shut framework; individuals strengthen control the ship's information banks to expel references to Earth and their goal, since they esteem solidness even to the point of precluding some from claiming their own insight. A reference to Christianity is likewise present in Le Guin's assertion to depict movement outside the ship: this present reality term "extravehicular action" or EVA is utilized as a solitary word "Eva," in reference to the scriptural "Eve": heavenly attendants in the story see going outside the ship as a demonstration of transgression related with death.
