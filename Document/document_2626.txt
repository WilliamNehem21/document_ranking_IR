After accepting the Appleton contract, Davis had sent letters to his previous partners, looking for supporting documentation. At the point when Walthall sent two proposed parts to New York in 1878, Appleton returned them, forewarning that it didn't need a long repeat of established history, yet rather a record of Davis' activities as the Confederacy's leader. The distributer at that point sent William J. Tenney, a states-rights Democrat and staff part, to visit Beauvoir to get the risky composition into publishable shape. When despite everything it neglected to arrive, Derby actually went to Mississippi in February 1880. At this point, Derby had progressed $8,000, yet Davis admitted that he had seen few pages, attesting that Walthall had the rest. Since Davis did not have any desire to abandon the book nor return the assets (and had officially sold the properties he got from Dorsey), he concurred that Tenney would relocate to a bungalow at Beauvoir. On May 1, 1880, Davis disjoined all associations with Walthall, who had gained little ground in the former two years. Davis and Tenney at that point finished "The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government" (1881), in two volumes of 700 and 800 pages individually.
