Be that as it may, Milk's death has progressed toward becoming weaved with his political viability, incompletely on the grounds that he was slaughtered at the apex of his fame. Student of history Neil Miller expresses, "No contemporary American gay pioneer still can't seem to accomplish in life the stature Milk found in death." His inheritance has turned out to be questionable; Randy Shilts finishes up his life story composing that Milk's prosperity, murder, and the unavoidable treachery of White's decision spoke to the experience of all gays. Milk's life was "a representation for the gay involvement in America". As indicated by Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend has been unfit to be supported as nobody seemed ready to have his spot in the years after his demise: "The Castro considered him to be a saint however comprehended his affliction as an end as opposed to a start. He had kicked the bucket, and with him a lot of the Castro's hopefulness, optimism, and aspiration appeared to bite the dust also. The Castro could locate nobody to have his spot in its affections, and potentially needed nobody." On the twentieth commemoration of Milk's passing, student of history John D'Emilio stated, "The heritage that I figure he would need to be associated with is the basic to carry on with one's life consistently with trustworthiness." For a political profession so short, Cleve Jones ascribes more to his death than his life: "His homicide and the reaction to it made perpetual and irrefutable the full interest of gay and lesbian individuals in the political procedure."
