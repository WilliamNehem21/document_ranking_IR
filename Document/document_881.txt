"Oryzomys peninsulae" was first gathered in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas depicted it in 1897 as a full types of "Oryzomys". It was held as a particular animal types identified with "O.ÃÂ couesi" and "O.ÃÂ palustris" until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz cleared it, and other remote populaces of similar species gathering, as subspecies under an extended idea of "O.ÃÂ palustris". Raymond Hall agreed in the second release (1981) of "Warm blooded animals of North America", contending that "O.ÃÂ peninsulae" varied less from terrain "Oryzomys" populaces (as of now delegated "O.ÃÂ couesi mexicanus") than some different structures he incorporated into "O.ÃÂ palustris" contrasted from one another. After investigations of the contact zone between North American "O.ÃÂ palustris" and Central American "O.ÃÂ couesi" in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) clarified that the two are particular from one another, "O.ÃÂ peninsulae" stayed as a subspecies of "O.ÃÂ couesi". In 2009, Michael Carleton and JoaquÃÂ­n Arroyo-Cabrales assessed the characterization of western Mexican "Oryzomys" and utilized morphological and morphometrical information to portray four unmistakable "Oryzomys" species in the locale. "O.ÃÂ peninsulae" and another disengaged populace, "O.ÃÂ nelsoni" from the Islas MarÃÂ­as, were both held as independent species, as seemed to be "O.ÃÂ albiventer" from montane terrain Mexico. They kept the populace in the beach front swamps as a subspecies, "O.ÃÂ couesi mexicanus", of "Oryzomys couesi".
