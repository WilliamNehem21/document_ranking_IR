First season regular cast member Malcolm David Kelley returned in an uncredited cameo for a single scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did not appear in the cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of "Time Out" stated that "You gotta hand it to the "Lost" writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet â¦ it's been years, and â¦ Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? â¦ They just didn't show him. Clever." TMZ's Daniel thought that "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [is] a foot taller than he should be â¦ I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". "Wizard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nikki Stafford went so far as to remark that "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley â¦ I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role."
