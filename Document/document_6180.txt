In 1983, DC Comics procured a line of characters from Charlton Comics. Amid that period, essayist Alan Moore pondered composing a story that included an unused line of superheroes that he could patch up, as he had done in his "Miracleman" arrangement in the mid 1980s. Moore contemplated that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders may be accessible for such an undertaking, so he contrived a homicide riddle plot which would start with the revelation of the body of the Shield in a harbor. The essayist felt it didn't make a difference which set of characters he eventually utilized, as long as perusers remembered them "so it would have the stun and amazement esteem when you saw what the truth of these characters was". Moore utilized this reason and created a proposition including the Charlton characters titled "Who Killed the Peacemaker", and presented the spontaneous proposition to DC overseeing manager Dick Giordano. Giordano was open to the proposition, yet restricted utilizing the Charlton characters for the story. Moore stated, "DC understood their costly characters would finish up either dead or useless." Instead, Giordano induced Moore to proceed with new characters. Moore had at first trusted that unique characters would not give enthusiastic reverberation to the perusers, yet later altered his opinion. He stated, "In the long run, I understood that on the off chance that I composed the substitute characters all around ok, with the goal that they appeared to be well-known in certain ways, certain parts of them brought back a sort of conventional superhuman reverberation or nature to the peruser, at that point it may work."
