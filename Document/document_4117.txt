At about this time, adding to weight from the ubiquity of the "Vachana" ordinance in the northern Kannada-talking area, the prominent Hoysala ruler Vishnuvardhana (1108Ã¢ÂÂ 1152) of the southern Kannada-talking district changed over from Jainism to the Hindu organization of Vaishnavism. The prevalence of Ramanujacharya's logic had spread in the Hoysala terrains and Srivaishnavism, a sub-organization of Vaishnavism, was in the ascendant. By the late thirteenth century, the Veerashaiva essayists, who were at this point composing metaphorical engravings and memoirs of renowned "Vachanakaras" of the twelfth century, were in hardened challenge with the Jains. The most punctual endeavors by the Jains to veer far from customary "puranic" (philosophical) subjects of renunciation are found in the works of Hoysala scholars Nemichandra and Andayya. "Lilavati Prabhandam", a novel composed by Nemichandra (1170) on the point of adoration, erotica, and of the triumph of Kamadeva (divine force of affection) over his main adversary Shiva, is the first among such works. It was trailed by "Kabbigara Kava" ("Poets protector", 1215Ã¢ÂÂ 1237) by Andayya, additionally a work delineating a war among Kamadeva and the god Shiva. Regardless of these endeavors, the Jain scholarly impact was to retreat in the coming decades and hundreds of years, being consigned for the most part to the beach front Kannada-talking locale. Works of suffering quality were still created by free thinker creators, for example, Ratnakaravarni (1557), however their numbers were less.
