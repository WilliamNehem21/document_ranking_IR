Hindfoot length is 37ÃÂ mm (1.5ÃÂ in). The upper sides of the feet are secured with grayish white hide, which stretches out around the hooks to frame ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is generally short at 6ÃÂ mm (0.2ÃÂ in); the hallux (first digit) is 8ÃÂ mm (0.3ÃÂ in) long, and different digits 11 to 12ÃÂ mm (0.4 to 0.5ÃÂ in). The tail is 238ÃÂ mm (9.4ÃÂ in) long and bare to a limited extent. At the base, it is dull dark colored both above and underneath, however somewhat lighter beneath. The upper side stays dim dark colored for quite a bit of its length, however the shading becomes lighter towards the tip. The lower side ends up mottled at about 55ÃÂ mm (2.2ÃÂ in) from the tip and after that whitish at about 65ÃÂ mm (2.6ÃÂ in). It has an all around created tuft at its tail tip, comprising of whitish and periodic light darker hairs. This tuft starts at about 130ÃÂ mm (5.1ÃÂ in) from the base with genuinely short hairs and turns out to be increasingly articulated at 180ÃÂ mm (7.1ÃÂ in). Interestingly, the more prominent huge footed mouse has a more fragile, dim dark colored tuft.
