Butler became aware of the slave trade of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879. Young girls were considered "fair game", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13. After playing a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking, Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880, and wrote to "The Shield" that "the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls", and that in one house "there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of ageÂ ... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed, got from English country villages by every artifice and sold to these human shambles". She visited Brussels where she met the mayor and local councillors and made allegations against the head of the Belgian ' and his deputy as to their involvement in the trade. After the meeting she was contacted by a detective who confirmed that the senior members of the ' were guilty of collusion with brothel keepers. She returned home and filed a deposition containing a copy of the statement from the detective and sent them to the ' (Chief Prosecutor) and the British Home Secretary. Following an investigation in Belgium, the head of the ' was removed from office, and his deputy was put on trial alongside 12 brothel owners; all were imprisoned for their roles in the trade.
