A few reasons for the decay and abrupt vanishing of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all associated with the exercises of people on RÃÂ©union, who it made due close by for two centuries. An oft-rehashed proposal is that the presentation of the regular myna ("Acridotheres tristis") prompted rivalry between these two starling species. The myna was acquainted with RÃÂ©union in 1759 to battle beetles, and turned into an irritation itself. Be that as it may, the hoopoe starling coincided with the myna for about 100ÃÂ years and they might not have shared environment. The dark rodent ("rattus") landed on Reunion during the 1670s, and the darker rodent ("Rattus norvegicus") in 1735, increasing quickly and undermining horticulture and local species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rodents possessed tree holes and would have gone after eggs, adolescents, and settling feathered creatures. Amid the mid-nineteenth century the RÃÂ©union cut eared skink ("Gongylomorphus borbonicus") ended up wiped out because of predation by the presented wolf wind ("Lycodon aulicum"), which may have denied the flying creature of a critical nourishment source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted sicknesses from presented winged animals, a factor known to have activated decreases and annihilations in endemic Hawaiian fowls. As per British scientist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the central reason for the hoopoe starling's elimination; the species had made due for ages regardless of different dangers.
