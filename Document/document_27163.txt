In May 1908, Archibald Leitch wrote to the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) â who had a rail depot adjacent to the proposed site for the football ground â in an attempt to persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of Â£10,000, to be paid back at the rate of Â£2,000 "per annum" for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated Â£2,750 "per annum" in fares offsetting the Â£9,800 cost of building the station. The station â Trafford Park â was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.
