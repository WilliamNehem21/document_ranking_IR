Along with the buff-banded rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail has been placed in either the genus "Gallirallus" or the genus "Hypotaenidia"; the latter is considered a synonym of the former by some authorities. The specific name "pacificus" refers to the Pacific Ocean and is Latin for "peaceful". The genus name "Gallirallus" is a combination of the genus names "Gallus" and "Rallus". In 1977 the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that the Tahiti rail was an isolated form of buff-banded rail, and perhaps belonged to a superspecies with that bird and the Wake Island rail ("Gallirallus wakensis"). Rails are some of the most widespread terrestrial vertebrates, and have colonised practically all island groups, with many island species being flightless. In 1973 the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson argued that many insular flightless species of rails were descended from still extant flighted rails, that flightlessness had evolved independently and rapidly in many different island species, and that this feature is therefore of no taxonomic importance. Flightlessness can be advantageous (especially where food is scarce) because it conserves energy by decreasing the mass of flight muscles; the absence of predators (particularly mammalian) and a reduced need for dispersal are factors that allow this feature to develop in island birds.
