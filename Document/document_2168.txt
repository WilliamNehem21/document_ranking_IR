At its pinnacle, Diane built up an all around characterized eye about in breadth, portrayed by observation flying machine as taking the state of an "altered teacup". The most grounded breezes were situated in the upper east quadrant, where there was an optional weight least found upper east of the eye. In the wake of moving toward the north for about multi day, Diane continued its westbound movement on AugustÃÂ 13, after Hurricane Connie toward the northwest had debilitated. That day, Diane achieved its most minimal weight of , and pinnacle winds of 105ÃÂ mph (170ÃÂ km/h); initially the tropical storm was broke down to achieve top breezes of 120ÃÂ mph (195ÃÂ km/h), despite the fact that the vast size and moderate forward speed proposed the lower winds. It kept up its pinnacle twists for about 12ÃÂ hours, after which it debilitated because of cooler air in the locale. By AugustÃÂ 15, the eye had turned out to be ineffectively characterized, and twists consistently debilitated. As it moved toward land, its inside disintegrated, with negligible precipitation close to the middle; the eye was seen on a radar introduced in July 1955. On AugustÃÂ 17, Diane made landfall on the bank of North Carolina close Wilmington. Weight at landfall was assessed at , joined by twists simply under sea tempest force. Diane struck the state just five days after Hurricane Connie struck a similar general region.
