Gilmore's characterization was bolstered by the American scientistss Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer in their 1943 survey of the vault headed dinosaurs, by then known from 46 skulls. From these examples, Brown and Schlaikjer named the new species "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" (both from Alberta), just as moving the extensive species "T. wyomingensis" (which was named in 1931) to the new family "Pachycephalosaurus", alongside two different species. They discovered "T. validus" particular from "T. formosus", however considered "S. brevis" the female type of "T. validus", and accordingly a lesser equivalent word. At this point, the vault headed dinosaurs were either viewed as relatives of ornithopods or of ankylosaurs. In 1945, in the wake of analyzing throws of "T. formosus" and "S. validus" teeth, the American scientist Charles M. Sternberg exhibited contrasts between the two, and rather proposed that "Troodon" was a theropod dinosaur, and that the arch headed dinosaurs ought to be set in their own family. However "Stegoceras" was the main individual from this family to be named, Sternberg named the gathering Pachycephalosauridae after the second sort, as he found that name (signifying "thick head reptile") progressively spellbinding. He likewise considered "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" individuals from "Stegoceras", discovered "S. brevis" substantial, and named another species, "S. lambei", in view of an example in the past alluded to "S. validus". The split from "Troodon" was bolstered by Russell in 1948, who portrayed a theropod dentary with teeth practically indistinguishable to those of "T. formosus".
