In mid 1901 the boats experienced intermittent upkeep. The fixes were finished by mid-March, at which time the individuals from the squadron rejoined in Kiel. They at that point started a preparation voyage into the Baltic Sea, ceasing in Danzig on 1 April. There, Koester educated Prince Heinrich about up and coming joint Army-Navy moves. While coming back to Kiel the evening of 1Ã¢ÂÂ 2 April, "Kaiser Friedrich III" struck an unfamiliar shake off Kap Arkona only north of the Adlergrund at around 01:27. The stone tore a vast gap in the starboard side of the frame and harmed four of the ship's watertight compartments, which loaded up with water and made the ship rundown to port. In the end, some of water entered the ship. The stun from the crash harmed the ship's boilers and began a flame in the coal shelters, which spread to the starboard toward the back engine compartment, constraining the team to close down the ship's motors. The majority of the ship's ammo magazines, motor rooms, and capacity compartments must be overflowed to keep the flame from spreading. Three men were genuinely harmed while battling the flame, one of which kicked the bucket of his wounds.
