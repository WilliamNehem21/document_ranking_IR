For an amazing duration, Wrigley was a "deep rooted note-taker" who arranged broad documentation concerning the hypothesis and routine with regards to air control, on which he addressed among partners in the RAAF amid the 1920s. The ideas that he proliferated included air prevalence, the requirement for an aviation based armed forces to be discrete from different parts of the equipped administrations, control of the air as a methods for doing hostile strikes, and the substitution of airborne powers for ground troops. While contending for the autonomy of the air arm, Wrigley rushed to disperse any idea that it would just "land from God knows where, drop [its] bombs God knows where, and go off again God knows where"; rather it should act working together with the military and naval force in encouragement of government arrangement. He is consequently credited with establishing the frameworks for the RAAF's cutting edge air control tenet, which would in the long run be classified as the "Air Power Manual" in 1990. Wrigley's widow handed down twenty volumes of his works, maps, and photos to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook after his passing; they were altered and distributed via Air Commodore Brendan O'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as "The Decisive Factor: Air Power Doctrine via Air Vice-Marshal H.N. Wrigley". In 1996, Wrigley's previous home as leader of RAAF Station Laverton before World WarÃÂ II was dedicated Wrigley House in his respect. His name is additionally borne by Henry Wrigley Drive, moving toward Darwin International Airport. In March 2010, the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, built up the AVM H.N. Wrigley Prize for air control examination, as a feature of the yearly Chief of Air Force Essay Competition.
