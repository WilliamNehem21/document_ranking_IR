As Patey anticipated, von Spee had proceeded with east, and it was not until his power incurred the primary thrashing on the Royal Navy in 100 years at the Battle of Coronel that "Australia" was permitted to seek after. Withdrawing on 8 November, the battlecruiser renewed coal from a pre-situated collier on 14 November, and came to Chamela Bay (close Manzanillo, Mexico) after 12 days. Patey was made officer of a global squadron entrusted with keeping the German squadron from cruising north to Canadian waters, or tailing them on the off chance that they endeavored to enter the Atlantic through the Panama Canal or around Cape Horn. Patey's boats included "Australia", the British light cruiser and the Japanese cruisers , and the ex-Russian war vessel "Hizen". The boats made for the Galapagos Islands, which were sought from 4 to 6 December. Subsequent to finding no hint of von Spee's power, the Admiralty requested Patey to research the South American coast from Perlas Island down to the Gulf of Guayaquil. The German squadron had cruised for the Atlantic by means of Cape Horn, and was vanquished by a British armada in the wake of endeavoring to attack the Falkland Islands on 8 December. Patey's squadron scholarly of this 10 December, while off the Gulf of Panama; "Australia"s faculty were disillusioned that they didn't get the opportunity to take on "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau". By and by, the battlecruiser's quality in the Pacific amid 1914 had given a critical counter to the German protected cruisers, and empowered the RAN to take an interest in the Admiralty's worldwide technique. Also, it is impossible that the assault on Rabaul would have proceeded had "Australia" not been accessible to secure the arrival drive.
