John's absence of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary writers and later students of history, with some presuming that John was, best case scenario offensive, or even agnostic, an intense issue at the time. Contemporary recorders indexed his different enemy of religious propensities finally, including his inability to take communion, his profane comments, and his clever yet outrageous jokes about chapel regulation, including jokes about the impossibility of the Resurrection. They remarked on the scarcity of John's magnanimous gifts to the congregation. Student of history Frank McLynn contends that John's initial a very long time at Fontevrault, joined with his generally propelled instruction, may have turned him against the congregation. Different antiquarians have been increasingly wary in deciphering this material, taking note of that recorders additionally revealed John's own enthusiasm for the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his companionships with a few senior pastors, most particularly with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later pronounced a holy person. Money related records demonstrate an ordinary illustrious family unit occupied with the typical dining experiences and devout observances Ã¢ÂÂ yet with numerous records demonstrating John's contributions to the poor to make amends for routinely defying church norms and direction. The history specialist Lewis Warren has contended that the writer accounts were liable to significant inclination and the King was "in any event ordinarily faithful", refering to his journeys and enthusiasm for religious sacred text and discourses.
