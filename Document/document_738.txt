The significant works for voices and symphony of the twenty-one years of Elgar's center period are three expansive scale works for soloists, theme and ensemble: "The Dream of Gerontius" (1900), and the oratorios "The Apostles" (1903) and "The Kingdom" (1906); and two shorter tributes, the "Crowning liturgy Ode" (1902) and "The Music Makers" (1912). The first of the tributes, as a "piÃÂ¨ce d'occasion", has infrequently been resuscitated after its underlying achievement, with the coming full circle "Place where there is Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unordinary in that it contains a few citations from his prior works, as Richard Strauss cited himself in "Ein Heldenleben". The choral works were all effective, in spite of the fact that the first, "Gerontius", was and remains the best-cherished and generally performed. On the original copy Elgar composed, citing John Ruskin, "This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and dozed, cherished and despised, similar to another. My life was as the vapor, and isn't; yet this I saw, and knew; this, in the event that anything of mine, merits your memory." All three of the vast scale works pursue the conventional model with segments for soloists, melody and both together. Elgar's unmistakable coordination, just as his melodic motivation, lifts them to a more elevated amount than the vast majority of their British forerunners.
