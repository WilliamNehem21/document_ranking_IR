After the race, Dow started to work with Republicans again in Maine to propel denial issues, and in 1884 he supported individual Mainer and Republican possibility for president James G. Blaine. Blaine barely lost the decision, the primary Republican misfortune in 28 years, and numerous Republicans accused the Prohibition Party, whose votes would have tipped New York (and with it the discretionary school lion's share) to Blaine. Angry Republicans in Maine wouldn't propel any more preclusion laws, and accordingly Dow made his last break with the Republican Party in 1885. In the 1886 state race, he talked intensely against his previous gathering and in help of the Prohibitionist possibility for senator. In 1888, at 84 years old, Dow acknowledged the Prohibition Party designation for city hall leader of Portland, an office he had held over thirty years sooner. The Democrats were unfit to settle on a competitor, so they embraced their previous adversary, Dow, with an end goal to unseat the Republican officeholder. Numerous ordinary Democrats would not bolster the combination ticket, and Dow lost the decision by 1934 votes to 3504. Soon thereafter, Dow went to the 1888 Prohibition Party National Convention in Indianapolis. In a break from his past scorn for the previous Confederacy, Dow called for sectional solidarity and "no all the more waving of the wicked shirt".
