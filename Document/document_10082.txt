Wilkinson languished over the vast majority of her life from bronchial asthma, which she disturbed throughout the years by substantial smoking and exhaust. She had frequently been sick amid the war, and had crumpled amid a visit to Prague in 1946. On 25 January 1947 she went to the opening of the Bristol Old Vic Theater School. The winter of 1946Ã¢ÂÂ 47 was particularly cold, and the function was held out of entryways. In the blink of an eye a while later, Wilkinson created pneumonia; on 3 February she was found in her London level in a state of extreme lethargy, and on 6 February 1947 she passed on in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. At the investigation the coroner gave the reason for death as "heart disappointment following emphysema, with intense bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia, quickened by barbiturate harming". Wilkinson had been taking a blend of medications for a while, to battle both her asthma and a sleeping disorder; the coroner trusted she had accidentally taken an overdose of barbiturates. With no proof to show that the overdose was purposeful, he recorded a decision of unplanned passing. Notwithstanding this, theory that Wilkinson had ended it all has persevered, the reasons refered to being the disappointment of her own association with Herbert Morrison and her feasible destiny in a reputed bureau reshuffle. In their 1973 life story of Morrison, Bernard Donoughue and G. W. Jones propose that, given Wilkinson's weakness, the weights of her ecclesiastical office turned out to be a lot for her. Be that as it may, the absence of decisive proof partitions history specialists about Wilkinson's goal to end her own life.
