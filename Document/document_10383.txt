As leader of the AIF, Blamey was liable straightforwardly to the Minister of Defense, instead of to the Military Board, with a contract dependent on that given to Bridges in 1914. Some portion of this necessitated his powers stay together as durable units, and that no Australian powers were to be conveyed or drawn in without the earlier assent of the Australian government. Blamey was not firm, and allowed Australian units to be withdrawn when there was a certified military need. Since the circumstance in the Middle East staggered from emergency to emergency, this brought about his troops winding up generally dispersed now and again. At the point when the emergencies had passed, in any case, he needed units came back to their parent arrangements. This brought about clashes with British officers. The first happened in August 1940 when the British Commander in Chief Middle East Command, General Sir Archibald Wavell, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, requested the sixteenth Infantry Brigade to move to Egypt. Blamey rejected in light of the fact that the unit was not yet completely prepared, yet in the end bargained, sending it on the understanding that it would before long be joined by the remainder of the sixth Division.
