As per the LomÃÂ© Agreement, UNAMSIL set up demilitarization camps all through Sierra Leone that were proposed to incapacitate the Sierra Leone Army, the RUF, and the state army bunches working in the nation. The SLA and some state army bunches started to enter the camps however the RUF did not. In April 2000, 10 individuals from the RUF entered an UNAMSIL camp without the information of the RUF's administration. After finding its warriors, the RUF requested their arrival. The military eyewitnesses can't, and the RUF reacted by assaulting the camp and assaulting other UNAMSIL bases in the region. They took substantial quantities of UN staff prisoner, and afterward started to progress into territories recently constrained by the Sierra Leone government. On 3 May, the RUF assumed responsibility for the town of Kambia. Remote ambassadors in the nation evaluated that the RUF could be in Freetown inside seven days, since the SLA had been kept to sleeping enclosure and had given over the greater part of its weapons as per the LomÃÂ© Agreement. The United Nations issued an announcement denouncing the viciousness, after which Secretary-General Kofi Annan advised the British delegate to the UN that it anticipated the United Kingdom, as the previous provincial power, to intercede in Sierra Leone straightforwardly, instead of depending on the universal network.
