Wishing to shoot the film in France, Besson couldn't discover appropriate offices and "with crushing sadness" recorded in London. It was essentially taped at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 Stage. Development of sets started in October 1995. The musical drama scene was taped at the Royal Opera House. Scenes delineated as being in Egypt were recorded in Mauritania; the primary shoot, a foundation shot of the desert, happened there on 5 January 1996. Shooting with performing artists started in late January, and was finished 21 weeks after the fact. Willis completed the process of shooting on 16 May, while Oldman just started recording the next week; the hero (Korben) and adversary (Zorg) never really share any screen time. In spite of being recorded in London, "The Fifth Element" was a French generation, and proceeded to turn into the costliest European film at any point set aside a few minutes. The structures in New York were gotten from both metabolist-motivated masses of measured lofts from the 1960s, and the cutting edge plans of planner Antonio Sant'Elia during the 1910s. Besson requested that the majority of the move shots make place without trying to hide, as he was purportedly tired of the dim spaceship passageways and faintly lit planets normal in sci-fi films, and needed a more splendid "happily insane" look instead of a desolate practical one. Gaultier planned all of the 900 outfits worn by additional items in the Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each ensemble each morning. His plans, depicted as "mentally transgressive", were said to challenge sexuality and sex standards. A solitary coat he intended for the film cost $5,000.
