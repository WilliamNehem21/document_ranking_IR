Anne was hitched to Prince George of Denmark, and in their six years of marriage Anne had been pregnant multiple times, yet none of her kids had endure. Her seventh pregnancy brought about the introduction of a child at 5 a.m. on 24 July 1689 in Hampton Court Palace. As it was normal for the births of potential beneficiaries to the position of authority to be gone to by a few observers, the King and Queen and "the greater part of the people of value about the court" were available. After three days, the infant was immersed William Henry after his uncle King William by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The King, who was one of the godparents alongside the Marchioness of Halifax and the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Dorset, announced him Duke of Gloucester, despite the fact that the peerage was never formally made. Gloucester was second in line to the royal position after his mom, and on the grounds that his introduction to the world verified the Protestant progression, he was the desire for the transformation's supporters. The tribute "The Noise of Foreign Wars", credited to Henry Purcell, was written in festivity of the birth. Other complimentary tributes, for example, Purcell's last imperial tribute "Who Can From Joy Refrain?" and John Blow's "The Duke of Gloucester's March" and "A Song upon the Duke of Gloucester", were created for his birthday events in later years. Adversaries of the unrest, supporters of James known as the Jacobites, talked about Gloucester as "a debilitated and bound usurper".
