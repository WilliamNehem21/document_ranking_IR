894 Squadron, outfitted with Seafires, arrived on board after the assault on 24 July to finish No. 24 Naval Fighter Wing. "Inexhaustible" and a few escort transporters assaulted focuses in Norway on 10 August, devastating 6 Messerschmitt Bf 110 warriors and sinking a minesweeper. For Operation Goodwood, a progression of assaults on "Tirpitz", the Grumman F6F Hellcat contenders of 1840 Squadron supplanted the Barracudas of 826 Squadron. The main mission occurred on the morning of 22 August when "Inexhaustible" propelled 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies, 8 Hellcats, and 8 Seafires against the German warship and close-by targets. A smoke screen again secured "Tirpitz" and no harm was dispensed; two Seafires neglected to return. Another assault was made later in the day without impact. A further assault couldn't be mounted until 24 August in light of terrible climate; for this mission the transporter contributed 12 Barracudas, 11 Fireflies and 4 Seafires, all of which returned. "Tirpitz" was delicately harmed by two hits amid this assault, one a bomb and the other a protection puncturing bomb. The last infiltrated the heavily clad deck yet neglected to detonate and would presumably have dispensed genuine harm, conceivably notwithstanding sinking the ship, had it done as such. A last assault was made five days after the fact, again without impact. 887 Squadron sank seven seaplanes at their moorings at Banak amid the task.
