The ashy-faced owl ("T. glaucops") was for some time included in "T. alba", and by some authors its populations from the Lesser Antilles still are. Based on DNA evidence, KÃ¶nig, Weick & Becking (2009) recognised the American Barn Owl ("T. furcata") and the CuraÃ§ao Barn Owl ("T. bargei") as separate species. They also proposed that "T. a. delicatula" should be split off as a separate species, to be known as the eastern barn owl, which would include the subspecies "T. d. sumbaensis", "T. d. meeki", "T. d. crassirostris" and "T. d. interposita". However, the International Ornithological Committee has doubts about this and states that the split of "Tyto delicatula" from "T. alba" "may need to be revisited". Some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species, a move which should await further research into barn owl phylogeography. According to Bruce in the "Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds", "a review of the whole group [is] long overdue". Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows a separation of the species into two clades, an Old World "alba" and a New World "furcata", but this study did not include "T. a. delicatula" which the authors seem to have accepted as a separate species. A high amount of genetic variation was also found between the Indonesian "T. a. stertens" and other members of the "alba" clade, leading to the separation of "stertens" into "Tyto javanica".
