Meilhac and HalÃ©vy were a long-standing duo with an established division of labour: Meilhac, who was completely unmusical, wrote the dialogue and HalÃ©vy the verses. There is no clear indication of when work began on "Carmen". Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating to the beginning of the collaboration. The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of "opÃ©ra comique", with dialogue separating musical numbers. It deviates from MÃ©rimÃ©e's novella in a number of significant respects. In the original, events are spread over a much longer period of time, and much of the main story is narrated by JosÃ© from his prison cell, as he awaits execution for Carmen's murder. MicaÃ«la does not feature in MÃ©rimÃ©e's version, and the Escamillo character is peripheralâa picador named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen's grand passion. Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom JosÃ© kills during a quarrel. In the novella, Carmen and JosÃ© are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that MÃ©rimÃ©e's Carmen, on stage, would have seemed "an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened".
