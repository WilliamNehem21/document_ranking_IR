"Dynamic", the main British ship still in battling condition, took up quest for the withdrawing foe and at 12:30 got the "Crown" in the channel among Lissa and the little island of Spalmadon. The frigates moved around each other for the following hour; chiefs Gordon and Pasqualigo each looking for the best position from which to lock in. The frigates occupied with battle at 13.45, "Dynamic" compelling "Crown's" surrender 45ÃÂ minutes later after a flame broke out on board the Italian ship. "Dynamic" also had endured harshly and as the British squadron was not sufficiently able to proceed with the activity by assaulting the rest of the squadron in its secured harbor on Lesina, the fight reached an end. The overcomers of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all achieved wellbeing; "Carolina" and "DanaÃÂ©" had utilized the contention among "Dynamic" and "Crown" to cover their break while "Flore" had demonstrated to every British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British belonging notwithstanding the nonappearance of a British officer ready. Once "Flore" was clear of the British squadron she set out toward security, achieving the batteries of Lesina soon after her "Carolina" and "DanaÃÂ©" and in front of the limping British interest. The littler specialty of the Franco-Venetian squadron dispersed amid the fight's last stages and came to Lesina freely.
