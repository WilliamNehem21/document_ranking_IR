A survey of the "Birthday of the World" volume in "Booklist Review" remarked that it offered a "difference in pace" from the remainder of the accumulation, and that rather than a significant number of different stories, which are set in the Hainish Universe, it "stood well without anyone else". Suzy Hansen, writing in "Salon", said that the novella enabled the peruser to envision the way toward planning a piece of the world. Hansen proceeded to state that "Heavens Lost" permitted "reality designers" to consider questions, for example, how to frame language, and what natural limitations formed individuals. Hansen depicted the connection among Hsing and Luis as a "great romantic tale", and furthermore lauded the portrayal of Bliss as a "surprising turn on composed religion", saying that the "contention [made] coherent sense". Writing in 2015, Haiven called "Heavens Lost" a "telling story" and depicted it as an "inauspicious and opportune cautioning" about religious fundamentalism, and its capacity to shape society. He contrasted the battle of the heroes with that of the rebel society of "The Dispossessed", and proceeded to state it was an "a berating exercise in both the potential and the risks of opportunity, [and] the mystery life of power".
