Laurence was a piece of the Gregorian mission initially dispatched from Rome in 595 to change over the Anglo-Saxons from their local agnosticism to Christianity; he arrived at Thanet, Kent, with Augustine in 597, or, as certain sources state, first landed in 601 and was not a piece of the principal gathering of ministers. He had been a priest in Rome before his movements to England, however nothing else is known about his history or foundation. The medieval recorder Bede says that Augustine sent Laurence back to Pope Gregory I to give an account of the achievement of changing over King ÃÂthelberht of Kent and to convey a letter with inquiries for the pope. Joined by Peter of Canterbury, another evangelist, he set off some time after July 598, and had returned by June 601. He conveyed back with him Gregory's answers to Augustine's inquiries, an archive usually known as the "Libellus responsionum", that Bede joined in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum". Laurence is presumably the Laurence alluded to in the letter from Gregory to Bertha, ruler of Kent. In that letter, Gregory acclaims Bertha as far as it matters for her in the change of her significant other, subtleties of which Gregory says he got from Laurence the cleric. It is realized that Laurence came back to England with Mellitus and others of the second gathering of evangelists in the mid year of 601, however there is no record of Peter being with them.
