A thin sagittal crest, constructed from the elongate nasal bones, ran up the skull midline before stopping just above the eye in a slightly flattened bulge. Although the complete shape and height of this structure is unknown in "Irritator", these head crests were commonplace in spinosaurids, having possibly served a display function when the animal was alive. The preserved part of "Irritator"s crest is deepest above the antorbital fenestra and lacks the vertical ridges seen in the crest of "Spinosaurus". Like others in its family, "Irritator" possessed a long and bony structure on the roof of its mouth called a secondary palate, separating the oral from the nasal cavity. This is a feature observed in extant crocodilians, but absent in most theropod dinosaurs. Also like its relatives, "Irritator" had two additional openings on the skull roof (called the postnasal fenestrae) as well as long and only partially diverging (bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate). The back of the lower jaw was deep, its rear upper surface consisting mainly of the large bone, which with the shallower bone below it. The , a sideways-facing opening in the lower jaw, was oval and comparatively large. The (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) is unknown in "Irritator", save for a possible remnant at the front of the surangular. "Irritator challengeri"s holotype is unique in that it is one of the few non-avian (or non-bird) dinosaur fossils found with a preserved stapes.
