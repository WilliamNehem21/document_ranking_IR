Ueda started working with maker Kenji Kaido in 1998 to build up the thought and convey the diversion to the PlayStation. "Ico"s plan feel were guided by three key thoughts: to make a diversion that would be unique in relation to others in the class, include a tasteful style that would be reliably masterful, and happen in a nonexistent yet sensible setting. This was accomplished using "subtracting plan"; they expelled components from the diversion which meddled with the amusement's existence. This included evacuating any type of interface components, keeping the interactivity concentrated just on the departure from the palace, and diminishing the quantity of kinds of foes in the diversion to a solitary enemy. A break plan of the amusement indicates Ico and Yorda confronting horned warriors like those that take Ico to the manor. The diversion initially centered around Ico's endeavor to return Yorda to her room in the mansion after she was seized by these warriors. Ueda trusted this adaptation had an excessive amount of detail for the illustrations motor they had created, and as a feature of the "subtracting configuration", supplanted the warriors with the shadow animals. Ueda additionally got various individuals outside the computer game industry to help with advancement. These comprised of two software engineers, four craftsmen, and one creator notwithstanding Ueda and Kaido, framing the base of what is currently known as Team Ico. On reflection, Ueda noticed that the subtracting configuration may have removed a lot from the diversion, and did not go to as extraordinary an outrageous with "Shadow of the Colossus".
