The data accessible on the attack originates from sources made in later dates, which are regularly commonly conflicting. The primary Byzantine source is the broad and point by point record of the "Narrative" of Theophanes the Confessor (760Ã¢ÂÂ 817) and optionally the concise record in the "Breviarium" of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople (passed on 828), which demonstrates little contrasts, for the most part sequential, from Theophanes' rendition. For the occasions of the attack, the two creators seem to have utilized an essential record made amid the rule out of Leo III the Isaurian () which along these lines contains a great delineation of the last mentioned, while Theophanes obviously depends on an obscure life story of Leo (disregarded by Nikephoros) for the occasions of 716. The eighth century recorder Theophilus of Edessa records the years paving the way to the attack and the attack itself in some detail, giving specific consideration to the tact among Maslama and Leo III. The Arab sources, predominantly the eleventh century "Kitab al-'Uyun" and the more compact story "Ever of Prophets and Kings" by al-Tabari (838Ã¢ÂÂ 923), depend on essential records by mid ninth century Arab authors, yet are progressively confounded and contain a few incredible components. The Syriac language accounts depend on Agapius of Hierapolis (kicked the bucket 942), who likely drew from a similar essential source as Theophanes, yet are far briefer.
