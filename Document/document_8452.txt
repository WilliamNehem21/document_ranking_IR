The collection was initially set to be appropriated under the title "Cop Killer", named for the melody of a similar name, which censures vicious cops. Amid the creation of the collection, Warner Bros. administrators knew about the potential contention that the collection and tune could cause, however upheld it. At a Time-Warner investors' gathering, on-screen character Charlton Heston stood and read verses from the melody "KKK Bitch" to a dumbfounded group of onlookers and requested that the organization make a move. Sire reacted by changing the title to "Body Count", yet did not evacuate the melody. In an article for the "Washington Post", Tipper Gore censured Ice-T for melodies like "Cop Killer," composing that "Social financial aspects were a sorry excuse for the South's continuation of subjugation. Ice-T's budgetary achievement can't pardon the terribleness of his message [...] Hitler's enemy of Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas propelled a battle to constrain Warner Bros. Records to pull back the collection. Projection required a blacklist of all items by Time-Warner so as to verify the expulsion of the tune and collection from stores. Inside seven days, they were joined by police associations over the United States. Ice-T affirmed that the melody was composed from the perspective of an anecdotal character, and told correspondents that "I ain't never murdered no cop. I had a feeling that it a great deal of times. Be that as it may, I never did it. On the off chance that you trust that I'm a cop executioner, you trust David Bowie is a space explorer," in reference to Bowie's tune "Space Oddity".
