The debate started when the business bulletin "The Jack Myers Report" brutally scrutinized ABC for selling the doll, and different news outlets revealed the disaster. Sway Tedeschi of "The New York Times" expressed, "In the charge toward online business incomes, ABC took in a valuable exercise a week ago: Don't endeavor to sell cuddly cloth dolls delineating maniacal attackers". Angela Shapiro, leader of ABC, stated, "I was inhumane and assume all out liability for it. I should have been touchy to the historical backdrop of the character and I wasn't". Another ABC official expressed, "We didn't practice legitimate affectability to the historical backdrop of the character of Todd. We have reconsidered and chosen not to sell the doll". A doll of Todd's little girl, Starr, stayed in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" remarked, "I guess ABC didn't have a lot of a decision yet to pull the item - however I need to ponder about the general population who voiced those dissents." He included, "It was a moronic SOCK DOLL dependent on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. In case you're affronted by that, how would you get past the day without surrendering to attacks of crazy shock at regular intervals?"
