Right off the bat in 1931 Fender offered to leave as Surrey's chief, to give Jardine more experience of initiative before he accepted the England captaincy, yet Surrey declined. Bumper scored 916 runs and took 84 wickets that season. Be that as it may, the Surrey board of trustees were getting to be frustrated with Fender as skipper after he had missed matches in 1930 to fill in as a columnist. Another purpose of dispute was that Fender, against the desires of the board of trustees, wanted to keep in-structure proficient players in the group as opposed to playing novices when they were accessible. There were contradictions over costs, and the board of trustees opposed when Fender announced Surrey's innings shut after one ball, to set aside a few minutes in a downpour influenced coordinate. A progression of other questionable episodes further threatened the panel. Thus, Fender was expelled in January 1932, a move reputed in the press for quite a while and which was immediately spilled. The club discharged an explanation which said Fender would possibly remain down if a reasonable substitution could be found, before Jardine was formally designated in March. Almost certainly, the vulnerability emerged on the grounds that Jardine took as much time as necessary in tolerating the position. Bumper upheld Jardine's arrangement, and vowed to keep playing under his captaincy.
