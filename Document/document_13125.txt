At the point when Martin Luther King Jr. came to Detroit in June 1963 and drove the 120,000-in number Great March on Detroit, Romney assigned the event Freedom March Day in Michigan, and sent state representative Stanley Thayer to walk with King as his emissary, yet did not go to himself since it was on Sunday. Romney participated in an a lot littler walk dissenting lodging separation the next Saturday in Grosse Pointe, subsequent to King had left. Romney's support of social liberties brought him analysis from some in his very own congregation; in January 1964, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles part Delbert L. Stapley thought of him that a proposed social equality bill was "awful enactment" and disclosing to him that "the Lord had set the revile upon the Negro" and men ought not look for its expulsion. Romney wouldn't change his position and expanded his endeavors towards social equality. With respect to chapel arrangement itself, Romney was among those liberal Mormons who trusted the congregation administration would amend the philosophical elucidation that underlay it, however Romney did not put stock in openly scrutinizing the congregation, accordingly saying that kindred Mormon Stewart Udall's 1967 distributed reprobation of the approach "can't fill any valuable religious need".
