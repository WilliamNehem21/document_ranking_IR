After a long arrangement of postponements, "Companionship 7" lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven postponements amid the commencement because of gear glitches and enhancements and the climate. Amid Glenn's first circle, a disappointment of the programmed control framework was recognized. This constrained Glenn to work in manual mode for the second and third circles, and for reentry. Later in the flight, telemetry showed that the warmth shield had extricated. In the event that this perusing had been precise, Glenn and his rocket would have wrecked on reentry. After an extensive talk on the best way to manage this issue, ground controllers chose that leaving the retrorocket pack set up might help keep the free warmth shield set up. They transferred these guidelines to Glenn, yet did not reveal to him that the warmth shield was perhaps free; albeit confounded at this request, he went along. The retrorocket pack separated into extensive lumps of blazing trash which flew past the window of his case amid reentry; Glenn figured this may have been the warmth shield. He told a questioner, "Luckily it was the rocket packÃ¢ÂÂor I wouldn't address these inquiries." After the flight, it was resolved that the warmth shield was not free; the sensor was broken.
