Principal was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Albeit both DuMont and Paramount officials expressed that the organizations were discrete, the FCC decided that Paramount's incomplete responsibility for implied that DuMont and Paramount were in principle parts of a similar organization. Since DuMont claimed three TV slots and Paramount possessed two, the government organization ruled neither one of the networks could obtain extra TV channels. The FCC mentioned that Paramount give up its stake in DuMont, however Paramount cannot. As indicated by TV student of history William Boddy, "Fundamental's checkered enemy of trust history" persuaded the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont. Both TV stations endured subsequently, with neither one of the companies having the capacity to obtain five O&Os. In the interim, CBS, ABC and NBC had each procured the limit of five stations by the mid-1950s.
