The Australian boobook has commonly dim darker head and upperparts, with white markings on the scapulars and spots on the wings. Its head needs tufts basic in different owls, and has a paler facial plate, with a white supercilium (eyebrow) and dim darker ear coverts and cheeks. The darker quills of the upper temple, over the supercilium, and sides of the neck have yellow-darker features. The plumes of the legends, jaw and throat are white with dark shafts. The quills of the underparts are for the most part darker with white spots and dull blue-dim bases. The upper tail is dull dark colored with lighter darker bars and a dim periphery toward the end, while the undertail is a lighter dim darker. The female will in general be more conspicuously streaked than the male in general, however this is conflicting and wide variety is seen. The eyes have been portrayed as dim green, green-yellow, or even light hazel. The bill is dark with a light blue-dim base and cere. The feet are grayish to pinkish darker with dull dim to blackish hooks. The underparts are pale, extending from buff to cream, and are streaked with dark colored. The general shading is variable and does not seem to compare to subspecies or locale. In northern and focal Australia, Mayr found that the shade of the plumage seems to relate with the precipitation or stickiness, paler feathered creatures being found in three disjunct regions, each around far from the other two: the western Kimberley and Pilbara, Sedan on the Cloncurry River, and around Ooldea, with darker winged creatures found on Cape York and Melville Island.
