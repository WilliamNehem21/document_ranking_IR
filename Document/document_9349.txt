Rivera went to Escuela Victoriano ChacÃÂ³n for primary school and La Escuela Secundaria Pedro Pablo Sanchez for his auxiliary instruction, yet he dropped out in ninth grade. At age 16, he started to get familiar with the angling exchange by chipping away at a business pontoon captained by his dad, getting sardines. Rivera, who worked six-day weeks, all year, called the activity "amazingly hard" and was progressively keen on turning into a specialist. Two occurrences on his dad's pontoon further approved his questions about angling as a profession. In 1988, Rivera's uncle Miguel was lashed by an unbound restrict that shot a pressure driven instrument, and after a month he passed on from his wounds. About a year later, at age 19, Rivera was compelled to surrender his dad's ship after it started overturning because of a failing water siphon and an overweight heap of fish. Following three years of learning the exchange, Rivera quit. He kept on playing sports amid his young years however in the end quit soccer after a progression of lower leg and knee wounds around age 17. Therefore, he moved his regard for baseball yet thought of it as only a side interest as opposed to a potential calling.
