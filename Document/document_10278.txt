With surveys discharged on October 6 appearing great ahead, Willkie started to sound an independent topic, blaming Roosevelt for being a war hawk. A considerable lot of Willkie's talks to that point had been on household issues, however he had been prompted by Martin, Hamilton, and different counselors that the war was the issue the voters truly thought about. Willkie started to contend that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, yet that he would. He was offered space to make this contention by the United Kingdom's expanding accomplishment in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German intrusion was not inescapable. The surveys demonstrated voters reacting decidedly to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course for the rest of the battle. Roosevelt responded by booking five discourses for the last days, in which he proposed to disprove Willkie's "misrepresentations". The president expressed, "I have said this previously, however I will say it over and over and once more. Your young men are not going to be sent into any remote war." Willkie was inclined to improvise comments, which in some cases prompted indiscretions: tending to steelworkers, he swore to designate another Secretary of Labor, "and it won't be a lady either". This mention to Secretary Frances Perkins, the main lady to hold a bureau position in American history to that point, did not help him among female voters.
