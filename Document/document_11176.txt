The first oil painting measures . It delineates Arsenije driving a huge number of Serbs into outcast, riding a steed and flanked by a Serb banner. In direct reference to the Bible, the picture is reminiscent to that of Moses driving the picked individuals out of Egypt. The incongruity, Judah notes, is that the Patriarch is driving his kin far from their guaranteed land. The Patriarch and four different figures overwhelm the sythesis, amazing unevenly over the canvas instead of moving in a straight line. "They intersperse the closer view," Filipovitch-Robinson states, "coordinating the eye through the diagonals and bends of their bodies and signal to the following line of figures behind them. Each consequent line prompts the following." All age bunches are spoken to in the work of art, and JovanoviÃÂ gives extraordinary consideration to their facial subtleties. A huge number of figures on horseback and by walking show up out of sight before inevitably subsiding into the skyline. The left foundation demonstrates Serbian warriors pointing their spears at the sky while the correct foundation indicates stumble wagons conveying families into outcast. At the correct closer view, an elderly person crowds his sheep. To one side of the Patriarch, a mother and her baby child sit on a pony conveying their effects. The lady is the youthful spouse of state army pioneer Jovan Monasterlija and the kid his child. A mustachioed warrior strolls before them with swords secured to his belt and a rifle leaning against his shoulder, "striding deliberately into what's to come". The warrior's correct arm is spread with blood and bound by a white sling.
