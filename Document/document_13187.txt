At the season of its decommissioning, USÃÂ 16 began its go through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS "Milwaukee Clipper" worked as a vehicle ship crosswise over Lake Michigan, associating Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where USÃÂ 16 proceeded toward the west. From the docks, USÃÂ 16 and M-46 voyaged simultaneously south and after that east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, USÃÂ 16 turned south along Business USÃÂ 31 (Bus. USÃÂ 31). These two parkways ran simultaneously away toward the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business circle finished at USÃÂ 31, and USÃÂ 16 joined the I-196 turnpike traveled east. (Afterward, the I-96 and I-196 assignments west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, yet at the time paving the way to USÃÂ 16's decommissioning in the territory of Michigan, this had not yet been endorsed.) The I-196/USÃÂ 16 expressway voyaged southeast of Norton Shores through forests in rustic Muskegon County parallel to the previous USÃÂ 16 steering through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The road turned all the more legitimately east in Nunica past the eastern end of M-104, and proceeded through increasingly blended backwoods and prairie territory to serve the networks of Coopersville and Marne.
