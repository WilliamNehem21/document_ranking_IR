The morning after the November 2015 Paris assaults, German musician Davide Martello conveyed a great piano to the road out before the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the prior night, and played out an instrumental variant to respect the casualties of the assaults; video of his execution circulated around the web. This drove Katy Waldman of "Slate" to contemplate why "Envision" had turned out to be so much of the time executed as a reaction to disaster. Notwithstanding its general ubiquity, she noticed its melodic effortlessness, its key of C major, "the plainest and least confounded key, without any sharps or pads" beside one entry with "a mournful significant seventh harmony that permits a modest piece of E minor into the tonic". That piano part, "delicate as a rocker", supports verses that, Waldman says, "has a place with the convention of psalms or spirituals that picture a magnificent existence in the wake of death without prophesizing any prompt end to enduring on earth". This comprehension is likewise intensified by the verifiable setting of Lennon's own brutal demise, "remind[ing] us that the universe can run ramshod over optimistic individuals". Eventually, the melody "catches the delicacy of our expectation after a brutal or dangerous occasion ... [bu]t likewise uncovers its perseverance".
