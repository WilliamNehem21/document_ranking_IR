After Rovelstad presented his structures for the coin to the Mint, they were sent to the Commission of Fine Arts for its feeling. The structures touched base on July 15, 1936, and were affirmed two days after the fact, with the solicitation that the leader of the pioneer on the front-side, in three-quarter see (looking ahead and to the other side) as presented by Rovelstad, be in profile. The stone carver agreed, and submitted mortar models by mid-August; photos were sent to the commission by the Mint on August 15. After two days, commission administrator Charles Moore wrote to O'Reilly, expressing that the stone worker individual from the commission, Lee Lawrie, had seen the plans, and grumbled he couldn't perceive what the article was behind the pioneers, and that the weapon seemed, by all accounts, to be held unadroitly. Lawrie likewise expressed that a portion of the lettering ought to be fortified, yet on the off chance that the Mint chief, Nellie Tayloe Ross, was not bothered by these things, the coin ought to go ahead. Moore showed that he wanted to postpone the coin, and sent the commission's suggestion, on condition that the Mint do what it could to address these worries. Except for conceivable work on the lettering, no progressions were made.
