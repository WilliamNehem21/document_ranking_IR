Pre-creation for "U2 3D" formally began in mid 2004, and the generation was dealt with by 3ality Digital, an organization framed from Schklair's Colbalt Entertainment and his association with the Modells and the Shapiros. Halfway as the year progressed, Bono consented to give the 3ality Digital group a chance to record test film, which was practiced utilizing a solitary 3D camera at one of U2's Vertigo Tour shows in Anaheim, California in March 2005. U2 were disappointed with their 1988 rockumentary include film, "Shake and Hum", which blended behind the stage film and meetings with show exhibitions. The movie producers chose that "U2 3D" would just have show film. The makers initially needed to shoot in Los Angeles where all the taping hardware was found, however Owens and the band chose they required an increasingly eager gathering of people. U2 at last recorded in five urban areas in Latin America from February to March 2006, trusting their nonattendance from the district for a long time would cultivate a fiery air. The just a single of the eight Latin American demonstrates that was not shot was the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The task empowered U2 to share the outside arena shows with crowds in the US, where the band just performed at indoor fields on the Vertigo Tour.
