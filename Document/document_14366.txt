The second-line territorials were brought up in September 1914 and stayed in the UK until they moved to France in May 1916 as a feature of 61st (second South Midland) Division; the 2/fourth and 2/sixth Battalions in 183rd Brigade, and the 2/fifth Battalion in the 184th Brigade. The three contingents finished visits in the bleeding edge around Neuve Chapelle, yet for the 2/fourth and 2/sixth Battalions the main noteworthy activity was on 19ÃÂ July 1916 out of an expensive and fruitless assault in the Battle of Fromelles which cost the two regiments a sum of 332 losses. In March and April 1917, the three regiments saw activity in the development to the Hindenburg Line south of the Somme. The 61st Division moved to Ypres in July, and every one of the three legions battled close Gheluvelt in the Battle of Passchendaele the next month, when the 2/fourth Battalion endured especially seriously with more than 200 losses. Toward the beginning of December, amid the Battle of Cambrai, an overwhelming German counter-assault constrained both the 2/fourth and 2/sixth Battalions out of their situations in the bleeding edge at La Vacquerie, south-west of Cambrai, decreasing the 2/fourth Battalion to two organizations and perpetrating setbacks of 16 officers and 308 different positions on the 2/sixth Battalion.
