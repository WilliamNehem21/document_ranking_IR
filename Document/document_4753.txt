In any case, Punk said the fight made little difference to his TNA profession. Creeks said the reason he and Dinero quit showing up on TNA's compensation per-see occasions was that TNA authorities trusted that he and Dinero had not associated with the fans as reprobates, having betrayed the well known Raven and rather shaped a disgusting label group overseen by James Mitchell.
