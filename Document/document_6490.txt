As per numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, "Borglum, to say it gently, was an inconsistent craftsman who figured out how to irritate most everybody with whom he worked". They note that "Borglum's past discourteousness had not abandoned him in the great graces of the workmanship network" and his plans met an antagonistic gathering at the commission. Stone carver part James Earle Fraser, architect of the Buffalo nickel, dismissed Borglum's underlying plan on July 22, eight days after they were gotten. The engraving on the turn around incorporated a tribute to Harding; Fraser regarded it inartistic. Borglum presented a second set on August 14, this was again dismissed; the commission scrutinized the structure, which appeared to be just a fragment of a bigger one, instead of explicitly intended to fit a half dollar. Borglum needed to overlook what he esteemed "damn trick recommendations", however the Association took steps to flame him in the event that he didn't total the coin. Borglum was concerned the invert was still excessively swarmed, and proposed leaving off the bird, yet space was spared when Coolidge disliked the reference to Harding, and it was excluded. With the hawk still set up on the turn around, Fraser at last affirmed the plans on October 10, 1924. On the whole, Borglum made nine mortar models for the plan.
