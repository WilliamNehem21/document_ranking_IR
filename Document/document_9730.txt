Fatigue kept on being a noteworthy issue for No.ÃÂ 1 Wing, and confidence declined pointedly in 1945 after No.ÃÂ 80 Wing left Darwin for the NEI and a large portion of the Spitfires were grounded because of cooling framework issues. Dissatisfactions brought about by an absence of chances for air battle were a typical issue over the RAAF's warrior squadrons in the SWPA, and added to the "Morotai Mutiny" of April 1945 when Caldwell and seven different officers endeavored to leave in dissent against their units being essentially entrusted with assaulting detached Japanese battalions. The Australian and British governments examined supplanting the RAF pilots with Australians or exchanging the squadrons to a progressively dynamic region, and in July 1945 Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, who drove RAAF Command, proposed exchanging two No.ÃÂ 1 Wing squadrons to Borneo to work in the ground assault job. This did not eventuate and the main activity attempted by the wing amid 1945 was an assault made by six Spitfires on Japanese positions at Cape Chater, Timor on 3ÃÂ June. Following the finish of the war, No. 1 Wing's base camp shut at Darwin on 12ÃÂ October 1945, and the three British squadrons were disbanded on 31 October.
