The Kalachuris were initially workers into the southern Deccan from focal India and called themselves "Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras". Bijjala II and his predecessors had represented as Chalukya administrators ("Mahamandaleshwar") over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 areas (covering district in present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada or Annigeri as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him "Mahabhujabala Chakravarti" ("ruler with ground-breaking shoulders and arms") showing he never again was a subordinate of the Chalukyas. Anyway the successors of Bijjala II were unfit to clutch Kalyani and their standard finished in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV made a last offer to recover the domain by recovering Kalyani. Kalachuri King Sankama was slaughtered by Chalukya general Narasimha in this contention. Amid this time, Hoysala Veera Ballala II was becoming driven and conflicted on a few events with the Chalukyas and different petitioners over their domain. He vanquished Chalukya Someshvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V getting substantial districts the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala areas, however was fruitless against Kalachuris. The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic extension too when the Chalukyas recovered Kalyani. Their desire were briefly stemmed by their thrashing against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 however they later had their retribution in 1189.
