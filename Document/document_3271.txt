From May 1980 to mid 1981 he went about as editorial manager for the magazine POL. In 1982, he moved to the neighboring territory of Victoria, and was designated the Director of Tourism. This started a clamor in South Australia because of the two states' conventional competition. As far as it matters for him, Dunstan said that he had longed to be given a job in molding and building the fate of his local state, yet that he had been reprimanded for a long time. He said that open figures in South Australia had disclosed to him that his prominent and capacity to eclipse others could have made lost face them, and hence his flight would be seen positively by them, while Victoria's offer allowed him a chance to be valuable. Dunstan was delegated to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, leaving on 23 June 1986. Dunstan remained in the Director of Tourism job until 1986, when he came back to Adelaide subsequent to dropping out with the legislature of John Cain. His retirement from these positions pursued the provocative production of a photo of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, individual from the gay network Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had propelled an accumulation of turning out stories by gay history specialist Gary Wotherspoon.
