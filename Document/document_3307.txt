Shakespeare fit in with the official state religion, yet his private perspectives on religion have been the subject of discussion. Shakespeare's will utilizes a Protestant equation, and he was an affirmed individual from the Church of England, where he was hitched, his youngsters were purified through water, and where he is covered. A few researchers guarantee that individuals from Shakespeare's family were Catholics, while rehearsing Catholicism in England was illegal.

The most grounded proof may be a Catholic articulation of confidence marked by his dad, John Shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his previous house in Henley Street. Be that as it may, the archive is currently lost and researchers vary as to its legitimacy. In 1591, the experts announced that John Shakespeare had missed church "inspired by a paranoid fear of procedure for obligation", a typical Catholic reason. In 1606, the name of William's girl Susanna shows up on a rundown of the individuals who neglected to go to Easter fellowship in Stratford. Different creators contend that there is an absence of proof about Shakespeare's religious convictions. Researchers discover proof both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or absence of faith in his plays, however reality might be difficult to demonstrate.
