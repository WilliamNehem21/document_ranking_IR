The after death report expressed Leigh's reason for death to be a broken skull and damage to the cerebrum. Leigh had been hit with incredible power a few times, including no less than multiple times in the head. The after death likewise discovered that Leigh had asphyxial hemorrhages, and numerous wounds to the jaw, ribs, liver and right kidney. Leigh had neck fingertip weight wounds, demonstrating she had been gagged before she passed on, however this was not the reason for death. Leigh's blood liquor perusing was 0.128, a dimension which, as indicated by the University of Notre Dame, would have caused "huge weakness of engine coordination and loss of decision making ability". There was no uncertainty that Leigh was fiercely explicitly ambushed before she was killed, and the proof showed that preceding the evening of her homicide she had not had sex. Leigh had profound wounding to one side mass of her vagina, broad wounding to her hymen and two tears, one long, to her vulva. An investigation of the after death by Dr Johan Duflou, representative executive of the New South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine, expressed that an unbendable item, conceivably a lager bottle, was probably going to have caused the majority of her genital wounds. No semen was found in her body.
