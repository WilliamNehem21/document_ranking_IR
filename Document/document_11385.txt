The studio's official maker, Darryl F. Zanuck, surrendered amid an agreement debate with Harry Warner in 1933. As indicated by a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Roughages, at that point leader of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck mentioned a higher pay and "demonstrated his longing to raise the pay rates of the on-screen characters and work force in the films we were delivering". That year, Zanuck set up Twentieth Century Pictures, which converged with Fox Film Corporation in 1935. Long-lasting maker for the studio, Hal B. Wallis, took over as the studio's official maker. Warner, be that as it may, denied Wallis the general forces appreciated by Zanuck, and the outcome was a decentralization of innovative and authoritative control that regularly made disarray at the studio. Under the new framework, each image was doled out a manager who was typically culled from the positions of the studio's screenwriters. In spite of the fact that Warner Bros. kept up a high rate of generation all through the 1930s, a few pictures demonstrated an uneven quality that reflected "not just the trouble of moving to a supervisory framework yet in addition the results of scattering expert into the imaginative positions".
