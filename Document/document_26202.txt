"Lazarus" has received positive reviews since its debut. According to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, critics gave the first issue an average score of 8.7/10 based on 32 reviews. The series as a whole averages 8.6/10 based on 284 reviews. Critics and fans often praise the world-building in "Lazarus", but Lark and Rucka see it as secondary and think it receives too much focus. "Publishers Weekly" said Forever's "fascinating complexity" made "Lazarus" stand out from other graphic novels. Writing for Comics Alliance, KM Bezner said every character, including the diabolical ones, displayed humanity and "[blurred] the lines between shades of morality". On "Broken Frontier", Tyler Chin-Tanner described "Lift", the series' second story arc, as "a moving tale of family sacrifice". The series has appeared on many comic critics' "best of" lists. Since the series debut, the slow pace has been a common point of criticism.
Many critics compared "Lazarus" with other genre works. The timeliness of Rucka's premise made the series stand out among dystopian fiction for "IGN" reviewer Melissa Grey. Garrett Martin wrote in "Paste Magazine" that the series was unlike other contemporary class warfare genre fiction like the novels "Hunger Games" or "Blackacre" because it is told from the oppressors' point of view. Oliver Sava reviewed the series for "The A.V. Club" and said it stood out from Image's other science fiction comics "because it's more grounded in current political and economic trends". Rucka specifically addressed fan-drawn parallels to the television series "Game of Thrones", saying he had not read the books and purposely avoids watching the show to avoid unintentionally borrowing ideas from it. Lark thinks the comparison to "Game of Thrones" works to some extent, but points out that "Lazarus" concentrates more on a single character.
