The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner named the northern gannet as "Anser bassanus" or "scoticus" in the sixteenth century, noticing that the Scots called it "solendguse". The previous name was likewise utilized by the English naturalist Francis Willughby in the seventeenth century; the species was known to him from a settlement in the Firth of Forth and a stray feathered creature that was found close Coleshill, Warwickshire. It was one of the numerous animal groups initially portrayed by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the milestone 1758 tenth release of his "Systema Naturae", where it was given the binomial name "Pelecanus bassanus". The French scholar Brisson put it in the family "Sula" in 1760, and his comrade Louis Vieillot moved the species to his new variety "Morus" in 1816. "Morus" is gotten from Ancient Greek "moros", signifying "stupid", and alludes to the absence of dread appeared reproducing gannets and boobies, which empowers them to be effectively slaughtered. The particular name "bassanus" is from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The ornithologist Bryan Nelson in 1978 bolstered the species' incorporation in "Sula" as he felt the distinctions in life systems, conduct, nature and morphology among gannets and boobies were not adequate to warrant separate genera.
