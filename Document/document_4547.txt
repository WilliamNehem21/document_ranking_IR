Contrasted with different ankylosaurs, the mandible of "Ankylosaurus" was low in extent to its length, and, when seen from the side, the tooth push was practically straight rather than angled. The mandibles are totally safeguarded just in the littlest example (AMNH 5214) and are about long. The deficient mandible of the biggest example (CMN 8880) is a similar length. AMNH 5214 has 35 dental alveoli in the left dentary and 36 morally justified, for a sum of 71, the most elevated number known for any ankylosaurid. The predentary bone of the tip of the mandibles has not yet been found. The tooth push was generally short. Like different ankylosaurs, "Ankylosaurus" had little, phylliform (leaf-molded) teeth, which were packed sideways. The teeth were for the most part taller than they were wide, and were extremely little; their size in extent to the skull implied that the jaws could oblige a larger number of teeth than different ankylosaurines. The teeth of the biggest "Ankylosaurus" skull are littler than those of the littlest skull in the outright sense. A few teeth from behind in the tooth push bended in reverse, and tooth crowns were typically compliment on one side than the other. "Ankylosaurus" teeth are analytic and can be recognized from the teeth of different ankylosaurids dependent on their smooth sides. The denticles were huge, their number going from six to eight on the front piece of the tooth, and five to seven behind.
