The basidiocarps, or organic product bodies, of juvenile "Gomphus clavatus" are club-molded and have one top or pileus, however later spread out and have a purported "merismatoid" appearanceÃ¢ÂÂa few vase-formed tops ascending from a typical stem. The organic product body is up to wide and tall, fan-molded with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the organic product bodies are secured with dark colored hyphae (minuscule fibers) that structure little, unmistakable patches towards the edge, however join to frame a constant felt-like fine-haired territory, or tomentum, over the focal point of the top. The shade of the upper top surface is orange-darker to violet, yet blurs to a lighter dark colored with age. The top edges of more seasoned mushrooms can be very worn out. The lower spore-bearing surfaceÃ¢ÂÂthe hymeniumÃ¢ÂÂis wrinkled, frequently with folds and pits, and violet to darker in shading. The strong stem, which is constant with the top, is wide, tall, and secured with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base. Usually compound, with a few organic product bodies emerging from the basal bit. Natural product bodies may wound ruddy dark colored where taken care of. The tissue can be whitish-pink to lilac or cinnamon-buff. Thick under the focal point of the top, it disperse towards the edges. It very well may be crunchy, however it is milder than that of the chanterelle. The taste and scent are mellow. The spore print is yellow to orange-yellow.
