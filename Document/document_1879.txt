Foreseeing Jourdan's turn, Charles had officially hurried his military toward WÃÂ¼rzburg, where they connected on 1 September. Marshaling the divisions of Hotze, SztÃÂ¡ray, Kray, Johann Sigismund Riesch, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein and Wartensleben, the Austrians won the Battle of WÃÂ¼rzburg on 3 September, constraining the French to withdraw to the Lahn stream. Charles lost 1,500 setbacks out of 44,000 troops against 2,000 French losses. The misfortunes at WÃÂ¼rzburg constrained the French to lift the attack of Mainz on 7 September and to move those troops to strengthen their lines further east. On 10 September, Marceau fortified the Army of Sambre and Meuse with 12,000 troops that had been barring the east side of Mainz. Jean Hardy's division from the west side of Mainz withdrew to the Nahe stream and dove in. The French government belatedly perceived the challenges in which the Army of the Sambre and Meuse battled and exchanged two divisions directed by Jacques MacDonald and Jean Castelbert de Castelverd from the inert Army of the North. MacDonald's division ceased at DÃÂ¼sseldorf while Castelverd's was put in the French line on the lower Lahn. These fortifications took Jourdan's quality back to 50,000 however the French relinquishment of the attacks at Mainz and later Mannheim and Philippsburg, discharged around 27,000 Habsburg troops to fortify Charles' presently overpowering numbers. Moreau proceeded in the south to press toward Vienna, apparently negligent of Jourdan's circumstance.
