The length of the Lord Howe swamphen has been given as 36ÃÂ cm (14ÃÂ in) and 55ÃÂ cm (22ÃÂ in), making it like the Australasian swamphen in size. Its wings were relatively the most brief everything being equal. The wing of the Vienna example is mm long, the tail is , the culmen with its frontal shield (the plump plate on the head) is , the bone structure is , and the center toe is long. The wing of the Liverpool example is long, the bone structure is and the center toe is . Its tail and nose are harmed, and can't be dependably estimated. The Lord Howe swamphen contrasted from most different swamphens (with the exception of the Australasian swamphen) in having a short center toe; it is a similar length as the bone structure, or more, in different species. The Lord Howe swamphen's tail was additionally the most limited. The two examples have a paw (or goad) on their wings; it is longer and progressively perceptible in the Vienna example, and sharp and covered in the quills of the Liverpool example. This component is variable among different sorts of swamphen. The delicate quality of the retrices (tail plumes) and the lengths of the auxiliary and wing secretive quills in respect to the essential plumes seem to have been halfway between those of the purple swamphen and the takahÃÂ.
