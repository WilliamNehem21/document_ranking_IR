The criticism did little to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of "Cleopatra", and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including "Cleopatra"), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.
In 1823â24 Etty made an extended trip to study in France and Italy, and returned a highly accomplished artist. His monumental 304 by 399Â cm (10Â ft by 13Â ft 1Â in) 1825 painting "" was extremely well-received, and Etty began to be spoken of as one of England's finest painters. In February 1828 Etty soundly defeated John Constable by eighteen votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. On occasion he would re-use elements from "Cleopatra" in his later paintings, such as the black soldier who squats on the side of the ship in "Cleopatra" and who also sits watching dancers in his 1828 "The World Before the Flood".
