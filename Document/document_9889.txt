"Mughal-e-Azam" turned into the primary full-length include film colourised for a showy re-discharge; albeit some Hollywood movies had been colourised before, they were accessible for home media. It was accordingly chosen for seven worldwide film celebrations. Upon discharge, the film attracted groups to the films, with a general inhabitance of 90 percent. Thusly, it finished a 25-week run. While a few commentators griped that the hues were "hallucinogenic" or "unnatural", others hailed the exertion as a mechanical accomplishment. Film commentator Kevin Thomas of the "Los Angeles Times" commented that while colourising was not a smart thought for most high contrast works of art, it was immaculate in this specific occasion. He contrasted it with movies by Cecil B. DeMille and to "Run With the Wind" (1939) for its overwhelming narrating. "The Guardian" said that in spite of the fact that the new form was an improvement, "the phony hues will in general look level and reckless, taking away from cinematographer RD Mathur's carefully made shots." The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, seeing that the film was "reestablished in engaging treat hues and superb sound", thought of it as a "cross between "Run With the Wind" and "Ben-Hur"". Different commentators have said that they incline toward the highly contrasting variant.
