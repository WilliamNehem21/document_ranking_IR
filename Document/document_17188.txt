Sasha reached a more mainstream audience with his remixes of Madonna's "Ray of Light" and GusGus's "Purple" for those artists' single releases. His success in pop music led him to score the music for the PlayStation video games "Wipeout 3" and "Gran Turismo". In 1999, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third edition in the Northern Exposure series, "". In addition to mixing and DJing, Sasha joined Charlie May of Spooky to produce the "Xpander EP", the title track of which many clubbers still view as "one of the greatest trance tracks of all time". He used the title track as a centerpiece for "", his second Global Underground release. Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track "Ride", which was released as a single on Yoshitoshi Records and on BT's "Movement in Still Life". Soon after, he worked with Underworld's Darren Emerson on the single "Scorchio", Sasha's first charting single in four years. In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album "Communicate" in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. "Communicate" had mixed reviews: "Spin" stated that despite a "few stellar moments, ["Communicate"] is ultimately a let-down". LAUNCHcast, too, described "Communicate" as "boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats".
