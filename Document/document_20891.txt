The Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, dated to c. 1130, contains the tale "Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus AedÃ¡in maic GabrÃ¡in" ("The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of AedÃ¡n son of GabrÃ¡n"). In this story, ÃedÃ¡n is the twin brother of Brandub mac Echach, a King of Leinster who belonged to the UÃ­ Cheinnselaig kindred. ÃedÃ¡n is exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of GabrÃ¡n, born the same night, so that each family might have a son. "The Prophecy of BerchÃ¡n" also associates ÃedÃ¡n with Leinster. John Bannerman concluded that "[t]here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions." Francis John Byrne suggested that the "Echtra" was written by a poet at the court of Diarmait mac MaÃ­l na mBÃ³, an 11th-century descendant of Brandub, and was written to cement an alliance between Diarmait and the Scots king MÃ¡el Coluim mac Donnchada ("Malcolm III"), who claimed to be a descendant of ÃedÃ¡n. A lost Irish tale, "Echtra ÃedÃ¡in mac GabrÃ¡in" ("The Adventures of ÃedÃ¡n son of GabrÃ¡n"), appears in a list of works, but its contents are unknown. ÃedÃ¡n is a character in the epic "ScÃ©la Cano meic GartnÃ¡in", but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the 7th century. He also appears in the tale "Compert MongÃ¡in".
