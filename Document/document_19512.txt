The ancestral species of the genus "Cucurbita" were present in the Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is southern Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to "Bryonia", dates to the Paleocene. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. "C.Â moschata" can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated "Cucurbita" are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene "nad1" show there were at least six independent domestication events of "Cucurbita" separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include "C.Â digitata" (calabazilla), and "C.Â foetidissima" (buffalo gourd), "C.Â palmata" (coyote melon), and "C.Â pepo". Some species, such as "C.Â digitata" and "C.Â ficifolia," are referred to as "gourds". Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus "Lagenaria" and are native to Africa. "Lagenaria" are in the same family and subfamily as "Cucurbita" but in a different tribe.
