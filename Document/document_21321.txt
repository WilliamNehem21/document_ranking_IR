The episode has been well received by reviewers. TV Guide ranked it No. 7 on its list of the ten best "Star Trek" episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" praised the episode for quickly establishing the premise and stakes, as well as turning Tasha Yar's death into one of the episode's "strongest emotional beats ... Tasha's determination to die with meaning by the end of [the episode] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad." In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a "TV death" is the episode's major flaw: "It is, in short, a scripted death, and you can see the marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is "heavy, PhilipÂ K. Dick-ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow andÂ ... all victories come at a cost", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, "Den of Geek" reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories.
