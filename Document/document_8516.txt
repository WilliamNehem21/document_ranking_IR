The U.S. had quit pitching arms to Guatemala in 1951 while consenting to respective protection arrangements and expanding arms shipments to neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. guaranteed the Guatemalan military that it also could get armsÃ¢ÂÂif ÃÂrbenz were dismissed. In 1953, the State Department bothered the U.S. arms ban by upsetting the ÃÂrbenz government's arms buys from Canada, Germany, and Rhodesia. By 1954 ÃÂrbenz had turned out to be frantic for weapons, and chose to obtain them covertly from Czechoslovakia, which would have been the first occasion when that a Soviet alliance nation dispatched weapons to the Americas, an activity seen as setting up a socialist foothold in the Americas. The weapons were conveyed to Guatemala at the Atlantic port of Puerto Barrios by the Swedish cargo send , which cruised from Szczecin in Poland. The U.S. neglected to block the shipment in spite of forcing an unlawful maritime isolate on Guatemala. Anyway "Guatemalan armed force officers" cited in "The New York Times" said that "a portion of the armsÃÂ ... were duds, exhausted, or totally wrong for use there". The CIA depicted the shipment of these weapons as Soviet obstruction in the United States' lawn; it was the last goad for the CIA to dispatch its overthrow.
