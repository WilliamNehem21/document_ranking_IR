The SCLC chose that monetary weight on Birmingham organizations would be more compelling than weight on government officials, an exercise learned in Albany as few dark natives were enrolled to cast a ballot in 1962. In the spring of 1963, preceding Easter, the Birmingham blacklist strengthened amid the second-busiest shopping period of the year. Ministers asked their gatherings to abstain from shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown area. For about a month and a half supporters of the blacklist watched the downtown territory to ensure dark customers were not belittling stores that advanced or endured isolation. In the event that dark customers were found in these stores, coordinators went up against them and disgraced them into taking an interest in the blacklist. Shuttlesworth reviewed a lady whose $15 cap ($ in 2019) was wrecked by blacklist implementers. Crusade member Joe Dickson reviewed, "We needed to go under severe observation. We needed to tell individuals, state look: on the off chance that you go downtown and purchase something, you will need to reply to us." After a few entrepreneurs in Birmingham brought down "white just" and "hued possibly" signs, Commissioner Connor told entrepreneurs that on the off chance that they didn't comply with the isolation mandates, they would lose their business licenses.
