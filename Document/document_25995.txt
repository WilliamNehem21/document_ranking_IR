"Horrible Histories" was immediately, and almost universally, greeted with critical enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of "The Independent" described the show as "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." Harry Venning in "The Stage" approved the "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" along with "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of "The Daily Telegraph" characterised the first series as "boundary-pushing", suggesting that "the bold decision to approach the series in the same way as an adult show has been the key to its successÂ ... [it] delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." James Delingpole in "The Spectator" likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effectâbizarrelyâis one of dumbing up rather than down." Discussing the first two series in "The Guardian", television writer Jesse Armstrong said that "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. You need to have everything just rightâthat's what's so terrifying. But "Horrible Histories" has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. The tone is perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".
