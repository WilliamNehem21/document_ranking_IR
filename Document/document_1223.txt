After the surrender of Worcester to the Parliamentary Forces in July 1646, he resigned to Cheshire. Going through Lichfield on his way there, he discovered that his mom had kicked the bucket only three weeks before from the plague. Amid this period, he was conceded as a freemason. His journal passage for 16 October 1646 peruses partially: "I was made a Free Mason at Warrington in Lancashire, with Coll: Henry Mainwaring of Karincham [Kermincham] in Cheshire." Although there is just a single other notice of masonic action in his journal he appears to have stayed on favorable terms and very much associated with the brotherhood as he was all the while going to gatherings in 1682. On 10 March that year he stated: "Around 5 H: P.M. I got a Sumons to appeare at a Lodge to held the following day, at Masons Hall London." The next day, 11 March 1682, he stated: "In like manner, I wentÃÂ ... I was the Senior Fellow among them (it being 35 yeares since I was admitted)ÃÂ ... We as a whole dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in Cheapeside, at a Noble Dinner prepaired at the charge of the New-acknowledged Masons." Ashmole's notes are one of the most punctual references to Freemasonry known in England, however separated from these sections in his personal notes, there are no further insights regarding Ashmole's association.
