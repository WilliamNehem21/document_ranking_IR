On the July 25 scene of "Crude", Mysterio won the competition to turn into the new WWE Champion, and quickly needed to fight off Alberto Del Rio to keep him from trading in for spendable dough his Money in the Bank. TripleÃÂ H, presently Chief Operating Officer, declared that Mysterio was to confront ex-champion Cena soon thereafter for the title; Cena won and again moved toward becoming WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced come back to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to go up against Cena. Cena and Punk later battled in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won disputably as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was on the rope and it was really a rope break. As Punk observed, Kevin Nash made his WWE return and attacked him. Del Rio at that point traded out his Money in the Bank contract and stuck Punk to turn into the new boss in the wake of kicking Punk in the head. Punk recaptured the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011; beginning a 434-day rule until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble occasion.
