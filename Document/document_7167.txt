The Imperial court in Vienna censured Daun for his inability to act; the Empress and her priests stressed that the Russians and the French would drop out of the alliance if there were no activity. Daun, a mindful and industrious officer, took as much time as necessary to make his arrangements. The Strohmberg, one of the statures adjoining Hochkirch, moored Daun's left flank, and he conveyed the rest of his power southward over the street among Bautzen and Loebau. This likewise gave him control of a critical intersection between GÃÂ¶rlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He secured the extreme right end of his line in another lush slope south of the street, the Kuppritzerberg, on the contrary side of the slope from the Prussians. Notwithstanding the nearness, the Prussians neither expanded their security nor sent their troops because of the Austrian nearness. The wary Daun additionally considered that his men were anxious to battle a fight and that they dwarfed the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made an incredible generation of slashing the trees in an adjacent timberland, activity which Frederick translated as endeavors to make field works, not, as it was really planned, to assemble a street through the thick wood. Daun additionally had found a mystery shortcoming of Frederick's. His very own secretary had been sending Frederick data on Daun's arrangements, emitted in conveyances of eggs; after finding this, Daun guaranteed the man his life as a byproduct of his participation in proceeding to send Frederick falsehood. Daun's arrangement, which he had stayed quiet, was an early morning clear through the forested areas with 30,000 uniquely picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to wall him in. The Prussian armed force would be snoozing, both truly and metaphorically, when the Austrian armed force struck.
