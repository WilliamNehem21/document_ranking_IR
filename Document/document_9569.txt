In their investigation of the case, the writers Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose express that Thorpe likely shaped the diagram of an arrangement to quiet Scott from the get-go in 1974, after the last's re-development turned into a matter of expanding concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was obstinate that Scott be executed: "[Jeremy felt] he could never be sheltered with that man around". Unsure how to continue, late in 1974 Holmes moved toward a business colleague, a rug sales rep named John Le Mesurier (not to be mistaken for the performer of that name). Le Mesurier acquainted Holmes with George Deakin, a natural product machine sales rep who, he thought, would have contacts with individuals who may be set up to arrangement with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier created a story including a blackmailer who should have been startled off; Deakin consented to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, a carrier pilot, who said he was happy to manage Scott for a proper chargeÃ¢ÂÂsomewhere in the range of ÃÂ£5,000 and ÃÂ£10,000 was recommended. Deakin place Newton in contact with Holmes. Newton dependably said that he had been employed to murder, not startle, refering to the measure of the expense that he was offeredÃ¢ÂÂto an extreme, he stated, just to unnerve somebody.
