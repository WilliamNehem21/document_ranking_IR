At the point when the stage banter started in the Chicago Coliseum on the morning of July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. In spite of the fact that met with acclaim and yells of his name, he "talked in a similar way that had won him achievement in South Carolina, reviling, lecturing his adversaries, and raising the ghost of sectionalism. He, in any case, completely distanced the national gathering of people". As per Richard Bensel in his investigation of the 1896 tradition, Tillman gave "by a long shot, the most troublesome discourse of the tradition, a location that humiliated the silver wing of the gathering as much as it infuriated the hard-cash group". He esteemed silver a sectional issue, setting the rich East against the persecuted South and West. This irritated agents, who wished to see silver as a devoted, national issue, and some voiced their contradiction, contradicting Tillman. The representative on the other hand outraged, befuddled, and exhausted the agents, who yelled for Tillman to stop despite the fact that not exactly 50% of his time had terminated. Plagued by yelling agents and one of the tradition groups, which out of the blue showed up and started to play, Tillman by and by went ahead, "the gathering of people may very well too comprehend that I will have my state in the event that I remain here until dusk." By the time he had his state, he had "adequately devastated his odds to turn into a national applicant". With Tillman's appointment stillborn (just his home state voted in favor of him), Bryan caught the chance to convey a location in help of silver that did not depend on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold discourse won him the presidential selection.
