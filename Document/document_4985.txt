Amid October 1942, "Conyngham" took an interest in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and upheld the assault at the Matanikau River, Guadalcanal. In June 1943 she joined a land and/or water capable power that later completed arrivals at Lae and Finschhafen, New Guinea. In December, she partook in the arrivals at Arawe and Cape Gloucester, New Britain. The following month, "Conyngham" took part in the arrival at Saidor, New Guinea, and cruised to San Francisco for redesign. Coming back to obligation in May 1944, she screened warships in the Mariana Islands and stayed there until August. "Conyngham" at that point joined a guard screening boats to the Philippines Islands, touching base at Leyte Gulf toward the beginning of November 1944. There, a floatplane (a sort of seaplane) strafed her, injuring 17 men yet making slight harm the ship. By early December, she had secured arrivals at Ormoc Bay and assisted with fortifications. "Conygnham" left the Philippines late in December for Manus Island, New Guinea, to recharge supplies. Later on, she helped screen a guard to Leyte for the arrivals at Lingayen Gulf. The ship took part in bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and stayed on watch there after the arrivals in January 1945. "Conygham" cruised to Subic Bay for redesign in late July 1945, and stayed there until the finish of the war. Decommissioned in December 1946, "Conyngham" was utilized in the nuclear weapons test at Bikini in 1946, and was abandoned in July 1948. She got 14 fight stars for her World War II administration.
