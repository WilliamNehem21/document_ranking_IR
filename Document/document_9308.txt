Its media profile extraordinarily overshadowed that of UKIP. Goldsmith likewise utilized his money related assets to convey a videocassette to five million UK family units in March 1997. This was a novel methodology in British legislative issues, and was imagined as a method for achieving the electorate while bypassing the broad communications. The bundling of the videocassette did not determine that it was delivered by the Referendum Party yet rather conveyed a few mottos: "The most vital video you'll ever watch", "The story the legislators don't need you to hear", and "On the off chance that you care about Britain, if you don't mind pass this video on." The 12-minute film, exhibited by the previous "Such is reality!" moderator Gavin Campbell, cautioned of a coming "government European super-state". In his examination of the video, researcher David Hass contended that the film was intentionally intended to evoke dread in the watcher, something accomplished through "spooky audio cues", the picture of a blue stain spreading over a guide of Europe, and moderate movement shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film "obviously diminished that mind boggling issue of Europe to the most reduced shared element, and expected to stun."
