In 144 BC, Viriathus framed an association against Rome with a few Celtiberian clans and influenced them to ascend against Rome as well, in the Second Numantine War. Viriathus' new alliance bested Roman armed forces at the Second Battle of Mount Venus in 144 BC and again at the fizzled Siege of Erisone. In 141 BC, Viriathus making the most of his most prominent triumph when he encompassed a consular armed force and constrained it to surrender on condition that its men did not battle in Spain once more. No sooner were sans they than the Romans reneged on the understanding and came back to the assault. In 139 BC, Viriathus was at long last executed in his rest by three of his colleagues who had been guaranteed blessings by Rome. The Celtiberians kept on opposing, constraining the surrender of another Roman armed force at Numantia in 137 BC. In 134 BC, the Consul Scipio Aemilianus at long last prevailing with regards to stifling the disobedience following the effective Siege of Numantia. In 105 BC, the Celtiberians still sufficiently held of their local force and savagery to drive the Cimbri and Teutones from Spain, however these had smashed Roman arms in Narbonese Gaul, perpetrating 80,000 losses on the Roman armed force which contradicted them.
