The most essential religious custom for Heathens is classified "blÃÂ³t", which establishes a custom in which contributions are given to the divine beings. "BlÃÂ³t" normally happens outside, and for the most part comprises of an offering of mead, which is contained inside a bowl. The divine beings are summoned and demands communicated for their guide, as the cleric utilizes a sprig or part of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto the two statues of the gods and the collected members. This methodology may be scripted or to a great extent ad libbed. At last, the bowl of mead is poured onto a flame, or onto the earth, as a last drink to the divine beings. Now and then, a mutual dinner is held a short time later; in certain gatherings this is fused as a feature of the custom itself. In different cases, the "blÃÂ³t" is more straightforward and less ritualized; for this situation, it can include a professional putting some sustenance aside, once in a while without words, for either divine beings or wights. A few Heathens perform such customs once a day, in spite of the fact that for other people, it is an increasingly incidental exhibition. Beside respecting gods, collective "blÃÂ³ts" additionally fill in as a type of gathering holding.
