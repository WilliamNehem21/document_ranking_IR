On 14 May 1904, the battleships "Hatsuse", , and "Yashima", the protected cruiser "Kasagi", and the dispatch boat put to sea to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur. The following morning, the squadron encountered a Russian minefield. "Hatsuse" struck one mine that disabled her steering and "Yashima" struck two others when moving to assist "Hatsuse". "Yashima" was towed away from the minefield, but she was still taking on water at an uncontrollable rate and the crew abandoned ship some five hours later. "Kasagi" took "Yashima" in tow, but the battleship's list continued to increase and she capsized about three hours later.
During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, "Fuji" was not damaged because the Russian ships concentrated their fire on TÅgÅ's flagship, the battleship , which was leading the column. In May the following year, during the Battle of Tsushima, "Fuji" was hit a dozen times, the most serious of which penetrated the hood of the rear barbette, ignited some exposed propellant charges, killed eight men and wounded nine. After the ammunition fire was put out, the left gun in the barbette resumed firing and apparently delivered the "coup de grÃ¢ce" that sank the battleship .
