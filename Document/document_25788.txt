At the Met (as the Metropolitan Opera is generally called), Monteux conducted familiar French works such as "Faust", "Carmen" and "Samson and Delilah", with singers including Enrico Caruso, Geraldine Farrar, Louise Homer and Giovanni Martinelli. Of his first appearance, "The New York Times" said, "Mr. Monteux conducted with skill and authority. He made it evident that he had ample knowledge of the score and control of the orchestraÂ â an unmistakably rhythmic beat, a sense of dramatic values."
Monteux conducted the American premieres of Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Golden Cockerel", and Henri Rabaud's "MÃ¢rouf, savetier du Caire". The American premiere of "Petrushka", in a new production by, and starring, Adolph Bolm, was in an unusual opera-ballet double bill with "La traviata". Monteux's performances were well received, but, though he later returned to the Met as a guest, opera did not loom large in his career. He said, "I love conducting opera. The only trouble is that I hate the atmosphere of the opera house, where only too often music is the least of many considerations, from staging to the temperaments of the principal singers." Nor was he drawn to further engagements as a ballet conductor: "it offers special problems of fitting in with the dances and the dancers, most of whom, I'm sorry to say, seem to have musical appreciation confined to an ability to count beats." Nonetheless he occasionally conducted ballet performances, and even in his concert performances of the ballet scores he had conducted for Diaghilev he said he always had the dancers in his mind's eye.
