The conceivable root of the seventeenth century white dodo artworks has likewise as of late been analyzed by the Spanish scientist Arturo Valledor de Lozoya in 2003, and freely by specialists of Mascarene fauna Cheke and Julian Hume in 2004. The Withoos and Holsteyn artworks are unmistakably gotten from one another, and Withoos likely replicated his dodo from one of Holsteyn's works, since these were presumably delivered at a before date. All later white dodo pictures are believed to be founded on these canvases. As indicated by the previously mentioned scholars, it shows up these photos were themselves gotten from a whitish dodo in a formerly unreported painting containing, called "Scene with Orpheus and the Animals", delivered by Roelant Savery c. 1611. The dodo was clearly founded on a stuffed example then in Prague; a "walghvogel" (old Dutch for dodo) portrayed as having a "grimy grayish shading" was referenced in a stock of examples in the Prague accumulation of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607Ã¢ÂÂ 1611). Savery's few later dodo pictures all show grayish feathered creatures, conceivably in light of the fact that he had by then observed an ordinary example. Cheke and Hume finished up the painted example was white because of albinism, and that this impossible to miss highlight was the reason it was gathered from Mauritius and conveyed to Europe. Valledor de Lozoya rather recommended that the light plumage was an adolescent attribute, an aftereffect of fading of old taxidermy examples, or basically because of creative permit. In 2018, the British ornithologist Jolyon C. Ward and Cheke recommended that the artwork was rather executed after 1614, or even after 1626, in view of a portion of the themes.
