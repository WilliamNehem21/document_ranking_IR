In 2000, Raymond Wilson distributed a book called "Jenner of George Street: Sydney's Soul-Winning Sailor" trying to recount to a mind-blowing tale precisely. Jenner's family had been thinking that its agonizing to have interchange records of Jenner's life coursing the world over, so they gave Wilson all the data he wanted. Wilson composed that Jenner was "erratic... the very direct opposite of the 'astute', 'relentless', and 'respectable'," yet that his life was subsequently a decent showing of 2 Corinthians 12:9, which expresses that God's "capacity is made immaculate in shortcoming." Wilson composed that Jenner's inquiry of "paradise or hellfire" was fundamentally the same as that of Arthur Stace, another Australian road evangelist who composed "Endlessness" on the walkways so individuals would think about where they would be in time everlasting. Wilson considered Jenner a battler and did not suggest that his perusers copy Jenner's evangelistic exercises "except if Divinely fitted comparably." Wilson composed that he "made a trip and related broadly to learn the certainties of the story" and that he by and by confirmed the precision of the data by recovering direct records from the majority of the real figures throughout Jenner's life. The general population Wilson met included Nancy Dixon; Ann and Angus Carruthers, Jenner's girl and child in-law; Murray Wilkes; Ian Boyden; Tas McCarthy; Peter Culver; Noel Stanton; and Mary Stares.
