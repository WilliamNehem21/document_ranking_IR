The preliminary issues of "Sci-fi Stories" in 1953 and 1954 were equipped yet unremarkable, with stories by some prevalent authors, for example, Poul Anderson, Algis Budrys, and Philip K. Dick. Once "Sci-fi Stories" ended up set up in 1955, "Future" was consigned to the lesser job, and "Sci-fi Stories" would in general distribute the better accounts of the two. Amid the period when "Sci-fi Stories" was month to month, it conveyed serialized books, including de Camp's "The Tower of Zanid" and Ward Moore and Robert Bradford's "Caduceus Wild". It additionally distributed "Virtuoso Loci", portrayed by Ashley as one of Thomas N. Scortia's best short stories. Some generally welcomed stories appeared in "Future" towards the decade's end, including "Vulcan's Hammer", an early novella adaptation of Philip K. Dick's epic of a similar name; Clifford D. Simak's "Universes Without End"; and Judith Merril's "Homecalling", republished during the 1960s in "SF Impulse", whose supervisor, Kyril Bonfiglioli, remarked "I don't trust I have ever perused an increasingly fruitful endeavor to envision a totally outsider method for thought." Lowndes did what he could to give intriguing genuine offices: a book survey section was begun in the mid 1950s, and the decade's end saw a progression of science articles composed by Isaac Asimov, and basic articles on sci-fi history, composed by Lowndes himself. R.A. Lafferty's first story showed up in "Sci-fi Stories" in the January 1960 issue, in the blink of an eye before the magazine was shut down. The financial plan for the two magazines, never extraordinary, shrank much further towards the end, so that Lowndes needed to fill space with reprints and re-utilize old outlines to abstain from paying for new stories and work of art.
