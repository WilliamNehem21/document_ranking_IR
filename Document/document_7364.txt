Isis' maternal viewpoint stretched out to different divinities also. The "Pine box Texts" from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055Ã¢ÂÂ 1650 BCE) state the Four Sons of Horus, funerary divinities who were thought to ensure the interior organs of the expired, were the posterity of Isis and the senior type of Horus. In a similar period, Horus was syncretized with the richness god Min, so Isis was viewed as Min's mom. A type of Min known as Kamutef, "bull of his mom", who spoke to the repetitive recovery of the divine beings and of majesty, was said to impregnate his mom to incite himself. Accordingly, Isis was likewise viewed as Min's associate. A similar belief system of authority may lie behind a custom, found in a couple of writings, that Horus assaulted Isis. Amun, the first Egyptian divinity amid the Middle and New Kingdoms, likewise assumed the job of Kamutef, and when he was in this structure, Isis regularly went about as his partner. Apis, a bull that was adored as a living god at Memphis, was said to be Isis' child, fathered by a type of Osiris known as Osiris-Apis. The mother of every Apis bull was therefore known as the "Isis dairy animals".
