Asher educated Barbara Avedon concerning the understudies' content, saying that it just required a bit of adjusting, and he inquired as to whether she would assist the understudies with the revise. Avedon, who had composed for "The Donna Reed Show" and been an ordinary author for "Beguiled", acknowledged his solicitation. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, "I was appalled. Storage entryways were hanging off their pivots. There was no piece of sod to be seen." Avedon communicated wonder over the content the understudies created and helped them modify it and grow its length so it would support a full half-hour scene. She guaranteed the understudies that no progressions would be made to the content except if they endorsed. It was a direct result of her proposal that the story was reformulated as a Christmas scene, which she recommended on the grounds that the content "was so permeated with the soul." She said that one of the understudies showed a longing to compose for "Entranced" in light of the fact that the arrangement manages miscegenation by method for a marriage between a witch and a human. The last content attributed the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to every one of the 26 understudies, who were recorded on screen in sequential order request.
