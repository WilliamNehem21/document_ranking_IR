Over the span of the activity, "Emden" scored sixteen hits on "Sydney", murdering three of her team and injuring another thirteen. A fourth crew member passed on later from his wounds. "Sydney" had in the mean time terminated some 670ÃÂ rounds of ammo, with around 100ÃÂ hits asserted. "Emden" had endured a lot higher losses: 133ÃÂ officers and enrolled men passed on, out of a group of 376. A large portion of her enduring group, including MÃÂ¼ller, were taken into bondage the next day. The injured men were sent to Australia, while the healthy were interned at a camp in Malta; the men were come back to Germany in 1920. MÃÂ¼cke's arrival party sidestepped catch. They had watched the fight, and understood that "Emden" would be devastated. MÃÂ¼cke thusly requested the old yacht "Ayesha" to be set up for cruising. The Germans left before "Sydney" achieved Direction Island, and cruised to Padang in the Dutch East Indies. From that point, they made a trip to Yemen, which was then piece of the Ottoman Empire, a partner of Germany. They at that point headed out overland to Constantinople, touching base in June 1915. There, they answered to "Vizeadmiral" Wilhelm Souchon, the administrator of the ex-German battlecruiser . Meanwhile, the British sloop landed at the Cocos Islands about seven days after the fight to cover the mariners killed in the fight.
