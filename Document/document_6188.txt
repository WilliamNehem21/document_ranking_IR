"Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada" is set a couple of days after "Inhabitant Evil 2", and manages Ada's main goal to recover Sherry's pendant with the G-infection test, which is said to be in the ownership of Hunk in the backstory of the dramatization collection. Ada blocks the conveyance of the memento in France, and slaughters Hunk and his men. As a result of an incidental T-infection spill in Loire Village, the goal of the conveyance, Ada is compelled to withdraw to an old manor. Alongside a unit of the French Air Force sent to torch the town, she experiences Christine Henry, the Umbrella office executive who gave Hunk the request to convey the G-infection to France. Jacob, the pioneer of the airborne unit, is uncovered to be Christine's co-backstabber. Be that as it may, he intends to keep the G-infection test for himself, and shoots her. Philippe, another individual from the unit, persuades Ada to give him the pendant, after which he infuses himself with the G-infection to enable himself to stop Jacob. Ada escapes and understands her affections for Leon, choosing to stop the government operative business and come back to him. The characters' story circular segments are proceeded in an unexpected way: Sherry is arrested by the U.S. Government following the occasions of "Inhabitant Evil 2", and Ada keeps the pendant with the G-infection and resumes her exercises as a covert agent. Hunk effectively conveys a different G-infection test to Umbrella.
