"Unusual Tales" had lost a lot of its interesting flavor with the takeoff of Farnsworth Wright, yet in Ashley's view McIlwraith made the magazine increasingly reliable: "however the issues altered by McIlwraith "sometimes attain[ed] Wright's highpoints, they additionally overlooked the lows". McIlwraith kept on distributing some of "Peculiar Tales" most mainstream creators, for example, Fredric Brown and Fritz Leiber, yet disposed of sword and divination fiction, which Robert E. Howard had advanced under Wright with his accounts of Conan, Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn. August Derleth, who had compared with Lovecraft until the last's passing in 1937, kept on sending Lovecraft original copies to McIlwraith amid the 1940s, and toward the decade's end chose to issue a magazine to advance Arkham House, a distributing adventure he had started in 1939 that reproduced to a great extent from the pages of "Strange Tales". The title was "The Arkham Sampler"; Derleth planned it to be a more scholarly magazine than the present harvest of sf and dream pulps. It distributed both new and reproduce material. A portion of the narratives were of good quality, including work by Robert Bloch and Lord Dunsany, yet it shut down after eight quarterly issues for budgetary reasons.
