In 1984, Steiger starred as a detective assigned to investigate the murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he detests from a previous case, in Bryan Forbes's "The Naked Face". Richard Christiansen of the "Chicago Tribune" referred to it as a "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [that] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be "acting in his high hysteria gear", who "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series "The Glory Boys" (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and "Hollywood Wives" (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of "The Glory Boys". Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film. Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 album "Dog Eat Dog", where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song "Tax Free".
