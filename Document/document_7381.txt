Penelope Wilton repeated her job as Harriet Jones to film a scene on , in a bungalow in Dinas Powys. Shooting was slowed down in light of trouble transporting the Dalek props into the bungalow: explicitly, the raised porch entryways made it hard to adjust and move the props. The rest of the fifth week was utilized to film Dalek-just scenes at Upper Boat Studios, when the Vault set was reviewed as the "Pot" order deck. Scenes that included Martha and Sarah in their homes were recorded on the other hand amid the 6th weekÃ¢ÂÂthe previous in the beforehand standard area of Lower Cwrt-Y-Vil Road in Penarth and the last principally at Upper BoatÃ¢ÂÂfinishing on with scenes of Sarah and Luke in their storage room. The last outside scene taped for the scene was recorded on in the standard "The Sarah Jane Adventures" shooting area of Clinton Road in Penarth, and comprised of outer shots of Sarah's home and two Daleks greeting Sarah on the way to meeting the Doctor. General taping for the sceneÃ¢ÂÂand the two-parterÃ¢ÂÂshut with Dawkins' and O'Grady's appearances: Dawkins was recorded at Upper Boat in the wake of shooting completed in the storage room set; and O'Grady was taped on close by a scene of "The Paul O'Grady Show" at The London Studios on the South Bank of the River Thames.
