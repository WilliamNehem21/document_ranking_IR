Finally the Great Sejm of 1788â92 introduced some reforms, including a planned build-up of the army to defend the Commonwealth's borders. KoÅciuszko saw a chance to return to military service and spent some time in Warsaw, among those who engaged in the political debates outside the Great Sejm. He wrote a proposal to create a militia force, on the American model. As political pressure grew to build up the army, and KoÅciuszko's political allies gained influence with the King, KoÅciuszko again applied for a commission, and on October 12, 1789, received a royal commission as a major general. He began receiving the high salary of 12,000 "zÅoty" a year, ending his financial difficulties. He asked for a transfer to the Lithuanian army but was instead assigned to a unit in the west, in Greater Poland. On February 1, 1790, he reported for duty in WÅocÅawek, and in mid-March he was given a command. Around summer, he commanded some infantry and cavalry units in the region between the Bug and Vistula Rivers. In August 1790 he was posted to Volhynia, stationed near Starokostiantyniv and MiÄdzyborze. Prince JÃ³zef Poniatowski, who happened to be the King's nephew, recognized KoÅciuszko's superior experience and made him his second-in-command, leaving him in command when he was absent.
