Amid June 1928, Leyland was chosen for another Test preliminary, playing for "The Rest" against England; at that point in mid-July he played for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground. Toward the finish of July, the MCC named the group to visit Australia for the 1928Ã¢ÂÂ 29 Ashes arrangement. Leyland was incorporated into the group; as indicated by "The Times", it would have been hard to forget him and his essence lifted the handling capacity of the side. His choice was disputable in the south of England, and especially in Kent, as he had the spot that the veteran Kent batsman Frank Woolley was relied upon to fill. One Kent supporter composed that Leyland was a "cross bat town greener". Pelham Warner, a selector at the time, guaranteed that Leyland's prevalent handling affected the choice, yet the cricket essayist Alan Gibson proposes that the genuine decision was among Woolley and Phil Mead, two batsmen of comparable age. In 1928, the West Indies visited England, playing their first Test matches. The group did not perform well, yet the England selectors picked solid groups to give practice to the players. Leyland was chosen for the remainder of the three Test matches. Making his presentation on 11 August 1928, he was expelled for 0 by Herman Griffith in his solitary innings.
