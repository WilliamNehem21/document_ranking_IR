Subsequent to floating with school companions through a couple of employments to which she didn't feel appropriate, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She was so awed with his habits and astonished at the consideration he demonstrated her that she wedded him inside three months. He depicted himself as a paper supervisor, and was 30ÃÂ years her senior, yet the marriage immediately fizzled when it wound up evident he was a scalawag. The genuine degree of his guile Marjory did not by any stretch of the imagination uncover, in spite of her genuineness in every other issue. Douglas was hitched to Marjory while effectively wedded to another lady. While he went through a half year in prison for passing a terrible check, she stayed reliable to him. His plan to trick her missing dad out of cash worked to support Marjory when it pulled in Frank Stoneman's consideration. Marjory's uncle convinced her to move to Miami and end the marriage. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be brought together with her dad, whom she had not seen since her folks' partition. Right away before that, her dad had hitched Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, an extraordinary incredible granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson (her granddad was Francis W. Eppes). Marjory later composed that Shine "remained my first and closest companion for my entire life in Florida."
