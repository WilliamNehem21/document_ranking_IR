An alternate, broadly coursed story recommends that Peel peed on the pitch before being rejected by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, recommended that "it is hard to find out reality behind this long-standing story", while Hodgson watches: "I have never been persuaded of this record since it has dependably appeared to be such a great amount abnormal for a cricketer of when so much pressure was set after carrying on 'like a courteous fellow' even in one's containers." Mick Pope expresses: "The later allegation that Peel peed on the pitch stays out of line, doubtful and such a mythÃÂ ... that it ought to have no spot in any investigation of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." The story started in a cricket production, "Cricket Quarterly", in 1968. The history specialist Rowland Bowen, in an article called "New Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", asserted that a "matured Yorkshireman of 85" revealed to him that Peel had peed and this was a typical practice at that point. Ensuing exploration by the antiquarian Irving Rosewater set up that Bowen's data came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not utilized "peed" however had really said "pissed at the wicket", implying that Peel was smashed ("pissed" being slang for tanked) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater recommends this was only reiteration of the definitely known story, not the new data asserted by Bowen. Rosewater independently published his discoveries in a book called "An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel" in 1997.
