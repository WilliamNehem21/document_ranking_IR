Hancock's most celebrated administration was as another corps officer at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1 to 3, 1863. After his companion, Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, was murdered at an early stage July 1, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, the new authority of the Army of the Potomac, sent Hancock ahead to assume responsibility for the units on the field and evaluate the circumstance. Hancock in this way was in brief direction of the "left wing" of the military, comprising of the I, II, III, and XI Corps. This showed Meade's high trust in him, since Hancock was not the most senior Union officer at Gettysburg at the time. Hancock and the more senior XI Corps administrator, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, contended quickly about this order plan, yet Hancock won and he sorted out the Union guards on Cemetery Hill as progressively various Confederate powers drove the I and XI Corps back through the town. He had the expert from Meade to pull back the powers, so he was in charge of the choice to stand and battle at Gettysburg. At the finish of the day's activity, Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum touched base on the field and expected order until Gen. Meade touched base after 12 pm.
