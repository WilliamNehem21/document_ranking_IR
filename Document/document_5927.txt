The primary explanations behind the elimination of the traveler pigeon were the monstrous size of chasing, the fast loss of living space, and the very social way of life of the winged creature, which made it exceedingly helpless against the previous variables. Deforestation was driven by the need to free land for farming and extending towns, yet in addition because of the interest for timber and fuel. About 728,000ÃÂ km (180 million sections of land) were cleared for cultivating somewhere in the range of 1850 and 1910. In spite of the fact that there are still substantial forest territories in eastern North America, which bolster an assortment of untamed life, it was insufficient to help the immense number of traveler pigeons expected to continue the populace. Interestingly, little populaces of almost wiped out fowls, for example, the kakapo ("Strigops habroptilus") and the takahe ("Porphyrio hochstetteri"), have been sufficient to keep those species surviving to the present. The consolidated impacts of extreme chasing and deforestation has been alluded to as a "Quick assault" against the traveler pigeon, and it has been named one of the best and most silly human-prompted eliminations ever. As the herds dwindled in size, the traveler pigeon populace diminished beneath the limit important to spread the species.
