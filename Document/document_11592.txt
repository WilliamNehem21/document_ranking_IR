The relationship of Strindberg and Bosse was very emotional. Strindberg would reel forward and backward from veneration of Bosse as the regenerator of his imagination ("exquisite, genial, and kind") to a wild desire (calling her "a little, awful lady", "abhorrent", "idiotic", "dark", "self-important", "venomous", and "prostitute"). His letters demonstrate that Bosse propelled a few vital characters in his plays, particularly over the span of 1901, and that he controlled her by promising to pull strings with the goal that she could play them. Amid the concise, extraordinary, imaginative 1901 period, the jobs Strindberg composed as creative vehicles for Bosse, or that depended on their relationship, mirror this mix of love and "doubt of each word, each demonstration". Carla Waal checks eight minor and six noteworthy jobs composed for Bosse to act, or as pictures of her, few of them works of art of Western theater history. The significant jobs counted by Waal are The Lady in "To Damascus" (1900; primarily effectively composed when Bosse and Strindberg met, however utilized between them to improve their closeness); Eleonora in "Easter" (1901; demonstrated on Strindberg's sister Elisabeth, yet planned for Bosse to star in); Henriette in "Violations and Crimes"ÃÂ (1901); Swan White in "Swan White"ÃÂ (1901); Christina in "Ruler Christina" (1901); and Indra's little girl in "A Dream Play" (1902). The years allude to dates of distribution; Bosse never played in "Swan White", despite the fact that Strindberg continued proposing it, and however she was numerous years after the fact to depict this play as Strindberg's wedding present to her.
