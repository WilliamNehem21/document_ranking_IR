After Godwin left England, he went to Flanders, and accumulated an armada and hired soldiers to constrain the ruler to permit his arrival. In the late spring of 1052, Godwin came back to England and was met by his children, who had attacked from Ireland. By September, they were progressing on London, where arrangements between the ruler and the lord were directed with the assistance of Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. When it wound up clear that Godwin would return, Robert rapidly left England with Bishop Ulf of Dorchester and Bishop William of London, most likely by and by taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as prisoners, regardless of whether with the authorization of King Edward or not. Robert was pronounced a bandit and removed from his archbishopric on 14ÃÂ September 1052 at an illustrious gathering, chiefly in light of the fact that the returning Godwin felt that Robert, alongside various different Normans, had been the main impetus behind his outcast. Robert traveled to Rome to grumble to the pope about his own outcast, where Leo IX and progressive popes denounced Stigand, whom Edward had named to Canterbury. Robert's own property was isolated between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the ruler, who had come back to court.
