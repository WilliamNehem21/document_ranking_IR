Land organizations kept on promoting and sell land along recently burrowed channels. In April 1912Ã¢ÂÂthe finish of the dry seasonÃ¢ÂÂjournalists from everywhere throughout the U.S. were given a voyage through what had as of late been depleted, and they came back to their papers and raved about the advancement. Land designers sold 20,000ÃÂ lots in a couple of months. Be that as it may, as news about the Wright report kept on being negative, land esteems plunged, and deals diminished. Engineers were sued and captured for mail misrepresentation when individuals who had consumed their time on earth reserve funds to purchase land touched base in south Florida hoping to locate a dry bundle of land to expand upon and rather discovered it totally submerged. Notices guaranteed land that would yield crops in about two months, however for some, it took at any rate as long just to clear.
