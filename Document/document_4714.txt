Jones was allocated to the Muncey Mission in 1841. Found south-west of London, the mission converted to Indians of three distinct clans; Ojibwa, Munsee Delaware, and Oneida. Jones had would have liked to migrate the Mississaugas of Credit here in the event that they neglected to get title deeds for New Credit, yet this arrangement was restricted by Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis. At the Muncey Mission, every clan talked an alternate language, which made the work trying for Jones, as did the substantial unforeseen of non-Christian Indians. Here two additional kids were destined to the couple, John Frederick (Wahbegwuna ("Waabigwane", "Have a [White Lily-]Flower")) and Peter Edmund (Kahkewaquonaby ("Gakiiwegwanebi", "[Sacred] Waving Feathers")). John was named for Peter's sibling John and Eliza's sibling Frederick, Peter for Peter himself and Eliza's sibling Edmund. The work at Muncey Mission was unpleasant on Jones, and his wellbeing started to fall apart. The 1844 Methodist meeting discovered him in such sick wellbeing that he was proclaimed a supernumerary. That year, Jarvis was rejected as boss director of the Indian Agents. With Jarvis expelled from office, Jones had the capacity to verify a group of people with lieutenant representative Charles Metcalfe. Metcalfe was positively awed with Jones; he made accessible assets to assemble two schools at the Muncey Mission (a young men's school and a young ladies' school) and turned over organization of the Credit Mississaugas' accounts to their boss, making them the principal Indian Band in Canada to have authority over their trust reserves.
