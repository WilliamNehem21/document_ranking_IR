He gave the hypothesis a numerical balance and brought wide logical accord that characteristic determination was the fundamental system of development, along these lines establishing the reason for populace hereditary qualities and the cutting edge transformative blend, with J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, which set the edge of reference for present day discussions and refinements of the hypothesis.
