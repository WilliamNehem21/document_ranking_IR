At that point chased after 200 years of disarray over the ordered furthest reaches of the species, brought about by the species' incredible fluctuation, likenesses with firmly related species, and early endeavors to group the species dependent on dried example material alone. A steady "Banksia" scientific categorization did not start to develop until 1981 with the production of Alex George's milestone monograph "The class Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)". Throughout the following 18 years, George's plan was slowly refined in the light of new research and the revelation of new material, and there were a few changes to "B.ÃÂ integrifolia"s infraspecific taxa. These progressions finished in George's 1999 game plan, which had expansive acknowledgment until 2005, when Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery distributed a phylogeny that did not accord with George's course of action. Another ordered game plan was not distributed at the time, however right off the bat in 2007 Mast and Thiele started an improvement by exchanging "Dryandra" to "Banksia", and distributing "B."ÃÂ subg. "Spathulatae" for the species having spoon-formed cotyledons. They foreshadowed distributing a full course of action once DNA testing of "Dryandra" was finished; meanwhile, in the event that Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as a between time game plan, at that point "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" is put in "B."ÃÂ subg. "Spathulatae"; in reality, it is the sort species for the subgenus.
