The molars are high-delegated (hypsodont) and planar, with the principle cusps as high as the peaks associating them, an arrangement imparted just to "Holochilus" and "Carletonomys" among oryzomyines. The main molars are the longest and the third molars are longer however smaller than the second molars. The molars need numerous embellishment edges, including the anteroloph on the principal upper molar, the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar, and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the primary lower molar, the anteroconid, encases an expansive interior pit. The vast majority of the folds between the cusps and peaks are open at the edges of the molars, yet twoÃ¢ÂÂthe posteroflexid on the lower second molar and the entoflexid on the lower third molarÃ¢ÂÂare shut by a divider, or cingulum, at the internal edge of the tooth. As in many oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the internal (lingual) side and two on the external (labial) side and the lower molars have a solitary root at the front and back of every molar; what's more, the primary upper molar has another labial root and the principal lower molar has a little labial and for the most part likewise a little lingual root situated between the principle roots.
