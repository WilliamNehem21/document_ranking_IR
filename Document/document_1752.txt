The first of these was "Thrill seeker" (2003), in which Affleck featured as the visually impaired superhuman. Affleck was a long-lasting comic book fan, and had composed a foreword for Kevin Smith's "Gatekeeper Devil" (1999) about his adoration for the character of Daredevil. The film was a business achievement, yet got a blended reaction from faultfinders. Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" said Affleck was "lost" in the job: "A major man, Mr. Affleck is withered by the one-dimensional job ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a lively side that permits Mr. Affleck to demonstrate his liberality as an on-screen character." In 2014, Affleck portrayed "Adrenaline junkie" as the main film he lamented making. He next showed up as a low-positioning mobster in the lighthearted comedy "Gigli" (2003), co-featuring Lopez. The movie was consistently panned, with Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" commenting that "Affleck doesn't have the cleaves or the appeal to move around (or past) terrible material." Yet Affleck has over and again guarded executive Marty Brest since the movie's discharge, portraying him as "one of the extremely incredible chiefs". In his last film job of 2003, Affleck featured as a figure out in the science fiction spine chiller "Check" (2003). Dwindle Bradshaw of "The Guardian" commented on Affleck's "self-censuring charm" and asked why he couldn't discover better contents. Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" discovered it "practically unreasonable" to investigate Affleck, given that he "had such a harsh year".
