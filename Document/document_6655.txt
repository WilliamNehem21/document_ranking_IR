In the first place, the risk of war between the United States and Soviet Union was supplanted by territorial wars among littler states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls "another key"Ã¢ÂÂ the battle for worldwide business and financial strength. She attests this new type of war is presently called globalization and its front lines are worldwide stock and money markets. This monetary fighting characterizes the foe as every one of the individuals who care about the estimations of network. "Whatever can't be only purchased and sold," Franklin states, "whatever can't be communicated regarding cash and increase misfortune exchanges obstructs the 'showcase' as adversary region to be involved, changed and prevailed."

She contends that marketeers have progressed toward becoming possessing powers served by "manikin governments who run the nation to help the occupiers." Franklin has likewise noticed that in majority rule legislative issues, the economy is all that appears to issue. "Canada has no outside approach," she says, "but instead is a piece of an intricate system of exchange understandings."
