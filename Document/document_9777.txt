Neal Scanlan and Conor O'Sullivan built up the film's outsider animals, expecting to pass on that every animal has a legitimate organic capacity and reason. Scanlan said that a lot of Scott's motivation for animal structure is drawn from normal life, for example, plants and ocean animals. Animal creator Carlos Huante made the animal structures pale to differentiate the dark conditioned, Giger-impacted stylish of "Outsider". Huante planned them to be white and embryonic on the grounds that the occasions in the film happen before Giger's impact had produced results. Huante took impacts from references Scott was utilizing to structure the pale-cleaned Engineers. Huante likewise referenced other Giger works, national landmarks, substantial models, and the Crazy Horse Memorial statue in South Dakota. Some portion of Huante's initial structure work included creating forerunners to "Alien"s Facehugger, and a crude "Outsider" animal, however these were cut from the last discharge. When structuring the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced canvases by William Blake and J. M. W. Turner, and established models. Scott needed the Engineers to look like Greco-Roman divine beings, and trained fashioner Neville Page to reference the Statue of Liberty, Michelangelo's "David", and Elvis Presley. The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were made by applying cumbersome, full-body prosthetics to the performers, whose facial highlights were lessened by the material, and were later carefully improved to save the "supernatural" physical flawlessness. Scott portrayed the Engineers as tall, rich "dim blessed messengers".
