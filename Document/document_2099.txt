The MAUD Committee was established in June 1940. The Committee was initially a piece of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defense, yet later picked up autonomy with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The board was at first named after its director, Thomson, however immediately traded this for an all the more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an irregular way. Soon after Germany attacked Denmark, Bohr had sent a wire to Frisch. The wire finished with a weird line: "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was believed to be code with respect to radium or other fundamental nuclear weapons-related data, covered up in a re-arranged word. One proposal was to supplant the y with an I, creating 'radium taken'. At the point when Bohr came back to England in 1943, it was found that the message was routed to Bohr's maid Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Accordingly the council was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation speaking to a codename and not an abbreviation. Gatherings were ordinarily held in the workplaces of the Royal Society in London. Notwithstanding Thomson, its unique individuals were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon. Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and William Haworth.
