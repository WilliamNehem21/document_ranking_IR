In 1869, the collector A. L. Lewis initially visited the site, and was educated by local people that quite a long while already a skull had been revealed from inside or close to the chamber, however that they trusted it to be that of a wanderer. A later record explained on this, expressing two people who exhumed in the focal point of the chamber without authorization found a human skeleton, the skull of which was re-covered in the churchyard at Meopham. In a 1878 note distributed in "The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland", Lewis noticed that while numerous voyagers visited Kit's Coty House, "not many goes to or ever knows about a yet increasingly inquisitive accumulation of stones at Colderham or Coldrum Lodge". He trusted that the landmark comprised of both a "chamber" and an "oval" of stones, proposing that they were "two unmistakable erections". In 1880, the excavator Flinders Petrie incorporated the presence of the stones at "Coldreham" in his rundown of Kentish earthworks; in spite of the fact that taking note of that a past pundit had depicted the stones as being in the state of an oval, he rather portrayed them as shaping "a rectilinear walled in area" around the load. He at that point incorporated a little, essential arrangement of the landmark.
