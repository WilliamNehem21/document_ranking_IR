Fusing a window and two light openings for the ringer, the pinnacle and its tower have been dated to the mid-fourteenth century, in spite of the fact that its zeniths were supplanted in 1887. The curator Edward Trollope disliked the tower's plan, saying that it "looks as though it had descended". Worked in a Decorated Gothic style, the pinnacle joins to the nave with a triple-chamferred curve. The nave has been vigorously reestablished and contains components from a scope of periods. The structural student of history Sir Nikolaus Pevsner alludes toward the south divider as "astounding" as a result of the traceryÃ¢ÂÂit is indistinct what is "Victorian extravagant" and what is "right reclamation". The divider itself is fourteenth century (Pevsner proposes around 1300) and consolidates a minister's entryway with moldings, capitals and a bust of a man; the windows to its east have been reestablished, yet pursue a fourteenth century reticulated style, albeit abnormally they include hexagons with pointed trefoils: "the most peculiar examples", as Pevsner puts it. The north path is from the thirteenth century, in spite of the fact that a twelfth century entryway sits between its late-fourteenth century windows. At the eastern end of the nave is the chancel, which has a polygonal (quinquangular) apse and was built somewhere in the range of 1862 and 1863 by Charles Kirk the Younger in memory of his folks, the senior Charles Kirk and his significant other Elizabeth. Its windows were made by Ward and Hughes.
