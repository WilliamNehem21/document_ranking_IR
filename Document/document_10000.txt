In spite of Macrinus having his position sanctioned by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus announced him to be sovereign rather, and the two met fighting at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was vanquished. Be that as it may, Avitus himself, in the wake of taking the majestic name Elagabalus, was killed in a matter of seconds subsequently and Alexander Severus was broadcasted ruler by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short rule, was killed thusly. His killers were taking a shot at benefit of the military who were discontent with their part under his standard and who brought up in his place Maximinus Thrax.
