Faultfinders and fans were by and large disappointed by the collection and contention including whether the band was to be taken as a genuine shake bunch followed. An audit in "Hit Parader" lauded the collection for "presumably [having] more a cappella agreement than on any collection since the fall of the singing-bunch period in the late 1950s", yet that "despite everything they like "Pet Sounds" better". "NME" composed of the collection: "By the benchmarks which this gathering has set itself, it's in excess of an evaluation frustrating." "Howdy Fidelity" stated: "...ÃÂ they are making the hallucinogenic routeÃÂ ... maybe in the remarkable city of Fresno. Until they achieve the San Francisco Bay Bridge or come back to the shores of MalibuÃÂ ... their work can just get incomplete endorsement." "Moving Stone" alluded to it as a "fiasco" and an "unsuccessful endeavor to coordinate the abilities of Lennon and McCartney." On December 14, 1967, the magazine's supervisor and prime supporter Jann Wenner printed a powerful article that decried Wilson's "virtuoso" mark, which he called a "limited time shuck", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called "one unmistakable case of a gathering that has gotten hung up on attempting to get The Beatles". He composed that "for reasons unknown, ["Smiley Smile"] simply doesn't make itÃÂ ... [the songs] simply don't move you. Other than showing Brian Wilson's virtuosity for creation, they are silly."
