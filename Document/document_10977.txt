Then, with the information of Vorster and the South African government, the SACA painstakingly contrived its response to the MCC letter. The answer, which stayed away from straightforwardly responding to the MCC question, was hand-conveyed to the MCC secretary George "Gubby" Allen in March 1968 by the previous South African Test chief Jack Cheetham, a nearby partner of a few MCC authorities. By this point, the MCC had acknowledged Douglas-Home's recommendation and never again needed an answer to their letterÃ¢ÂÂOborne records that when Cheetham "brightly delivered his difficultly created report, a hysterical Gubby Allen waved it away." The letter was never displayed to the full MCC Committee, and Cheetham came back to South Africa with news that an answer was not requiredÃ¢ÂÂarrangements for the visit could continue as ordinary. This permitted Vorster to cover his expectations with respect to D'Oliveira for a further a half year. Allen later supported his activities by proposing that he was worried that the SACA letter would be spilled to the press on the off chance that it went any further. Oborne trusts that Allen wished to avoid the full board of trustees the MCC chain of command's difference as a top priority over the way to deal with take with the South Africans; he recommends that Allen and Griffith were adequately going about as a mystery MCC subcommittee starting here.
