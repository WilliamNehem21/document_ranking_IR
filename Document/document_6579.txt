Verdi researchers including Julian Budden have broke down the music in symphonic terms Ã¢ÂÂ the opening segment "an ideal little sonata development", the second demonstration closing with a variation of the exemplary moderate concertante gathering prompting a quick stretto, and the entire musical show finishing with "the most scholastic of melodic structures", a fugue. Milnes recommends that this shows "a shrewd old preservationist's notice about the overabundances of the "verismo" school of Italian musical drama" as of now on the ascent by the 1890s. Among the performance numbers woven into the persistent score are Falstaff's "respect" monolog, which finishes up the principal scene, and his reminiscent arietta ("Quand'ero paggio") about himself as a youthful page. The youthful darlings, Nannetta and Fenton, are given an expressive and fun loving two part harmony ("Labbra di foco") in Act I; in Act III, Fenton's energetic love tune, "Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" quickly turns into a two part harmony when Nannetta goes along with him. She at that point has the last generous solo segment of the score, the "pixie" aria, "Sul fil d'un soffio etesio", depicted by Parker as "one more aria suffused with the delicate instrumental hues that describe this scene".
