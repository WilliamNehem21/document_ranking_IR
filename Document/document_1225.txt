Not at all like most troodontids, "Xixiasaurus" did not have on its teeth, and their (front and back edges) were rather smooth and sharp, as in "Byronosaurus". "Xixiasaurus" had four firmly pressed teeth in each premaxilla, as in most different theropods, with generally oval (tooth-attachments). The premaxillary teeth were littler than the rearmost teeth of the maxilla. There was an unmistakable choking between the crown and foundation of the premaxillary and frontmost ten maxillary teeth. The inward surfaces of the premaxillary tooth crowns were curved and the external surfaces were fairly sunken, which made a D-shape when seen in cross-area, an element imparted to a couple of different troodontids. It was unmistakable among troodontids in having 22 teeth in every maxilla (however not all teeth were saved in the holotype, their number can be resolved from the alveoli); other genera had either a higher or lower maxillary tooth check than "Xixiasaurus". The initial seven maxillary teeth were firmly pressed and a lot littler than those further back, and had particular choking influences between their crowns and roots. The external surfaces of the crowns had unmistakable furrows near the carinae, like "Urbacodon". The teeth bended in reverse and were compacted from side to side, and the bases of the crowns were less extended behind the tenth maxillary tooth. As in "Byronosaurus", the maxillary teeth were (separated), with the fifteenth tooth being biggest.
