The first Independent Light Horse Troop was a little mounted unit comprising of one officer and 20 different positions. It was raised at Koitaki on 1 April 1942, utilizing the steeds from the station there. It was initially occupied with watching and finding smashed flying machine around Port Moresby, yet on 26 June it was alloted to the pack transport job on the Kokoda Track. A remount sub segment of 6 men inspired donkeys, steeds and pack saddlery from the ranches around Sogeri, and gathered together and broke brumbies from the Bootless Inlet territory. It was discovered that the donkeys were most appropriate for the errand, with the brumbies next. Since the tracks were tight, they prepared the creatures to stroll in single record, driven by a mounted rider at the front and trailed by one at the back of the segment. Every creature conveyed of stores, which were gathered in sacks to encourage their exchange to Papuan bearers. The Goldie River was crossed over on 2 July, and the donkey track was reached out to Uberi. Pack transport pulled of provisions in June, somewhere in the range of 3 and 16 July, between 17 July and 16 August, and somewhere in the range of 17 and 29 August.
