Caldwell was talking with Carleton when he learned of the strike on the "Porte du Palais", and took with him 30 Royal Highland Emigrants and 50 mariners as he took off to stop the ambush. At the second blockade, he discovered somewhere in the range of 200 "Canadien" minute men under Voyer and an organization from the seventh Foot Regiment, who were befuddled about what was happening, whom he gave his requests to. Caldwell requested the Royal Highlanders and the state army into the houses while requesting the British fighters to shape a twofold line behind 12 foot high blockade. As Morgan and his men progressed down the thin avenues of Quebec City, they were gone up against by the mariners driven by a man named Anderson who requested their surrender. Morgan in answer shot Anderson dead while his mariners withdrew; yelling "Quebec is our own!", Morgan at that point drove a pursue the road. The Royal Highlanders and the volunteer army opened flame from the windows in the houses. Regardless of the tempest of shots descending upon them, the Americans had the capacity to put stepping stools against the blockades, yet their endeavors to scale it were altogether beaten back. An endeavor to outmaneuver the blockade by experiencing one of the houses prompted a savage battle in the house with pike against knife, but on the other hand was spurned. Under expanding substantial flame, Morgan requested his men into the houses.
