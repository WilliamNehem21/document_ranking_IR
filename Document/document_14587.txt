Congress reacted to widespread oppression racial minorities in open lodging and taxpayer supported organizations by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act incorporated some casting a ballot rights securities; it expected recorders to similarly direct proficiency tests recorded as a hard copy to every voter and to acknowledge applications that contained minor blunders, and it made a rebuttable assumption that people with a 6th grade training were adequately proficient to cast a ballot. Be that as it may, regardless of campaigning from social equality pioneers, the Act did not forbid most types of casting a ballot separation. President Lyndon B. Johnson perceived this, and not long after the 1964 races in which Democrats increased overpowering dominant parts in the two councils of Congress, he secretly educated Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to draft "the goddamndest, hardest casting a ballot rights act that you can". In any case, Johnson did not freely push for the enactment at the time; his consultants cautioned him of political expenses for vivaciously seeking after a casting a ballot rights bill so not long after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Johnson was worried that advocating casting a ballot rights would imperil his Great Society changes by maddening Southern Democrats in Congress.
