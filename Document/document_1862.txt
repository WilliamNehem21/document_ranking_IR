Holy person SaÃÂ«ns' four symphonic lyrics pursue the model of those by Liszt, however, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the "foul obtrusiveness" to which the prior author was inclined. The most famous of the four is "Danse shocking" (1874) delineating skeletons moving at midnight. Holy person SaÃÂ«ns for the most part accomplished his symphonic impacts by deft harmonization as opposed to outlandish instrumentation, however in this piece he included the xylophone conspicuously, speaking to the rattling bones of the artists. "Le Rouet d'Omphale" (1870) was made not long after the abhorrences of the Commune, however its gentility and sensitive arrangement give no trace of late catastrophes. Rees rates "PhaÃÂ«ton" (1873) as the best of the symphonic lyrics, belying the writer's claimed aloofness to song, and motivated in its portrayal of the legendary saint and his destiny. A pundit at the season of the debut took an alternate view, hearing in the piece "the commotion of a hack descending from Montmartre" as opposed to the dashing red hot steeds of Greek legend that enlivened the piece. The remainder of the four symphonic sonnets, "La jeunesse d'Hercule" ("Hercules' Youth", 1877) was the most aspiring of the four, which, Harding proposes, is the reason it is the most disastrous. In the judgment of the faultfinder Roger Nichols these instrumental works, which consolidate striking songs, quality of development and essential arrangement "set new norms for French music and were a motivation to such youthful writers as Ravel".
