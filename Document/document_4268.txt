Jack Garner of the "Democrat and Chronicle" gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, reasoning that he was wonderfully astonished at the narrative's excitement esteem. He depicted it as instructive, in spite of "Fuck"s dull utilization of the word. In "The Boston Globe" Wesley Morris remarked that the chief's cocky style was helpful, empowering him to make genuine instructive focuses to the group of onlookers. Sally Foster of "Film Threat" said that the core of the film was the discussion about the right to speak freely, and that the film was amusing and provocative. A. O. Scott wrote in "The New York Times": "Mr. Anderson's motion picture is organized as a talking-head culture-war clash between troubled upholders of respectability (or suppression, on the off chance that you incline toward) and defenders of free articulation (or foulness), yet its genuine exercise is that the opposite sides rely on one another. Or then again rather, that the proceeded with imperativeness of the wordÃ¢ÂÂits special capacity to pass on accentuation, calm pressure, stun adults and capacity as modifier, thing, action word, intensifier and what etymologists call 'infix'Ã¢ÂÂ lays on its capacity to check an edge between the allowable and the profane". In the "Chicago Reader", Jonathan Rosenbaum composed that the narrative was an entertaining film and an instructive editorial on the word. As indicated by Glenn Garvin of "The Miami Herald", the film was a far reaching converging of points of view from legislative issues, history and culture.
