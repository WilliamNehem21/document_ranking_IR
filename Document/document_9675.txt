Stephen Crane's fiction is commonly sorted as illustrative of Naturalism, American authenticity, Impressionism or a blend of the three. Faultfinder Sergio Perosa, for instance, wrote in his article, ""Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,"" that the work introduces an "advantageous interaction" of Naturalistic goals and Impressionistic techniques. At the point when asked whether he would compose a personal history in 1896, Crane reacted that he "dare not state that I am straightforward. I just state that I am as about legit as a feeble mental hardware will permit." Similarities between the complex procedures in Crane's composition and Impressionist paintingÃ¢ÂÂincluding the utilization of shading and chiaroscuroÃ¢ÂÂare frequently refered to help the hypothesis that Crane was an Impressionist as well as affected by the development. H. G. Wells commented upon "the incredible impact of the studio" on Crane's work, citing a section from "The Red Badge of Courage" for instance: "At sunset the segment broke into regimental pieces, and the parts went into the fields to camp. Tents jumped up like bizarre plants. Pit fires, similar to red, impossible to miss blooms, spotted the night... From this little separation the numerous flames, with the dark types of men going forward and backward before the blood red beams, made unusual and sinister impacts." Although no immediate proof exists that Crane planned an exact hypothesis of his art, he energetically dismissed wistfulness, affirming that "a story ought to be coherent in its activity and unwavering to character. Truth to life itself was the main test, the best specialists were the least difficult, and straightforward on the grounds that they were valid."
