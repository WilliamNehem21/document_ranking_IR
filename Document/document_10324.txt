A total "Herrerasaurus" skull was found in 1988, by a group of scientistss driven by Paul Sereno. In light of the new fossils, creators, for example, Thomas Holtz and JosÃÂ© Bonaparte ordered "Herrerasaurus" at the base of the saurischian tree before the difference among prosauropods and theropods. In any case, Sereno favored grouping "Herrerasaurus" (and the Herrerasauridae) as crude theropods. These two groupings have turned into the most steady, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod speculation, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and Benton (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian theory. On the off chance that "Herrerasaurus" were without a doubt a theropod, it would show that theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians veered much sooner than herrerasaurids, before the center Carnian, and that "every one of the three heredities autonomously developed a few dinosaurian highlights, for example, a further developed lower leg joint or an open hip bone socket". This view is additionally upheld by ichnological records demonstrating expansive tridactyl (three-toed) impressions that can be credited just to a theropod dinosaur. These impressions date from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and originate before "Herrerasaurus" by 3 to 5 million years.
