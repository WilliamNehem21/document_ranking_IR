Regarding the puzzle design in "Tales of Monkey Island", Stemmle said that he and his fellow designersâwhen they were youngerâbelieved that they needed to "stump the player"; however, Stemmle now considers it "a "lot" better to make the players feel smart". Therefore, the designers included a hint system to prevent players from becoming stuck. Grossman explained that Telltale's designers would bear in mind how players would mentally progress through the puzzles, and consider "what realisations we expected them to have and whether those expectations are realistic". Due to a tight development schedule, puzzles in the first episode were not optimized for the game's control system, which was re-designed late in development. Initially, the game was to feature point-and-click controls, as had been used in the majority of Telltale's previous games. However, a "direct control" methodâsimilar to the one seen in "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures"âwas decided upon after much of the first episode had been planned. As the direct control in that game had been designed for an Xbox controller, the developers reworked the idea into a "click-and-drag" mouse system for "Tales of Monkey Island". Telltale believed that this control method made for a less passive and more engaging player experience, and provided more freedom for cinematic camera work than was possible with point-and-click.
