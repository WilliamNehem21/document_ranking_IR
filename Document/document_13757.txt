In 2016 Senter and Sara L. Juengst inspected the paleopathologies of the holotype example and found that it bore the best and most fluctuated number of such illnesses on the pectoral support and forelimb of any theropod dinosaur so far portrayed, some of which are not known from some other dinosaur. Just six different theropods are known with more than one paleopathology on the pectoral support and forelimbs. The holotype example had eight harassed bones, though no other theropod example is known with more than four. On its left side it had a broken scapula and range, and fibriscesses (like abscesses) in the ulna and the external phalanx bone of the thumb. On the correct side it had torsion of its humeral shaft, three hard tumors on its range, a truncated articular surface of its third metacarpal bone, and deformations on the principal phalanx bone of the third finger. This finger was for all time disfigured and unfit to flex. The deformations of the humerus and the third finger may have been expected to osteodysplasia, which had not been accounted for from non-avian dinosaurs previously, yet is known in feathered creatures. Influencing adolescent winged creatures that have encountered unhealthiness, this sickness can cause torment in one appendage, which influences the fowls to like to utilize the other appendage rather, which along these lines creates torsion.
