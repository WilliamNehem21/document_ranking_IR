Unknown to the Franciscans, the northern ChakÊ¼an Itza province of the Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza king. The ChakÊ¼an Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing. The following day, the current Aj Kan EkÊ¼ travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the ChakÊ¼an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake PetÃ©n Itza. The Franciscans returned to NojpetÃ©n with Kan EkÊ¼ and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. AvendaÃ±o tried to convince Kan EkÊ¼ to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the KÊ¼atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.
