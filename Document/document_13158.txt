California State Senator John Briggs saw an open door in the Christian fundamentalists' crusade. He was wanting to be chosen legislative leader of California in 1978, and was awed with the voter turnout he found in Miami. At the point when Briggs came back to Sacramento, he composed a bill that would restrict gays and lesbians from educating in state funded schools all through California. Briggs guaranteed in private that he didn't have anything against gays, telling gay columnist Randy Shilts, "It's legislative issues. Just governmental issues." Random assaults on gays ascended in the Castro. At the point when the police reaction was viewed as deficient, gatherings of gays watched the area themselves, on alarm for assailants. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough kicked the bucket from 15 cut injuries while his aggressors assembled around him and recited "Faggot!" Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mom accused Anita Bryant and John Briggs. Multi week before the episode, Briggs had held a question and answer session at San Francisco City Hall where he considered the city a "sexual rubbish pile" as a result of gay people. Weeks after the fact, 250,000ÃÂ people went to the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the biggest participation at any Gay Pride occasion to that point.
