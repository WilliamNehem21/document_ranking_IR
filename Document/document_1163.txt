The breakdown left Barnett and chief Yardley as the new men at the wrinkle. The two players assaulted the bowling yet couldn't get their shots through the field for runs. Before long, Lindwall was compelled to leave the field because of crotch damage and did not bowl once more. Barnett hit one four preceding Johnston bowled him for eight off within edge as he inclined onto the front foot. This conveyed Evans to the wrinkle with the score at 60/6, and he endeavored to disturb the Australians' line and length by counter-assaulting with a progression of shots before the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the limit for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston difficult to cover, however the catch experienced Bradman for another limit. The additional opportunity of a catch experienced Bradman's hand and struck the Australian skipper in the midriff. Be that as it may, the botched chances cost the sightseers little; Evans hit a ball emphatically however it was gotten at short proximity at short leg by Morris. Moving along without any more expansion to the score, Toshack caught Yardley, who had waited at the wrinkle for 26 minutes in gathering three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that rectified in the wake of pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.
