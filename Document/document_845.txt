Endless supply of the Australian Air Board on 9ÃÂ November 1920, Williams and his individual AAC officers dropped their military positions for those dependent on the Royal Air Force. Williams, presently a wing administrator, by and by ordered and postponed the Air Board's entries to make the Australian Air Force (AAF), an administration autonomous of both the Army and the Royal Australian Navy. In spite of the fact that the leaders of the Army and Navy restricted the formation of an autonomous air arm for dread that they would be unfit to discover air spread for their activities, support from Prime Minister Billy Hughes, just as conspicuous parliamentary figures including Treasurer Joseph Cook and Defense Minister George Pearce enabled the proposition to succeed. The AAF was appropriately framed on 31ÃÂ March 1921; Williams intentionally picked this day as opposed to 1 April, the establishing date of the RAF three years sooner, "to forestall frightful individuals alluding to us as 'April Fools'". The "Illustrious" prefix was included five months after the fact. Williams proposed an ensign for the AAF in July 1921, in light of the Royal Air Force banner however including the five stars of the Southern Cross inside the RAF roundel and the Commonwealth Star in the lower raise quarter. This structure was not embraced for the RAAF, the legislature utilizing rather an immediate duplicate of the RAF ensign until 1949, when another plan utilizing the stars of the Australian Flag was picked.
