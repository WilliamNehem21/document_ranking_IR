The "Lion"- class battlecruisers were intended to be as better than the new German battlecruisers of the "Moltke" class as the German boats were to the "Invulnerable" class. The expansion in speed, shield and weapon estimate constrained a 40% increment in size over the "Inexhaustible" class and made them the biggest warships on the planet. Their format was adjusted from the plan of the main "super-gunboat" class, the s of 1910, with 13.5-inch (343ÃÂ mm) firearms. The boats were the principal battlecruisers to be equipped with the new 13.5-inch Mk V weapon. The plan of the "Lions" helped a portion of the inadequacies of the first battlecruisers, which experienced a powerlessness of the "en echelon" amidships turrets to securely fire crosswise over deck, restricting them to a three-turret broadside. This was done in light of the fact that the more prominent size and weight of the new firearms rendered wing turrets impracticable. In that capacity, every one of the four turrets in the "Lion"s were orchestrated on the centreline; 'Q' turret was found amidships and could just fire on the broadside. The Director of Naval Construction, Sir Philip Watts, proposed that a fifth turret, superfiring over the back turret, could be included if the ship was extended by three edges, altogether, and this would include next to no cost other than the ÃÂ£175,000 for the extra turret, however add 25% more capability to the ship. This was not affirmed, conceivably due to questions about its achievability.
