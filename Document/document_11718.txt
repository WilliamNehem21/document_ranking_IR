One exercise learned in China was the significance of focus and mass in anticipating maritime air control aground. Along these lines, in April 1941 the IJN framed the First Air Fleet to consolidate the majority of its armada transporters under a solitary order. On 10 April 1941 "Kaga" was appointed to the First Carrier Division with "Akagi" as a component of the new bearer armada, which additionally incorporated the Second and Fifth transporter divisions.

Along these lines, the IJN built up a trade off arrangement in which the armada bearers would work firmly together inside their transporter divisions however the divisions themselves would work in free rectangular developments, with around isolating the bearers from one another.
