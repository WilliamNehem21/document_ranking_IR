In 1953 Bolikango turned into a substitute individual from the Conseil de la region de LÃÂ©opoldville. He served in the post for a long time. In December 1957 he fruitlessly entered LÃÂ©opoldville's first civil decisions. The Bangala in general did not do well in the battle; their solitary type of association was Bolikango's Liboka Lya Bangala, a relationship with little union. Following the constituent thrashings, Bolikango chose to sort out the InterfÃÂ©dÃÂ©rale, a league among different territorial and ethnic gatherings of the northern Congo that turned into the premise of his new Parti de l'unitÃÂ© Congolaise. Very quickly after its creation the gathering fallen because of ethnic contrasts. In April 1959 Patrice Lumumba solicited Bolikango to move toward becoming executive from his patriot ideological group, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), yet he never dedicated to a choice. In the harvest time of 1959 the InterfÃÂ©dÃÂ©rale turned into a piece of the Parti National du ProgrÃÂ¨s (PNP). Bolikango did not tail them, rather establishing the Front de l'unite Bangala (FUB), an ideological group speaking to the Bangala individuals of the northeastern Congo. Among them he was a well known figure; Bangala epithets for him included "the Sage" and even "Moses". He trusted that by advancing the possibility of a "grande ethnie bangala" he could improve his political prospects. The Bangala were just brought together as a political group in the capital, so he started to search somewhere else for help. He was additionally a fellow benefactor of the brief Mouvement pour le Progres National Congolais, a gathering framed by participants of the Brussels piece.
