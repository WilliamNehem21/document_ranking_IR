Although most of Saint-SaÃ«ns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as "a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-SaÃ«ns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music â "lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable." Stylistically, Saint-SaÃ«ns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for "Henry VIII" he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in "La princesse jaune" he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-SaÃ«ns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers. In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-SaÃ«ns "certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of "Aida", and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style."
