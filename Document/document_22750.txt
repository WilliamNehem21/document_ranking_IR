"Oxalaia" stems from the AlcÃ¢ntara Formation, a succession of sedimentary rocks that is part of the Itapecuru Group of the SÃ£o LuÃ­s-GrajaÃº Basin, in northeastern Brazil. These rocks have been dated by scientists to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Outcropping at the northern coast of the formation, the Laje do Coringa locality is made up mostly of sandstones and mudstones, along with conglomerate rock layers containing fossil plant and vertebrate fragments. These sediments were deposited under marine and fluvial conditions similar to those of the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, where "Spinosaurus" remains have been found. In 1999, fossils of "Oxalaia" were recovered from the Laje do Coringa. Palaeontologist Elaine Machado, of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, was surprised to find such a well-preserved fossil at the site and stated in a press release that "this is how most scientific discoveries happen, it was by accident". The finding was a rare occurrence due to the erosive nature of the tides at the deposit, which are responsible for the fragmented state of most fossils in the bone bed; remains not found on site are often removed from the formation by wave action. Generally, the majority of fossil remains found at the AlcÃ¢ntara Formation consist of teeth and isolated skeletal elements, of which the Laje do Coringa site has yielded hundreds.
