While VT-3 was all the while assaulting "HiryÃÂ«", American jump aircraft touched base over the Japanese transporters practically undetected and started their plunges. It was as of now, around 10:20, that in the expressions of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the "Japanese air protections would at long last and disastrously fall flat." Three American plunge plane squadrons presently assaulted the three different bearers and set every one of them ablaze. "HiryÃÂ«" was immaculate and continued to dispatch 18 D3As, escorted by 6 Zeros, at 10:54 and a second influx of 10 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, at 13:30 against the American bearer . "In transit", the Zeros drew in a gathering of "Enterprise"s Dauntlesses that they had spotted. They neglected to shoot down any of the plunge aircraft, yet two of the Zero were shot up by the planes' back heavy armament specialists, with one Zero compelled to dump almost a destroyer. American radar distinguished the approaching Japanese jump planes at 11:52 and vectored "Yorktown"s CAP of 20 Wildcats against them. The Wildcats shot down three of the staying Zeros for the loss of one of their own and connected with the D3As. Just seven of the jump planes endure sufficiently long to make their assault on "Yorktown" and two of those were shot somewhere around fire amid their plunge, yet they made three direct hits and two close misses that seriously harmed the transporter and set her ablaze.
