The structures were conveyed to the VVKJ in time for endorsement by mid-1936, yet a general hesitance to embrace new ideas deferred the IK-3, and an agreement for the creation of the model was not marked until March 1937. The organization chose for development was RogoÃÂ¾arski A.D. in Belgrade. The principal trip of the model was completed by the VVKJ Test Group towards the finish of May 1938 and the flying machine was then flown by a gathering of VVKJ officers who were to decide the best work for it inside the VVKJ, alongside strategies to be utilized in Yugoslav conditions. These pilots saw that the controls were profoundly touchy; the main genuine reactions identified with the visual bending brought about by the bended boards of the shade. A few pilots trusted that the fuselage-mounted deadly implement ought to be enhanced by two wing-mounted automatic weapons. The aircraft testers likewise needed to look at the execution of the IK-3 with the Hawker Fury, Heinkel He 112, Morane-Saulnier M.S. 405 and Hawker Hurricane. They presumed that the IK-3 most firmly coordinated the Morane-Saulnier; the Yugoslav airplane was quicker. In November 1938, the VVKJ submitted a request with RogoÃÂ¾arski for 12 air ship.
