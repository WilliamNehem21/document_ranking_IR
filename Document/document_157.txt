A large portion of the collection's verses were composed by Static, from the R&B band Playa. While the band was developing separated, he was welcomed by Blackground to be a lead essayist for the collection subsequent to expressing "Are You That Somebody?" and "Attempt Again". Static was a piece of Aaliyah's nearby gathering of companions, which included Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and imparted a captivation to her. He observed Aaliyah to be perfect for his songwriting style, while she trusted that he could precisely depict her emotions. A quietly sexual lyricist, he expressed "Raise some static" for her in 1999, yet Blackground felt she was not prepared for the melody. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, "We generally were defensive over each lyricÃÂ ... Be that as it may, he did things where you never felt affronted. You just felt like you caught somebody thinkingÃÂ ... he was cleverÃÂ ... Aaliyah relied upon him [and] he relied upon her." Elliott said that he was "a piece of that extension of Aaliyah growing up melodiously". While she examined the verses with Static, the artist counseled Bud'da about the sound and melodic course of the collection. She was keen on finding out about the UK carport scene at the time.
