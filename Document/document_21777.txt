Only the rear part of the skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout equipped with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the (eye opening), which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The , located below the orbit, was long and narrow. Behind the orbit was the , which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located in front of the eye opening, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with "Dicraeosaurus" but absent in most other sauropods included the fused and the notably long , bony extensions connecting the with the .
