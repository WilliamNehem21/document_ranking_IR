"Paul Kruger's name and notoriety he made himself", Leyds said. "It is here and there said that he was unskilled. This is obviously nonsenseÃÂ ... He was surely not adapted, yet he had a careful learning of numerous things." "In the lower circles of strategy Mr Kruger was an ace", EÃÂ B Iwan-MÃÂ¼ller stated. "He was speedy in identifying the bogus moves made by his adversaries, and a skilled in swinging them further bolstering his own good fortune; yet of the extensive blends he was pitifully unable. To verify a splendid and prominent achievement today he was prepared to waste the possibilities of things to come, assuming, without a doubt, he had the intensity of anticipating them. He was what I trust fighters would call a splendid strategist, yet a miserable strategist." Soon after Kruger's passing, Smuts told the British compassionate campaigner Emily Hobhouse: "He epitomized the Boer character both in its more splendid and darker perspectives, and was no uncertainty the best manÃ¢ÂÂboth ethically and mentallyÃ¢ÂÂwhom the Boer race has so far created. In his iron will and determination, his 'never incredible' towards destiny, his spiritualist confidence in a different universe, he spoke to what is best within each one of us."
