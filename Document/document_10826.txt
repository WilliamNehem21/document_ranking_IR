Exmoor is an upland territory framed only from sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the topographical period and framework, 'Devonian', originates from Devon, as rocks of that age were first considered and depicted here. Except for a suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks shaping the lower ground among Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (inside Exmoor National Park yet fringe to the field itself), the majority of the strong rocks of Exmoor are allocated to the Exmoor Group, which includes a blend of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be recognized in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne region exhibits the Trentishoe Member (some time ago 'Arrangement') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (some time ago 'Gathering'). The Hangman Sandstone speaks to the Middle Devonian grouping of North Devon and Somerset. These surprising freshwater stores in the Hangman Grits were for the most part framed in desert conditions. As this territory of Britain was not expose to glaciation, the level stays as an amazingly old landform. The bedrock and later shallow stores are canvassed to a limited extent by moorland which is bolstered by wet, corrosive soil.
