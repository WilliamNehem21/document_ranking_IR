Not all audits were basic. Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", composed a fairly positive audit of the scene. He noticed that, while the scene "revealed to us nothing of essentialness" in regards to the "master plan" folklore story curve, the opportunity to see Mulder and Scully together one final time brought about "a dazzling Mulder-Scully minute". He was especially satisfied with the last scene, taking note of that it was a suitable end; he called it "fitting", just as "brilliant". Kessenich kept up that, were it not for the arrival of Duchovny, "no one would have cared the slightest bit about the finish of this arrangement." Julie Salamon of "The New York Times" gave the scene a positive audit. Salamon noticed that "Until the end, the arrangement kept up its entrancing visual melancholy, shrewdly punctuated with suggestive plays of shading and light". She asserted the show "likewise held its fear inspired notion heart that has advanced so extraordinarily to watchers". John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions applauded the scene, expressing "The Truth is a wonderful end to the arrangement, with a lot of wanders aimlessly, a couple of shock visitor appearances, and a dangerous finale complete with essential dark helicopters. The sentimental people among us will likewise be satisfied with the climax of the Mulder/Scully relationship".
