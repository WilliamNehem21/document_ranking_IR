In the meantime, the negotiations allowed time for loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u, a future president, brought infantry forces from BiÃªn HÃ²a, a town north of Saigon. The Seventh Division of Colonel Tráº§n Thiá»n KhiÃªm brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from Má»¹ Tho, a town in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon. KhiÃªm was a Catholic with ties to Diá»m's older brother, Archbishop NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Thá»¥c. Khanh also convinced LÃª NguyÃªn Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of TÃ¢y Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyá»n ÄÃ¬nh Thuáº­n phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diá»m can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If one side or the other has to make some concessions in order [to] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists." Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime.
