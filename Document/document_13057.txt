The next day, Hendrix got a telephone call from one of his lady friends, Devon Wilson, who had turned out to be envious subsequent to hearing bits of gossip that he was dating another lady, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer reviewed: "I heard Jimi converse with DevonÃÂ ... she was madÃÂ ... she went into fitsÃÂ ... Jimi said 'Devon, take a deep breath and relax'". Hendrix was booked to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, however the show, alongside three others, was dropped because of Cox's debilitation. Amid the night of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. In the wake of advising him that she would need to return to work that night, he persuaded her to telephone her supervisor, performer George Lazenby, and request the night off. Lazenby wound up irate and yelled via telephone to Nefer: "You're only a screwing groupie", which Hendrix caught. The trade upset him, and he told Nefer: "Don't you ever go out to that person again". Nefer disclosed to him that she had gone through a half year taking a shot at a film with Lazenby and that she would not like to leave her place of employment; Hendrix in the long run concurred. Nefer went through the night with him and left in the first part of the day.
