The Disney pictures originally distributed by RKO are owned and fully controlled by The Walt Disney Company. Rights to many other independent productions distributed by the studio, as well as some notable coproductions, are in new hands. Most Samuel Goldwyn films are administered by Warner Bros. in North America and Miramax internationally. "It's a Wonderful Life", coproduced by Frank Capra's Liberty Films, and "The Bells of St. Mary's", coproduced by Leo McCarey's Rainbow Productions, are now owned by Viacom, through its indirect acquisition of Republic Pictures, the former National Telefilm Associates. "Notorious", a coproduction between RKO and David Selznick's Vanguard Films, is now owned by Disney, while home video rights are currently controlled by MGM. "The Stranger", from William Goetz's International Pictures, has been in the public domain since 1973. Eighteen films produced by RKO itself in 1930â31, including "Dixiana", were also allowed to fall into the public domain, as were several later in-house productions, including high-profile releases such as "The Animal Kingdom", "Bird of Paradise," "Of Human Bondage", "Love Affair", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", and "They Knew What They Wanted". In the late 1950s, Hughes bought his beloved "Jet Pilot" and "The Conqueror" back from RKO Teleradio; in 1979, Universal acquired the rights to the latter.
