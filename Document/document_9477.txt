Gondwanatheres are a little gathering of warm blooded animals of questionable phylogenetic affinities known from the late Cretaceous to the Eocene (~56Ã¢ÂÂ 34 mya) of the Gondwanan mainlands, known just from teeth and a couple of lower jaws. Upon their disclosure during the 1980s, gondwanatheres were at first idea to be xenarthransÃ¢ÂÂsome portion of a similar gathering as living sloths, armadillos, and insect eating animalsÃ¢ÂÂyet later laborers have favored affinities with multituberculates (a differing gathering of fossil vertebrates) or left the connections of the gondwanatheres open. The gathering includes two families. The family Ferugliotheriidae, whose individuals had low-delegated teeth, happens in the Campanian (~84Ã¢ÂÂ 71 mya) to Maastrichtian of Argentina. All different gondwanatheres, including "Lavanify", are set in the Sudamericidae, which have high-delegated (hypsodont) teeth. These incorporate "Gondwanatherium" from the Campanian and Maastrichtian of Argentina; "Sudamerica" from the Paleocene (~66Ã¢ÂÂ 56 mya) of Argentina; "Lavanify"; somewhere around one species from the Maastrichtian of India; an anonymous species identified with "Sudamerica" from the Eocene of Antarctica; and an anonymous conceivable gondwanathere, TNM 02067, from the Cretaceous of Tanzania. In 2007, groups driven by G.P. Wilson and G.V.R. Prasad freely portrayed this creature as "Dakshina" and "Bharattherium" separately; as the last name was distributed first, it is the right name for this sort as indicated by the Principle of Priority. Gondwanatheres have been translated as benefiting from roots, bark, and rough vegetation or as the most punctual grass-eating warm blooded creatures.
