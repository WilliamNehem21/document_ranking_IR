The line of the Beauchamp Earls finished in 1449 when Anne de Beauchamp, fifteenth Countess of Warwick, kicked the bucket. Richard Neville, the "Kingmaker", turned into the following Earl of Warwick through his significant other's legacy of the title. Amid the mid year of 1469, Neville defied King Edward IV of England and detained him in Warwick Castle. Neville endeavored to govern in the King's name; be that as it may, steady dissents by the King's supporters constrained the Earl to discharge King Edward IV. Neville was in this way slaughtered in the Battle of Barnet, battling against the King in 1471 amid the Wars of the Roses. Warwick Castle at that point go from Neville to his child in-law, George Plantagenet, first Duke of Clarence (sibling of King Edward IV). George Plantagenet was executed in 1478, and his territories passed onto his child, Edward Plantagenet, seventeenth Earl of Warwick; in any case, Edward Plantagenet was just two when his dad kicked the bucket, so his properties were taken in the guardianship of The Crown. He was put under attainder, thus couldn't acquire the royal position, by King Henry VII of England, being held by the King for a long time in the Tower of London until he was executed for high conspiracy in 1499, as far as anyone knows for scheming to escape with the 'actor' Perkin Warbeck. Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.
