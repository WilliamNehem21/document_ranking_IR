Other than studio work force, just twelve individuals saw the first 42-reel variant of "Voracity" at an uncommon screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all concurred that they had quite recently observed the best film at any point made and that it was improbable that a superior film could ever be made. Carr composed an audit of the development screening where he raved that he "saw a great picture recentlyÃ¢ÂÂthat nobody else will ever seeÃÂ  ... I can't envision what they will do with it. It resembles "Les Miserables". Scenes tag along that you think make little difference to the story, at that point 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with an accident. For obvious, horrible authenticity and heavenly imaginativeness, it is the best picture I have ever observed. Yet, I don't have a clue what it will resemble when it psychologists to 8 reels." Jonathan Rosenbaum proposed that Carr was doubtlessly alluding to a cut grouping right off the bat in the film that presented the majority of the characters who lived in McTeague's structure. The forty-minute scene delineated what the occupants did on a Saturday evening, and built up true to life climate without encouraging the plot. Rosenbaum contrasted the cut arrangement with books of the nineteenth century and to the initial couple of long stretches of Jacques Rivette's "Out 1". Jones openly adulated the development screening and looked at "Ravenousness" to "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler". Be that as it may, Welford Beaton of "The Film Spectator" loathed the 42-reel form and reprimanded its unreasonable utilization of close-ups.
