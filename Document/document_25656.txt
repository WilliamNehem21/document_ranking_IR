Directly after commissioning, "Prinzregent Luitpold" took part in the annual autumn maneuvers, which followed the fleet cruise to Norway. The exercises lasted from 31Â August to 9Â September. Unit drills and individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, "Prinzregent Luitpold" participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship went to Kiel Week that year. Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28Â June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13Â July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25Â July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.
