After Napoleon's thrashing, the Congress of Vienna built up another European political-strategic framework dependent on the parity of intensity. This framework rearranged Europe into ranges of prominence, which, now and again, stifled the desires of the different nationalities, including the Germans and Italians. For the most part, an expanded Prussia and the 38 different states merged from the mediatized regions of 1803 were confederated inside the Austrian Empire's authoritative reach. The Congress built up a free German Confederation (1815Ã¢ÂÂ 1866), headed by Austria, with a "Government Diet" (called the "Bundestag" or "Bundesversammlung", a gathering of designated pioneers) that met in the city of Frankfurt am Main. In acknowledgment of the royal position generally held by the Habsburgs, the sovereigns of Austria turned into the main leaders of this parliament. Dangerously, the inherent Austrian strength neglected to consider Prussia's eighteenth century development in Imperial legislative issues. As far back as the Prince-Elector of Brandenburg had made himself King in Prussia toward the start of that century, their areas had relentlessly expanded through war and legacy. Prussia's combined quality had turned out to be particularly clear amid the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War under Frederick the Great. As Maria Theresa and Joseph endeavored to reestablish Habsburg authority in the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick countered with the production of the "FÃÂ¼rstenbund" (Union of Princes) in 1785. Austrian-Prussian dualism lay solidly established in old Imperial governmental issues. Those equalization of intensity manoeuvers were embodied by the War of the Bavarian Succession, or "Potato War" among regular people. Indeed, even after the finish of the Holy Roman Empire, this challenge affected the development and improvement of patriot developments in the nineteenth century.
