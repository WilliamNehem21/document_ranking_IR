One theme of discourse was the bill's necessity that a falcon show up on bigger U.S. coins. Linderman had mentioned a change to necessitate that gold and silver coins bear an announcement of their weight and fineness, which would mean giving up the falcon. California's Eugene Casserly restricted the alteration, which was supported by Sherman, expressing "it will barely be conceivable to think about a half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the bird upon it". The hawk was spared when the alteration fizzled, 24 in support and 26 against. Casserly was less effective with a change to evacuate the diminished coinage charge of .2 percent, which fizzled. Sherman moved the bill along as fast as possible, and it go without a recorded vote. The House at first would not consent to the Trade dollar; delegates of the two houses, driven by Sherman and Potter, met in a meeting advisory group, and the House agreed to the Senate alteration for the Trade dollar. The bill passed the two houses moving forward without any more discussion, and was marked by President Ulysses S. Allow on February 12, 1873. At no time in its right around three-year venture through the authoritative procedure did the bill accommodate the maintenance of the standard silver dollar, into which contributors could have their bullion begat.
