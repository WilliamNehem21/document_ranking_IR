On race day, the track was quick, and the climate was warm and bright. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham surged up close to him. The two ran the primary quarter in a speedy :23 and the following quarter in a quick :22, finishing the quickest opening half mile ever of race and opening ten lengths on the remainder of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham started to tire, at last completing last. Secretariat proceeded with the quick pace and opened up a bigger and bigger edge on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34, over a second quicker than the following quickest Belmont mile portion ever, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had in the long run drained and completed third. Secretariat, be that as it may, did not waver. Turcotte stated, "This pony truly paced himself. He is savvy: I think he realized he was going miles, I never driven him." In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of nearly of a mile on the remainder of the field. Toward the completion, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the edge of-triumph record set by Triple Crown champ Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.
