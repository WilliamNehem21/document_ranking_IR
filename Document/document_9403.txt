Under such a course of action, Chenery sent two female horses to be reproduced to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She at that point sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing understanding expressed that the victor of the coin hurl would get first pick of the foals created in 1969, while the washout of the hurl would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a yearling and filly were created. In the 1969 rearing season, Cicada did not imagine, leaving just a single foal due in the spring of 1970. Accordingly, the champ of the coin hurl would get just a single foal (the primary pick from 1969), and the washout would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the main foal from 1970). Chenery later said that the two proprietors trusted they would lose the coin hurl, which was held in the fall of 1969 in the workplace of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, with Arthur "Bull" Hancock of Claiborne Farm as observer. Ogden Phipps won the hurl and removed the 1969 weanling filly from Somethingroyal. The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, however she did later turn into a stakes maker. Chenery got the Hasty Matelda yearling in 1969 and the so far unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, which ended up being Secretariat.
