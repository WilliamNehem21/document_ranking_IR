Ejler Jakobsson's residency started with a vast overabundance of stories that Pohl had procured, yet inside a year or two generous changes were obvious. In the mid 1970s, Jakobsson endeavored to refresh "World" picture, including a funny cartoon, "Sunpot", by Vaughn BodÃÂ©, for instance. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the normal book commentator in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not figure out how to give "System" another and particular character: "Sunpot" kept going just four issues, Sturgeon's surveys were undistinguished, and a considerable lot of the new creators he distributed have been, in the expressions of Mike Ashley, "benevolently obscure from that point forward". The paper quality and printing quality likewise dropped, and early spread structures were extremely frail. Jakobsson at first printed visitor publications as opposed to composing his own; when he assumed control over the article page his work was unremarkable. He figured out how to pull in a portion of the new scholars who were winding up surely understood in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ. Three books distributed in Jakobsson's "Universe" won honors: Isaac Asimov's "The Gods Themselves" and Arthur C. Clarke's "Meeting with Rama" each won both the Hugo and Nebula grants, in 1972 and 1973 separately, and Robert Silverberg's "A Time of Changes" won the Nebula in 1971. Sturgeon's short story "Moderate Sculpture" won both the Hugo and the Nebula in 1970.
