The species is stationary, implying that the feathered creatures don't normally leave Nauru. Banaba is the closest island, and in spite of being like Nauru, it comes up short on any larks. In any case, it is conceivable that populaces of the Nauru reed lark existed on different islands until relatively as of late. On the Marshall Islands, conventional stories allude to a little feathered creature, referred to differently as "annaÃÂ±", "anang" and "annÃÂ£ng". This winged creature was viewed as the property of chieftains. Despite the fact that no physical depictions exist of the species, it has been portrayed as butterfly-sized, charming smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands. Ethnographers KrÃÂ¤mer and Nevermann revealed that the winged animal wound up wiped out or extirpated around 1880. In light of depictions of winged creatures seen on Jaluit, Paul Schnee estimated that the "annaÃÂ±" may have been a Nauru reed lark. The termination of the "annaÃÂ±" may have been because of chasing by felines, which were acquainted with the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to chase rodents. They at that point duplicated before being spread by local people as pets, after which they began to end up non domesticated.
