In the lockout-abbreviated 2012Ã¢ÂÂ 13 NHL season, the two goaltenders split the playing obligations in spite of the fact that Schneider was the main goalie. Luongo dealt with his downgrade with class and stayed steady of Schneider, before long calling the Canucks "Cory's group." Head mentor Alain Vigneault said "Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why we got into playoffs. I have a great deal of confidence in him and that is for what reason we're running with him". In the opening playoff round confronting the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been harmed close to the finish of the customary season, Luongo began the initial two amusements and played well yet his group lost both. Luongo fell off the seat in amusement three after Schneider was pulled in the third time frame. Luongo was the reinforcement in diversion four as the Canucks lost in extra time, finishing his group's postseason in four straight recreations. Luongo put his penthouse available to be purchased, as it was acknowledged that he had played his last amusement as a Canuck. In spite of the fact that he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which spoke to a $5.33 million pay top hit, general administrator Mike Gillis stayed certain of making an arrangement in the late spring.
