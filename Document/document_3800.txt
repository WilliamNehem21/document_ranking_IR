Albert kept on dedicating himself to the instruction of his family and the administration of the regal family unit. His youngsters' tutor, Lady Lyttelton, thought him curiously kind and persistent, and portrayed him participating in family recreations with energy. He felt acutely the flight of his oldest little girl for Prussia when she wedded her life partner toward the start of 1858, and was disillusioned that his oldest child, the Prince of Wales, did not react well to the serious instructive program that Albert had intended for him. At seven years old, the Prince of Wales was required to take six hours of guidance, including an hour of German and an hour of French each day. At the point when the Prince of Wales fizzled at his exercises, Albert caned him. Whipping was basic at the time, and was not thought unduly unforgiving. Albert's biographer Roger Fulford composed that the connections between the relatives were "well disposed, loving and normalÃÂ ... there is no proof either in the Royal Archives or in the printed specialists to legitimize the conviction that the relations between the Prince and his oldest child were other than profoundly loving." Philip Magnus wrote in his life story of Albert's oldest child that Albert "endeavored to regard his youngsters as equivalents; and they had the capacity to enter his solidness and hold since they understood intuitively that he adored them as well as that he appreciated and required their conversation."
