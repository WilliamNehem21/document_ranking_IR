"Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" were given extensive modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure came in the fiscal year 1930. As part of the rebuilding, "Pennsylvania", which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, "Pennsylvania" and "Arizona" received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to Â°, new fire control systems on tripod masts were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled, eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns (four per side) were mounted on the weather deck which was above the secondary anti-ship 5-inch gun battery, and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated anti-aircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond anti-torpedo bulges, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: of armor were added to the second armored deck, and a torpedo bulkhead was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two "Pennsylvania"s received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled battleship . The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their old design speed of , even with the added bulk of bulges: "Pennsylvania" made 20.89Â knots and "Arizona" 20.7Â knots on full-power trials.
