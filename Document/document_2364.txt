In the mid-1990s, Knauf met a couple of Writers Guild TV scholars who urged him to reexamine "CarnivÃÂ le" as a TV arrangement. Knauf transformed the content's first demonstration into a pilot scene, in any case, having no contacts in the TV business, he was compelled to hold the task again and come back to his ordinary occupation. A couple of years after the fact, subsequent to understanding that his protection profession was not working out, he chose to give his screenwriting endeavors a last shot by offering the "CarnivÃÂ le" pilot on his site. The content was in this manner sent to Howard Klein by Scott Winant, a shared companion of the two men. After a few gatherings and discussions, Klein felt sure that "CarnivÃÂ le" would make a decent rambling TV arrangement that could keep going for a long time. Klein conveyed it to the consideration of Chris Albrecht and Carolyn Strauss of HBO, who were promptly open. The system esteemed Knauf excessively unpracticed in the TV business to give him full command over the financial plan, and designated Ronald D. Moore as showrunner. (Knauf supplanted Moore after one season when Moore left for the reconsidered "Battlestar Galactica".)
