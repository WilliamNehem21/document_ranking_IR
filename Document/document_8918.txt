Agnew's first marriage was to Beverley in 1983; it finished in separation in 1992, a year after he progressed toward becoming BBC cricket reporter. He has expounded on the job that cricket played in the breakdown of the relationship, contrasting his conditions and those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He likewise secured that his position meddled with his association with his youngsters: I had two youthful kids, matured seven and fiveÃÂ ... it was rapidly obvious that for me to have care of my little girls Ã¢ÂÂ or even to shape an association with them Ã¢ÂÂ was made unimaginable by my activity. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away for a considerable length of time at once every single winter?ÃÂ ... There was one event when I didn't perceive my oldest, Jennifer, when I came back from one tourÃÂ ... my kids keep on asking me for what valid reason I didn't leave and accept a position that would have kept me in the nation and enabled me to see them all the more regularly. I locate that one particularly difficult to reply." Agnew has along these lines remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current manager of BBC East Midlands Today, when they cooperated on BBC Radio Leicestershire.
