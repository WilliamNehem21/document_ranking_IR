"System Shock 2" has amassed a cult following, with fans asking for a sequel. On January 9, 2006, GameSpot reported that Electronic Arts had renewed its trademark protection on the "System Shock" name, leading to speculation that "System Shock 3" might be under development. Three days later, "Computer and Video Games" reported a reliable source had come forward and confirmed the title's production. Electronic Arts UK made no comment when confronted with the information. "PC Gamer UK" stated the team behind "" (EA Redwood Shores) was charged with its creation. Ken Levine, when asked whether he would helm the third installment, replied: "that question is completely out of my hands". He expressed optimism at the prospect of "System Shock 3", but revealed that EA had not shown interest in his own proposal for a sequel, and was not optimistic with regards to their abilities. Electronic Arts did not confirm a new title in the series and allowed the "System Shock" trademark registration to lapse. Redwood Shores' next release was 2008's "Dead Space", a game with noted similarities in theme and presentation to the "System Shock" series. According to "Dead Space" designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell, their project was originally intended to be "System Shock 3", before the release of "Resident Evil 4" inspired them to go back to the drawing board and develop it into something more along those lines, eventually becoming "Dead Space".
