The extension's portrayal as a building wonder and delightful sight attracted numerous guests to the Falls. Explorers could, while crossing the extension, appreciate a perspective on the Falls improved by the impression of remaining noticeable all around. The Falls, be that as it may, demonstrated inaccessible and indistinguishable to some when there was cloudy climate. In general, the Suspension Bridge was considered as a fascination that must be seen by guests to Niagara Falls. In artistic creations and prints of the extension, the Suspension Bridge turned into the center, pushing the Falls out of spotlight. Not at all like artistic creations of the Falls that catch the watcher's eye with their grand perspectives on the characteristic marvel, photos of the scaffold inspired watchers with the utilitarian plan of the structure. By 1897, the inbound trains to Niagara Falls brought 276,900 guests amid the long stretches of May to August. A streetcar framework was built up in 1882 to deal with the expanding cross-fringe person on foot traffic. At first pulled by ponies, the trolleys were changed over to keep running on power in 1892. The Suspension Bridge was the pride and image of the Great Western Railway, which touted it as the "main Route by means of Niagara Falls and Suspension Bridge".
