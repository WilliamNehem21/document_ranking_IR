These specialized confinements constrained Cerny to improve the general plans. Propelled by M. C. Escher, he planned dynamic scenes for the courses. By and large, Cerny halfway ascribed the plans to his restricted aesthetic aptitudes. He was an enthusiast of the 3D designs utilized in "Battlezone" and "I, Robot", yet felt that the visuals needed definition and needed to make a diversion with "strong and clean" 3D illustrations. Dissimilar to most other arcade rounds of the time, the course pictures were not drawn on the pixel level. Rather, Cerny characterized the rise of each point in the course and put away this data in a heightmap cluster. The course illustrations were then made by a beam following project that followed the way of light beams, utilizing the heightmap to decide the presence of the seminar on screen. This configuration likewise permitted Cerny to make shadows and utilize spatial enemy of associating, a strategy that gave the illustrations a smoother appearance. Cerny's course generator enabled him more opportunity to try different things with the dimension structures. When choosing what components to incorporate into a course, common sense was a major factor; components that would not work or would not show up as expected were discarded, for example, a flexible blockade or a seesaw scale. Different thoughts dropped from the plans were delicate glass bolsters, dark gap traps, and knocks and impediments incorporated with the course that pursued the marble.
