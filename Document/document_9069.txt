"C. porcellus" isn't found normally in the wild; it is likely slid from firmly related types of cavies, for example, "C. aperea", "C. fulgida", and "C. tschudii", which are still generally found in different districts of South America. Concentrates from 2007Ã¢ÂÂ 2010 connected sub-atomic markers and concentrated the skull and skeletal morphology of current and preserved creatures, in this way noteworthy the predecessor to in all probability be "Cavia tschudii". A few types of cavy distinguished in the twentieth century, for example, "C. anolaimae" and "C. guianae", might be household guinea pigs that have turned out to be non domesticated by reintroduction into nature. Wild cavies are found on lush fields and involve a natural specialty like that of cows. They are social, living in the wild in little gatherings that comprise of a few females (sows), a male (pig), and the youthful (which, in a break with the first porcine terminology, are designated "puppies" not "piglets"). They move together in gatherings (crowds) eating grass or other vegetation, and don't store nourishment. While they don't tunnel themselves or manufacture homes, they often look for safe house in the tunnels of different creatures, just as in cleft and passages shaped by vegetation. They will in general be most dynamic amid first light and nightfall (crepuscular), when it is more diligently for predators to spot them.
