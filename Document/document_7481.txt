The day after Trevor-Roper gave his assessment of credibility, Rupert Murdoch and his exchange group touched base in ZÃÂ¼rich. An arrangement was temporarily concurred for $2.5ÃÂ million for the US serialization rights, with an extra $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the exchanges among Murdoch and Sorge were occurring, the journals were inspected by Broyle and his "Newsweek" group. After extensive exchange Broyle was educated that the base value "Stern" would consider was $3ÃÂ million; the Americans returned home, advising Hensmann that they would get in touch with him by telephone in two days. At the point when Broyle reached the Germans he offered the sum, subject to verification by their picked master, Gerhard Weinberg. In 1952 Weinberg, a mindful and watchful student of history, had composed the "Manual for Captured German Documents", for use by the US military; the work is portrayed by Hamilton as authoritative in its extent of the subject. Weinberg ventured out to ZÃÂ¼rich and, as Trevor-Roper, was awed and consoled by the scope of things on show; he was likewise somewhat induced by Trevor-Roper's support of the journals' realness. Weinberg remarked that "the thought of anybody fashioning hundreds, even a huge number of pages of penmanship was difficult to credit".
