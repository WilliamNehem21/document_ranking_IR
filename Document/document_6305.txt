Expounding on Lee's style and utilization of cleverness in a grievous story, researcher Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: "LaughterÃÂ ... [exposes] the gangrene under the wonderful surface yet additionally by disparaging it; one can hardlyÃÂ ... be constrained by what one can chuckle at." Scout's intelligent perceptions about her neighbors and conduct motivated National Endowment of the Arts chief David Kipen to call her "insanely entertaining". To address complex issues, notwithstanding, Tavernier-Courbin takes note of that Lee uses spoof, parody, and incongruity viably by utilizing a youngster's point of view. After Dill guarantees to wed her, at that point invests an excessive amount of energy with Jem, Scout reasons the most ideal approach to get him to focus on her is to thump him, which she completes a few times. Scout's first day in school is a mocking treatment of instruction; her instructor says she should fix the harm Atticus has created in instructing her to peruse and compose, and denies Atticus from training her further. Lee treats the most unfunny circumstances with incongruity, in any case, as Jem and Scout attempt to see how Maycomb grasps prejudice and still attempts truly to remain a conventional society. Parody and incongruity are utilized to such a degree, that Tavernier-Courbin proposes one understanding for the book's title: Lee is doing the ridiculingÃ¢ÂÂof instruction, the equity framework, and her very own general publicÃ¢ÂÂby utilizing them as subjects of her entertaining objection.
