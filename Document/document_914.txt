DeForest Kelley returns as Leonard McCoy, specialist and the transporter of Spock's living soul. Kelley has most of the movie's critical scenes, yet admitted to incidental challenges in acting with and being coordinated by his long-term co-star. Notwithstanding, he has announced that he had no questions about Nimoy's capacity to coordinate the film. Reacting to proposals that "Star Trek" replicated "Star Wars", Kelley declared that the inverse was valid. Playing the other group individuals are James Doohan, as Montgomery Scott, the central architect; George Takei, as Hikaru Sulu, "Enterprise"s helmsman; Walter Koenig, as Pavel Chekov, route and acting science officer; and Nichelle Nichols, as Uhura, the ship's interchanges officer. Nichols had dependably demanded wearing a skirt; despite the fact that the standard female uniform utilized pants, the ensemble planner made an evaded form explicitly for her. Takei was frightened to hear that his character was designated "Small" by a gatekeeper at McCoy's phone amid the film, and contended with the film's maker to have the line cut. At the point when Takei saw the primary screening of the film, he altered his opinion and speedily apologized. He would later concede in his "" that "without that kill from [the guard], the scene [where Sulu in the long run pummels that equivalent guard] would not have played even half as nobly for Sulu."
