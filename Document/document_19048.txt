On 6 October 1955, Diá»m announced the referendum would be held on 23 October. The election was open to men and women aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters. The poll was contested by Báº£o Äáº¡i, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diá»m, who ran on a republican platform. According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem". In announcing the referendum, Diá»m portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Báº£o Äáº¡i. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Báº£o Äáº¡i, claiming he was motivated by these "legitimate and democratic" sentiments. Lansdale cautioned Diá»m against electoral fraud, confident that Diá»m would win a free election: "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I would know that it's rigged then." U.S. officials thought that a fair election would have seen Diá»m poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.
