As Kagame's second term advanced, he started to imply that he may look to revise as far as possible proviso of the Rwandan constitution, to enable him to keep running for a third term in the 2017 decisions. Prior in his administration he had discounted it, however in a 2014 discourse at Tufts University in the United States, Kagame said that he didn't have the foggiest idea when he would leave office, and that it was dependent upon the Rwandan individuals to choose. He told delegates "...let's watch out for what comes next as we go. Whatever will occur, we'll have a clarification." The next year a dissent happened outside parliament, and an appeal marked by 3.7 million individualsÃ¢ÂÂthe greater part of the electorateÃ¢ÂÂwas displayed to officials requesting Kagame to be permitted to remain in office. The parliament reacted by passing a change to the constitution in November 2015, with both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate casting a ballot consistently in support. The movement passed kept the two-term limit set up, and furthermore diminished the length of terms from 7 years to 5 years, however it made an express exemption for Kagame, who might be allowed to keep running for a third 7-year term pursued by two further 5-year terms, on the off chance that he so wanted. After the correction was passed in parliament, a choice was required for it to happen.
