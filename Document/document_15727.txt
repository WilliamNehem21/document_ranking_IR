Though the vertebral column of the trunk or torso is incompletely known, the back of "Brachiosaurus" most likely comprised twelve dorsal vertebrae; this can be inferred from the complete dorsal vertebral column preserved in an unnamed brachiosaurid specimen, BMNH R5937. Vertebrae of the front part of the dorsal column were slightly taller but much longer than those of the back part. This is in contrast to "Giraffatitan", where the vertebrae at the front part were much taller but only slightly longer. The centra (vertebral bodies), the lower part of the vertebrae, were more elongated and roughly circular in cross-section, while those of "Giraffatitan" were broader than tall. The foramina (small openings) on the sides of the centra, which allowed for the intrusion of air sacs, were larger than in "Giraffatitan". The diapophyses (large projections extending sideways from the neural arch of the vertebrae) were horizontal, while those of "Giraffatitan" were inclined upward. At their ends, these projections articulated with the ribs; the articular surface was not distinctly triangular as in "Giraffatitan". In side view, the upward-projecting neural spines stood vertically and were twice as wide at the base than at the top; those of "Giraffatitan" tilted backward and did not broaden at their base. When seen in front or back view, the neural spines widened toward their tops.
