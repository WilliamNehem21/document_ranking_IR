In 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his better half Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. In spite of the fact that John furnished them with emphatically Christian instruction and a faith in the mediocrity of ladies, the two of which she would dismiss, he stirred Murray's enthusiasm for prehistoric studies through taking her to see nearby landmarks. In 1873, the young ladies' mom touched base in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both ended up conversant in German. In 1875 they came back to Calcutta, remaining there till 1877. They at that point moved with their folks back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, South London. There, they invested much energy visiting The Crystal Palace, while their dad worked at his association's London office. In 1880, they came back to Calcutta, where Margaret stayed for the following seven years. She turned into an attendant at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was controlled by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was included with the medical clinic's endeavors to manage a cholera flare-up. In 1887, she came back to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John had moved, presently bereaved. Here she took up work as a social laborer managing nearby underprivileged individuals. At the point when her dad resigned and moved to England, she moved into his home in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his passing in 1891. In 1893 she at that point headed out to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where her sister had moved to with her new spouse.
