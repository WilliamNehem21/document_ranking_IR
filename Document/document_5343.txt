In 2000 and 2006, scientistss driven by OctÃÂ¡vio Mateus depicted a find from the LourinhÃÂ£ Formation in focal west Portugal (ML 352) as another example of "Ceratosaurus", comprising of a correct femur (upper thigh bone), a left tibia (shin bone), and a few disconnected teeth recouped from the bluffs of ValmitÃÂ£o shoreline, between the districts LourinhÃÂ£ and Torres Vedras. The bones were discovered implanted in yellow to dark colored, fine-grained sandstones, which were stored by waterways as floodplain stores and have a place with the lower dimensions of the Porto Novo Member, which is believed to be late Kimmeridgian in age. Extra bones of this individual (SHN(JJS)- 65), including a left femur, a correct tibia, and a halfway left fibula (calf bone), were since presented due to advancing bluff disintegration. Albeit at first piece of a private accumulation, these extra components turned out to be formally curated after the private gathering was given to the Sociedade de HistÃÂ³ria Natural in Torres Vedras, and were depicted in detail in 2015. The example was attributed to the species "Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus" by Mateus and associates in 2006. A 2008 survey via Carrano and Sampson affirmed the task to "Ceratosaurus", yet inferred that the task to a particular animal groups is beyond the realm of imagination at present. In 2015, Elisabete Malafaia and associates, who scrutinized the legitimacy of "C. dentisulcatus", appointed the example to "Ceratosaurus" aff. "Ceratosaurus nasicornis".
