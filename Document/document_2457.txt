Bede, in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", says of Penda that he was "a most warlike man of the imperial race of the Mercians" and that, following Edwin of Northumbria's thrashing in 633 ("see" underneath), he managed the Mercians for a long time with differing fortune. The prominent twentieth century student of history Frank Stenton was of the feeling that the language utilized by Bede "leaves most likely that ... Penda, however dropped from the imperial group of the Mercians, just turned into their ruler after Edwin's thrashing". The "Historia Brittonum" concurs Penda a rule of just ten years, maybe dating it from the season of the Battle of Maserfield ("see" beneath) around 642, albeit as indicated by the for the most part acknowledged order this would in any case be over ten years. Given the clear issues with the dates given by the "Annal" and the "Historia", Bede's record of the length of Penda's rule is commonly considered the most conceivable by students of history. Nicholas Brooks noticed that, since these three records of the length of Penda's rule originate from three unique sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may only mirror the occasions at which their individual people groups initially had military inclusion with Penda.
