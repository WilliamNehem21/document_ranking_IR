Roderick Farey, in his historical articles on Pistrucci, portrayed him as "an Italian with a blazing mien, he had various contentions with the specialists yet nobody could question his virtuoso initially as an appearance shaper and later as an etcher and medallist." Those debate, and an apparent gradualness to finish his works (particularly the Waterloo Medal) have been wellsprings of the analysis by later journalists. Howard Linecar, in his book on British coin plans and originators, expressed, "there is little uncertainty that Pistrucci held the cutting of these bites the dust as a bartering counter in his tenacious endeavors to get the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal MintÃÂ ... On equalization it is maybe reasonable for state that Pistrucci, having likely been guaranteed what he couldn't haveÃÂ ... crushed the last drop of blood out of the circumstance." According to Clancy, "With extraordinary ability can regularly come discussion and all through his profession Pistrucci was acclaimed and criticized in equivalent measure, keeping up a progression of tense associations with his partners, the most pointed of which [was] with his kindred etcher William Wyon." Craig finished up, "Aside from the George and Dragon structure, which was less regarded then than nowÃÂ ... this present craftsman's Mint works, in contrast to his private bonuses, were disappointments".
