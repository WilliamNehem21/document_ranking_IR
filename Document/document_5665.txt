Inside, the ground floor of the west wing housed the lounge area, administration regions and drove through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The administration region was fitted with a mezzanine floor to give resting offices to male hirelings; the dozing quarters for female workers were on the top floor of the chateau to keep the two genders a decent separation far from one another. On a similar dimension, the east wing had an investigation with bet room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two illustration rooms and a pool room. An extensive library, partitioned into areas by columns, was between the boudoir and study, alongside the substantial cove window. The primary floor, got to by means of the fundamental staircase situated inside the passageway lobby, had all the family rooms, and included galleries. Hip showers were conveyed to the rooms each night as no washrooms were fused. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where most of the manor's goods and fittings were made from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor adjacent to the female hireling convenience. Around thirty rooms made up the cellar, among them a smoking room where versions of "Punch" and "The Illustrated London News" were provided as perusing material. The rest of the rooms on the storm cellar level were workshops, wine basements and individual parlors for the head servant, maid and other chief hirelings, together with general storerooms.
