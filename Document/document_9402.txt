The soonest foes of the Parthians were the Seleucids in the west and the Scythians in the east. Be that as it may, as Parthia extended westbound, they collided with the Kingdom of Armenia, and in the end the late Roman Republic. Rome and Parthia rivaled each other to set up the rulers of Armenia as their subordinate customers. The Parthians soundly vanquished Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae in 53ÃÂ BC, and in 40Ã¢ÂÂ 39ÃÂ BC, Parthian powers caught the entire of the Levant with the exception of Tire from the Romans. Be that as it may, Mark Antony drove a counterattack against Parthia, despite the fact that his victories were by and large accomplished in his nonattendance, under the administration of his lieutenant Ventidius. Different Roman sovereigns or their selected officers attacked Mesopotamia over the span of the following Roman-Parthian Wars of the following couple of hundreds of years. The Romans caught the urban areas of Seleucia and Ctesiphon on numerous events amid these contentions, yet were never ready to clutch them. Visit common wars between Parthian contenders to the position of royalty demonstrated more risky to the Empire's solidness than remote attack, and Parthian power dissipated when Ardashir I, leader of Istakhr in Persis, rebelled against the Arsacids and slaughtered their last ruler, Artabanus V, in 224ÃÂ AD. Ardashir built up the Sassanid Empire, which ruled Iran and a great part of the Near East until the Muslim victories of the seventh century AD, despite the fact that the Arsacid line lived on through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia, the Arsacid line of Iberia, and the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania; every eponymous part of the Parthian Arsacids.
