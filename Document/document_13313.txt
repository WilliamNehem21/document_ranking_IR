A two-level shelter was worked under the flight deck, each dimension being high. The lower overhang was long by wide and the upper was . Every shelter could be separated off by electrically worked steel shades on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to debilitate either out of gratings at the back of the flight deck, or, when landing tasks were in advancement, out of the side of the lower shed at the back of the ship. This arrangement ended up being exceptionally inadmissible as it devoured important space, made pieces of the lower shelter horrendous and meddled with landing tasks to a more noteworthy or lesser degree. Her unique taking off deck stayed set up for use by little flying machine like warriors with the goal that the ship could at the same time land airplane on the principle flight deck while contenders were taking off on the lower deck and could expediently dispatch her air ship from the two decks. Entryways at the forward end of the upper shelter opened onto the lower flying deck. Two (lifts) were introduced to exchange flying machine between the flight deck and shelters. Two prepared use petroleum tanks were accommodated flying machine and the ship's vessels on the upper deck. An extra of oil were in mass stockpiling. The longitudinal capturing gear demonstrated disliked in administration and it was requested expelled in 1927 after tests on board "Enraged" in 1926 had demonstrated that deck-edge palisades were viable in lessening cross-deck blasts that could blow air ship over the side. "Furious"s long fumes ducting hampered landing tasks, and limited the measure of the overhangs and hence the quantity of air ship that she could convey.
