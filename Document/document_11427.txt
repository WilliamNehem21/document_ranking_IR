Toward the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, "Asahi", told by Captain Hikohachi Yamada, was doled out to the first Division of the first Fleet. She took an interest in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral TÃÂgÃÂ HeihachirÃÂ drove the first Fleet in an assault on the Russian boats of the Pacific Squadron moored simply outside Port Arthur. TÃÂgÃÂ had expected the unexpected night assault by his destroyers to be considerably more effective than it was, envisioning that the Russians would be severely complicated and debilitated, however they had recuperated from their amazement and were prepared for his assault. The Japanese boats were spotted by the secured cruiser , which was watching seaward and cautioned the Russian barriers. TÃÂgÃÂ assaulted the Russian beach front guards with his primary weapon and connect with the boats with his optional firearms. Part his shoot ended up being a poor choice as the Japanese and six-inch weapons delivered little harm on the Russian boats, which focused all their discharge on the Japanese boats with some impact. Albeit numerous boats on the two sides were hit, Russian setbacks numbered just 17, while the Japanese endured 60 slaughtered and injured before TÃÂgÃÂ withdrew. "Asahi" was not hit amid the commitment.
