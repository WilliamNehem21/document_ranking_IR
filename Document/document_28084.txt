Hartman's first starring film role came in 1995's "Houseguest", alongside Sinbad. Other films included "Greedy", "Coneheads", "Sgt. Bilko", "So I Married an Axe Murderer", "CB4", "Jingle All the Way", "Kiki's Delivery Service", and "Small Soldiers", the last of which was his final theatrically released film. At the same time, he preferred working on television. His other television roles included appearances on episodes of "The John Larroquette Show", "The Dana Carvey Show", and the HBO TV film "The Second Civil War" as the President of the United States. He appeared as the kidnapper Randy in the third season cliffhanger finale of "3rd Rock from the Sun" â a role reportedly written especially for him, but he died before filming of the concluding episode could take place. Executive producer Terry Turner decided to recast the part, reshoot and air the finale again, noting: "I have far too much respect for [Hartman] to try to find some clever way of getting around this real tragedy." Hartman made a considerable amount of money from television advertising, earning $300,000 for a series of four commercials for the soft drink Slice. He also appeared in advertisements for McDonald's (as Hugh McAttack) and 1-800-Collect (as Max Jerome).
