Amid the 1750s "Savior" was performed progressively at celebrations and basilicas all through the nation. Individual melodies and arias were every so often separated for use as songs of devotion or motets in community gatherings, or as show pieces, a training that developed in the nineteenth century and has proceeded from that point onward. After Handel's passing, exhibitions were given in Florence (1768), New York (extracts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart originally heard it. For the exhibitions in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his passing, the melodic powers utilized in the Foundling Hospital execution of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be run of the mill. A design for vast scale exhibitions started in 1784, in a progression of dedicatory shows of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the support of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey divider records that "The Band comprising of DXXV [525] vocal and instrumental entertainers was directed by Joah Bates Esqr." In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, an advocate of expansive scale exhibitions, expressed, "Mr BatesÃÂ ... had realized Handel well and regarded his desires. The symphony utilized was two hundred and fifty in number, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three sets of timpani (some made particularly substantial)." In 1787 further exhibitions were given at the Abbey; ads guaranteed, "The Band will comprise of Eight Hundred Performers".
