Eumenes II came to Rome in 172 BC and conveyed a discourse to the Senate reprimanding the supposed wrongdoings and transgressions of Perseus. This persuaded the Roman Senate to announce the Third Macedonian War (171Ã¢ÂÂ 168BC). Despite the fact that Perseus' powers were successful against the Romans at the Battle of Callinicus in 171BC, the Macedonian armed force was crushed at the Battle of Pydna in June 168BC. Perseus fled to Samothrace yet surrendered without further ado thereafter, was conveyed to Rome for the triumph of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, and was set under house capture at Alba Fucens, where he kicked the bucket in 166BC. The Romans canceled the Macedonian government by introducing four separate associated republics in its stead, their capitals situated at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. The Romans forced serious laws hindering numerous social and monetary collaborations between the occupants of these republics, including the restricting of relational unions among them and the (brief) denial on gold and silver mining. A certain Andriscus, guaranteeing Antigonid plummet, opposed the Romans and was articulated ruler of Macedonia, vanquishing the military of the Roman praetor Publius Juventius Thalna amid the Fourth Macedonian War (150Ã¢ÂÂ 148BC). In spite of this, Andriscus was crushed in 148BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose powers involved the kingdom. This was followed in 146BC by the Roman devastation of Carthage and triumph over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, introducing the time of Roman Greece and the continuous foundation of the Roman area of Macedonia.
