For neighborhood enterprises along the course of the proposed trench, whose activities depended on water from nearby waterways and creeks which the channel may likewise utilize, its development was a disputable thought. At a gathering in Bolton on 4ÃÂ October 1790, it was settled that "legitimate provisions be embedded in the bill to avert damage to proprietors of plants". A gathering in Bury at the Eagle and Child open house on 29ÃÂ September 1790 verified an understanding that "the utility of this plan by and by can't with legitimacy be discovered until such time as it has been confirmed, from whence and in what extent the owners of the proposed route hope to draw their assets of water". At another gathering in Bury, on 13ÃÂ October 1790, Hugh Henshall gave a composed report on the channel, and expressed that his arrangement would not require water from the stream in the midst of dry spell, yet that floods and rivulets would supply his supplies. He recommended that factory proprietors could be secured by a reasonable provision in the bill, and such a proviso was appropriately gotten by Robert Peel. Organizations in Bolton were worried about the area of the trench end, and proposed the development of a passage to enable the end to be manufactured nearer to the town focus. Ralph Fletcher, representative for those concerned, wrote about this proposition to the board of trustees, albeit no passage was constructed.
