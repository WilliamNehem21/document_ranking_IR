In the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), FÃÂ¼rstenberg directed the second section of the Austrian power, which included nine contingents of infantry and 30 squadrons of rangers; with these, he overpowered the power of General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his situation to keep the French power from withdrawing north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, connected with the primary Austrian power at Kehl, Archduke Charles endowed to Lieutenant Field Marshal FÃÂ¼rstenberg the order of the powers blockading HÃÂ¼ningen, which included two divisions with 20 units of infantry and 40 squadrons of rangers. Charles' trust in his young field marshal was all around put. On 27 November, FÃÂ¼rstenberg's central specialist opened and depleted the water-filled channel securing the French fortresses. FÃÂ¼rstenberg offered the officer of the bridgehead, General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the chance to surrender, which he declined. In the evening of 30 November to 1 December, FÃÂ¼rstenberg's power raged the bridgehead twice, however was twice repelled. In one of these assaults, the French authority was mortally injured and kicked the bucket on 3 December. FÃÂ¼rstenberg kept up the Siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles connected with the more grounded French power toward the north of Kehl.
