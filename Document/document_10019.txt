After the demise of his companion Bishop Enguerrand, Jocelin was raised to the parish of Glasgow. He was chosen on 23 May 1174. The decision, in the same way as other Scottish episcopal races of the period, was done within the sight of the lord, William the Lion, at Perth, close Scone, the central living arrangement of Scotland's rulers. The race was most likely done by "compromissarii", implying that the general part of the parish of Glasgow had chosen a little gathering to which they designated the intensity of decision. Pope Alexander III was later informed that Jocelin was chosen by the dignitary and section of the see. The "Annal of Melrose" states that he was chosen "by interest of the ministry, and of the general population; and with the assent of the ruler himself", maybe demonstrating that the choice had just been made by the Glasgow pastorate before the formal decision at Perth. The decision was surely an accomplishment. Cistercian diocesans were uncommon in Great Britain, and Jocelin was just the second Cistercian to rise a Scottish ministerial office. Jocelin was required to go to France to acquire authorization from the General Chapter of the Cistercian request at CÃÂ®teaux to leave the abbacy. Pope Alexander III had officially authorized his sanctification, and gave consent for the sanctification to happen without compelling Jocelin to venture out to Rome. Helpfully, it was at Cistercian place of Clairvaux that, at some point before 15 March 1175, Jocelin was blessed by the Papal legate Eskil, Archbishop of Lund and Primate of Denmark. Jocelin had come back to the Kingdom of Scotland by 10 April, and it is realized that on 23 May he had sanctified a priest named Laurence as his successor at Melrose.
