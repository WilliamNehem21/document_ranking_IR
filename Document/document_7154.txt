Bradford Wright portrayed "Gatekeepers" as "Moore's eulogy for the idea of legends when all is said in done and superheroes specifically." Putting the story in a contemporary sociological setting, Wright composed that the characters of "Guardians" were Moore's "reprimand to the individuals who confided in 'saints' and pioneers to watch the world's destiny". He added that to put confidence in such symbols was to surrender moral obligation to "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Gatekeepers' of the world who expected to 'salvage' us and maybe ruin to the planet all the while". Moore explicitly expressed in 1986 that he was stating "Guardians" to be "not against Americanism, [but] hostile to Reaganism", explicitly trusting that "right now a specific piece of Reagan's America isn't terrified. They believe they're resistant." Before the arrangement debuted, Gibbons expressed: "There's no unmistakable political message by any stretch of the imagination. It's a dream extrapolation of what may occur and if individuals can see things in it that apply to the genuine America, at that point they're understanding it into the comic [...]." While Moore needed to expound on "control legislative issues" and the "stressing" times he lived in, he expressed the reason that the story was set in a substitute the truth was on the grounds that he was concerned that perusers would "turn off" on the off chance that he assaulted a pioneer they appreciated. Moore expressed in 1986 that he "was intentionally endeavoring to accomplish something that would make individuals feel uneasy."
