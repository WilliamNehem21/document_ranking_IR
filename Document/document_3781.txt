In 1907, Sifton was one individual from a three-part commission alloted to research work turmoil between coal diggers and mine administrators. His associates were mining official Lewis Stockett and diggers' association official William Haysom. Excavators' requests included expanded wages, a decrease in working hours to eight every day (from ten), the posting of mine assessment reports, the confined stockpiling of explosives, the utilization of non-solidifying explosives, and semi-month to month as opposed to regularly scheduled pay. The mine administrators protested this keep going point on the premise that numerous excavators did not answer to work the day after payday, and it was along these lines attractive to keep paydays to a base. The commission suggested that youngsters under sixteen ought not be permitted to work in mines, that overseers should post their reports, that mine locales ought to have shower houses, and that ventilation investigation ought to be improved. It likewise suggested that Albertans keep a supply of coal close by amid the late spring for winter use. The commission was quiet on wages (but to state that these ought not be fixed by enactment), the task of organization stores (a sore point among the diggers), and the consolidation of mine associations (which was prescribed by mines yet restricted by the associations). It made no proposal about working hours, yet Premier Alexander Rutherford's administration enacted an eight-hour day in any case.
