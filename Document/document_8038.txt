Mrs. Artisan's amalgam of stories and encouraging trips commands the content; despite the fact that the content accentuates the young ladies' ethical advancement, the peruser finds out almost no about the young ladies themselves. The work comprises to a great extent of individual accounts of individuals known to Mrs. Artisan and of good stories for the enlightenment of Mary and Caroline and the peruser. For instance, "The History of Charles Townley" outlines the deadly outcomes of tarrying. Mrs. Artisan takes the young ladies to Charles Townley's demolished chateau to disclose to them the useful example of a "kid of phenomenal capacities, and solid sentiments"; shockingly, "he at any point allowed those sentiments to coordinate his lead, without submitting to the course of reason; I mean, the present feeling represented him ... He in every case to be sure expected to act directly in each specific "to-morrow"; yet "to-day" he pursued the predominant impulse" (accentuation Wollstonecraft's). Charles needs to help those in need, yet he is effectively diverted by books and plays. He in the end loses the majority of his cash however his one residual companion causes him recover his fortune in India. However notwithstanding when this companion needs help, Charles can't act rapidly enough and, appallingly, his companion is detained and passes on and his companion's little girl is compelled to wed a rake. At the point when Charles comes back to England, he is overwhelmed with blame. He safeguards the little girl from her troubled marriage, yet both she and he have gone marginally crazy before the finish of the story, she from her marriage and he from blame.
