On returning to the infantry job, the tenth Battalion was doled out to the 72nd Brigade in the 36th Infantry Division. The division was bound for Burma, and therefore the regiment "having been prepared as infantry, tank troops, and joined activities troops, went straight into wilderness fighting, for which we had no preparation". The Glosters landed on the Arakan Peninsula (present day Rakhine) in February 1944, were a piece of the aid project in the Battle of the Admin Box, and battled in scattered, organization scale activities in the catch of the Mayu passages and Hambone Hill. The division went into save in May and was carried to Myitkyina in July, exchanging toward the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) under the American General Joseph Stilwell. It pushed south along the Mandalay railroad and caught Taungni on 9ÃÂ August, amid which period the tenth Battalion lost a bigger number of men to disorder than foe activity. Conveyed back up to quality in September, the force was occupied with four days of savage battling at Pinwe in November, losing every one of the officers in both An and C Companies, and everything except one in B Company, before being alleviated on 26ÃÂ November.
