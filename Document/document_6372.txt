Rainey presented enactment for an Alabama Centennial half dollar in the House of Representatives on February 28, 1920, with the bill assigned as H.R. 12824. It was alluded to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the administrator. That board of trustees held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, just as on the coinage recommendation that would turn into the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar, with the Alabama coin the principal request of business. Congressman Rainey, in his bill, had requested 100,000 quarter dollars, and keeping in mind that tending to the advisory group expressed that the sole analysis of his coinage proposition in the Alabama press was one article recommending he ought to have requested twofold the sum. The decision of group came as an amazement to board of trustees part William A. Ashbrook of Ohio, a mint piece authority, who inquired as to why Rainey was not requesting half dollars, as different states had. Rainey was amiable to that, and furthermore acknowledged Ashbrook's demoralization when the Alabaman needed to twofold the approved number of coins. The panel casted a ballot to suggest Rainey's bill, with a change to accommodate half dollars rather than quarters, and afterward continued to think about the Pilgrim proposition. Vestal had two days recently kept in touch with Treasury Secretary David F. Houston about the Pilgrim coin, and Houston reacted that while his area of expertise had not restricted the Maine Centennial (recently endorsed by the council) or Alabama coinage charges, the Treasury had worries that issuing extensive quantities of various structures would help fraudsters. Vestal issued a report for his advisory group on March 27, 1920, demonstrating his board of trustees' help for the Alabama bill once altered, and connecting the note from Secretary Houston.
