In , Square reused the "Seiken Densetsu" trademark for an unrelated Game Boy action role-playing game directed by Koichi Ishii. Originally developed under the title "Gemma Knights", the game was renamed "Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden" (published in North America as "Final Fantasy Adventure" and in Europe as "Mystic Quest"). Beginning with the sequel, "Secret of Mana", "Seiken Densetsu" was subsequently "spun off" into its own series of action role-playing games distinct from "Final Fantasy", named the "Mana" series outside Japan. Four titles in the series were released between 1993 and 2003. "Secret of Mana" was originally intended to be a launch title for the Super NES CD-ROM Adapter, but when the add-on was cancelled it was cut down into a standard Super NES cartridge, with many of the cut ideas appearing in other Square titles. It was followed in 1995 by the Japan-only "Seiken Densetsu 3"; the game was originally planned to be released in English as "Secret of Mana 2", but technical issues and localization costs prohibited the release. The final new game in the series' initial run is the 1999 "Legend of Mana", developed for the PlayStation. "Legend" is a 2D game like its predecessors, despite the PlayStation's 3D focus, because the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. 2003 saw the release of "Sword of Mana", a remake of the original "Seiken Densetsu" for the Game Boy Advance. The remake was outsourced to Brownie Brown, which was composed of many of the Square employees who had worked on "Legend".
