Crane's later books have not gotten as much basic recognition. After the achievement of "The Red Badge of Courage", Crane composed another story set in the Bowery. "George's Mother" is not so much figurative but rather more close to home than his two past books, and it centers around the contention between a congregation going, balance following lady (thought to be founded on Crane's mom) and her single outstanding posterity, who is a guileless visionary. Basic reaction to the novel was blended. "The Third Violet", a sentiment that he composed rapidly subsequent to distributing "The Red Badge of Courage", is regularly considered as Crane's endeavor to speak to prevalent gatherings of people. Crane thought of it as a "tranquil little story." Although it contained self-portraying subtleties, the characters have been regarded inauthentic and clichÃÂ©. Crane's underdog to last novel, "Dynamic Service", rotates around the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, with which the creator was recognizable. Albeit noted for its mocking interpretation of the exaggerated and exceptionally energetic works that were prominent of the nineteenth century, the novel was not effective. It is commonly acknowledged by commentators that Crane's work endured now because of the speed which he wrote so as to meet his high costs. His last novel, a dramatic and picaresque work entitled "The O'Ruddy", was done after death by Robert Barr and distributed in 1903.
