Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. About 70â90% of ingested fluoride is absorbed into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80â90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest excreted, mostly via urine; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride. In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is the main source of fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities. Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing coal or from phosphate fertilizers; trona, used to tenderize meat in Tanzania; and tea leaves, particularly the tea bricks favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has established Dietary Reference Intakes for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01Â mg/day for infants aged 6Â months or less, to 4Â mg/day for men aged 19Â years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10Â mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8Â years, and 10Â mg/day thereafter. A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6Â mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2Â mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world's regions: for example, in Sichuan, China the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1Â mg/day in drinking water but 8.9Â mg/day in food and 0.7Â mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.
