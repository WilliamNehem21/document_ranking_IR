Cuban President RaÃÂºl Castro, sibling of previous Cuban president Fidel Castro, proclaimed that "[Obama] resembles a decent man, I trust he is fortunate", while Ricardo AlarcÃÂ³n, leader of the Cuban assembly, conceded in his remarks about Obama that "the approaching [U.S.] president 'is an unavoidable issue mark.'" Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki communicated trust in receptiveness for another course, taking note of that "if Obama picks the correct way, repays the past, lifts antagonistic vibe and U.S.ÃÂ hegemony, and reconsiders the past political errors, we will have no threatening vibe." State-claimed Channel One Russia, Russia's lead early nightly news appear, secured Obama's presidential introduction as a minor news story, giving a significant part of the day's broadcast appointment rather to the gas war with Ukraine. The People's Republic of China secured the Obama initiation live on its stateÃ¢ÂÂcontrolled China Central Television, furnishing synchronous interpretation into Mandarin Chinese with a concise deferral to permit editing of Obama's remarks. At the point when President Obama referenced "before ages looked down one party rule and socialism", Chinese state TV authorities remove unexpectedly from the broadcast discourse and changed to a talk in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and TV media in North Korea gave no inclusion or notice of the Obama initiation in the hours after the occasion, selecting rather to cover news about Equatorial Guinea respecting the North Korean envoy.
