Allward picked a generally new development strategy for the landmark: limestone attached to a cast solid edge. An establishment bed of 11,000 tons of concrete, fortified with many huge amounts of steel, filled in as the help bed for the remembrance. The dedication base and twin arches contained right around 6,000 tons of Seget limestone. Artists cut the 20 around twofold life-sized human figures nearby from huge squares of stone. The carvers utilized half-measure mortar models delivered by Allward in his studio, presently in plain view at the Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to repeat the figures at the best possible scale. The carvers led their work all year inside brief studios worked around each figure. The consideration of the names of those executed in France with no realized grave was not part of the first plan, and Allward was troubled when the legislature requested that he incorporate them. Allward contended that the incorporation of names was not part of the first charging. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward demonstrated his expectation to consign the names of the missing to asphalt stones around the landmark. The aggregate dishearten and hullabaloo of the commission constrained Allward to yield and fuse the names of the missing on the dedication dividers. The errand of writing the names did not start until the mid 1930s and utilized a typeface that Allward intended for the landmark.
