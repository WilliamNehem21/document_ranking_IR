Albeit both were subpoenaed as observers neither Fortune nor Judith Natus were called to the stand, the lawyer capable later clarifying that the crowd outside may have threatened a few observers. Susannah Wells' neighbors were dismissed by the crowd and her girl and relative were immediately perceived and halted. Be that as it may, three observers found in Dorset by George Squires, to affirm for his mom, gone by unrecognized. The primary, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his home in Abbotsbury "with hankies, gardens, muslins, and checks, to sell about town" from 1Ã¢ÂÂ 9ÃÂ January. This was verified by his neighbor, William Clarke. Squires' last observer, Thomas Greville, guaranteed that he had obliged Mary and "her sister and her sibling" under his rooftop in Coombe, on 14ÃÂ January, where they sold "cloths, gardens, and such things". This was negated by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. Insier guaranteed he realized Squires by sight and that in the three weeks before her capture he had seen her telling fortunes in the area of Wells' home. Wells, whose witnesses had been unfit to go by the horde outside, had the capacity to offer just two sentences with all due respect. She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1ÃÂ February, and that "as to Squires, I never observed her over a week and multi day before we were taken up." According to a contemporary report in the "London Daily Advertiser", as the three observers left the court the horde, holding up in the yard, "beat them, kicked them moved them in the Kennel and generally abused them before they experienced them to get them".
