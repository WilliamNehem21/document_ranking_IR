Frustrated at being pigeonholed as the "snide enthusiasm of the person", Stone co-featured with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period dramatization "The Help" (2011), a film she observed to challenge. The film depends on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of a similar name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a craving to work in the film. Taylor has stated: "Emma was totally ungainly and dorky, with her rough voice, and she sat down and we got somewhat inebriated and had an awesome time, and I just idea, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." She was given a role as Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, a hopeful author finding out about the lives of the African-American house cleaners. In anticipation of the part, she prepared to talk in a Southern tongue; she additionally instructed herself on the Civil Rights Movement through writing and film. With an overall gross of $216 million against a financial plan of $25 million, "The Help" turned into Stone's most economically fruitful film to that point. The film, and her execution, got positive audits from pundits. Composing for "Realm", Anna Smith imagined that Stone was "good natured and gigantically affable" in spite of discovering imperfections in the character. The film was selected for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.
