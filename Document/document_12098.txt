As the issue included the sovereign, Stacey counseled different officers in the regiment about what ought to be done, and found that sentiment was isolated between permitting Gordon-Cumming to stay in the regiment while he safeguarded himself, or expelling him straight away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the sovereign's more youthful sibling, the Duke of Connaught, was additionally asked: as per Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke "demanded that Gordon-Cumming must be pounded". Stacey dissented, and believed that the entire story should have been brought out before such a choice was taken. He revealed the circumstance to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and mentioned authorization to let Gordon-Cumming resign on half-pay. Buller consented to the solicitation, yet expressed that if Gordon-Cumming's lawful activity fizzled, the authorization would be explored. Stacey transferred the message to Gordon-Cumming and revealed to him that marking the note was a mistake: "Since you marked that archive you will never put on a sword in the regiment. On the off chance that you bring an effective activity you will be permitted to resign: on the off chance that you come up short, you will be rejected [from] the administration". The Duke of Connaught firmly disliked Buller's choice, and he pulled back to Portsmouth, declining to again be drawn on the undertaking, even after his sibling mentioned further counsel.
