Toward the beginning of September 1917, after the German triumph of the Russian port of Riga, the German naval force chose to kill the Russian maritime powers that still held the Gulf of Riga. The "Admiralstab" (the Navy High Command) arranged an activity to catch the Baltic island of ÃÂsel, and explicitly the Russian firearm batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the request was issued for a joint activity with the military to catch ÃÂsel and Moon Islands; the essential maritime segment was to include the lead, "Moltke", alongside the III and IVÃÂ Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Alongside nine light cruisers, three torpedo watercraft flotillas, and many mine fighting boats, the whole power numbered about 300 boats, bolstered by more than 100 flying machine and six blimp. The attack drive added up to roughly 24,600 officers and enrolled men. At this point, the IV Battle Squadron had gone under the direction of Vice Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. Contradicting the Germans were the old Russian pre-battleships and , the heavily clad cruisers , and , 26 destroyers, and a few torpedo water crafts and gunboats. The army on ÃÂsel numbered somewhere in the range of 14,000 men.
