The British Army and Royal Navy, in participation with the Loyalist components of the pioneer government under Governor Josiah Martin, arranged an attack of North Carolina close Wilmington, a thriving and deliberately found seaport in the Cape Fear locale. The Highlander units at Cross Creek were coordinated to cooperate with British Army units, which General Thomas Gage proposed to arrive in North Carolina. Moore drove his order upriver along the south bank of the Cape Fear and sustained a stream crossing at Rockfish Creek, which would have been the Loyalists' most immediate way to Wilmington. At this site, Moore kept on social affair fortifications, in the long run directing roughly 1,100 men. Brigadier General Donald MacDonald, who told the civilian army of roughly 1,500 Highlanders, sent an agent to Moore, requesting that he join the Loyalist cause or be looked with an assault. Moore, deferring in his answer to purchase time, in the long run declined that request, basically challenging MacDonald's false front. MacDonald, whose men did not have the confidence for a prompt showdown, got word that Caswell's volunteer army had been requested to unite with Moore. Detecting that time was of the pith, MacDonald pulled back, and drove the Loyalist unforeseen far from Moore toward an intersection further downriver.
