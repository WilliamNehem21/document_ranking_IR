After completing "The War of the End of the World", Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished "The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta" ("Historia de Mayta", 1984). The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on May 29, 1962 in the Andean city of Jauja. Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando BelaÃºnde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay. The Commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public. Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair. In 1986, he completed his next novel, "Who Killed Palomino Molero" ("Â¿QuiÃ©n matÃ³ a Palomino Molero?"), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation. Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a "literary exorcism" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission. The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, "Death in the Andes" ("Lituma en los Andes"), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.
