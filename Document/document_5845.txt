Fossils that may have had a place with the holotype were found by the American geologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge in 1871, yet have presumably been lost since. Extra plesiosaur fossils were recouped close to the first area in 1954, 1991, 1994, and 1998, including back vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (midsection ribs), and gastroliths (stomach stones). As none of these components cover with those of the holotype example, in 2005 the American scientist Michael J. Everhart finished up they had a place with a similar individual, and that the parts had been isolated before entombment of the remains. He additionally noticed that a little stone wedged in the neural waterway of one of the tail vertebrae of the holotype might be a gastrolith, in light of its cleaned appearance. In 2007 Leslie NoÃÂ¨ and Marcela GÃÂ³mez-PÃÂ©rez communicated question that the extra components had a place with the sort example, or even to "Elasmosaurus", because of absence of proof. They clarified that components missing from the holotype may have been lost to enduring or essentially not gathered, and that parts may have been lost or harmed amid transportation or arrangement. Gastroliths may likewise not have been perceived all things considered amid gathering, since such stones were not detailed from a plesiosaur until ten years after.
