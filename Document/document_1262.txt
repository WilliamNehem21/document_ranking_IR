"Jaws" produced three continuations, none of which moved toward the accomplishment of the first. Their joined residential nets add up to scarcely 50% of the principal film's. In October 1975, Spielberg proclaimed to a film celebration gathering of people that "making a spin-off of anything is only a shoddy carny trap". In any case, he considered taking on the main spin-off when its unique chief, John D. Hancock, was terminated a couple of days into the shoot; eventually, his commitments to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", which he was dealing with Dreyfuss, made it outlandish. "Jaws 2" (1978) was in the long run coordinated by Jeannot Szwarc; Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and Jeffrey Kramer all repeated their jobs. It is by and large viewed as the best of the spin-offs. The following movie, "Jaws 3-D" (1983), was coordinated by Joe Alves, who had filled in as craftsmanship executive and creation planner, individually, on the two going before movies. Featuring Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., it was discharged in the 3-D group, despite the fact that the impact did not exchange to TV or home video, where it was renamed "Jaws 3". "" (1987), coordinated by Joseph Sargent, featuring Michael Caine, and including the arrival of Gary, is viewed as one of the most noticeably awful films at any point made. While every one of the three spin-offs made a benefit in the cinema world ("Jaws 2" and "Jaws 3-D" were among the main 20 most noteworthy earning movies of their individual years), commentators and gatherings of people alike were to a great extent disappointed with the movies.
