In Southern Rhodesia, Company authorities made a decision about the RNR to have been a triumph up until now, thus chose in January 1917 to raise a second legion. The unit as of now in the field was as of now assigned first Battalion, truncated to "1RNR", while the new development was called second Battalion, or "2RNR". Enrollment was soon under way. Aware of the trouble that had been found in inducing provincial Mashonas and Matabele to join the first Battalion in 1916, coordinators for 2RNR essentially focused on dark men from different nations, specifically vagrant specialists from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia; Nyasalanders inevitably made up about portion of the regiment. By the beginning of March, around 1,000 enlisted people were preparing in Salisbury. In the interim, 1RNR was told to watch the Igali Pass, close to the fringe with Northern Rhodesia, to keep a section of Germans from compromising the settlements of Abercorn and Fife. At the point when the Germans snuck past, the Rhodesians were destroyed back to a situation between the two towns and trained to shield possibly one as conditions managed. The Germans did not dispatch an assault, be that as it may, rather setting up camp in their own domain at Galula.
