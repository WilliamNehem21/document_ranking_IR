Expensive and elaborate ornamentation was an important part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of "Kronan", but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of "Kronan" shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus MÃ¸inichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of "Vasa", a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that MÃ¸inichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows "Kronan" as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than MÃ¸inichen's painting.
