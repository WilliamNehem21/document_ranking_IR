The annihilation of FUNCINPEC-adjusted troops in the military conflicts on 6 July 1997 added up to the compelling ouster of Ranariddh. On 9 July 1997, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry issued a white paper naming Ranariddh a "criminal" and a "double crosser", just as blaming him for plotting with the Khmer Rouge to destabilize the administration. Ranariddh headed out to the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia, where he met with Fidel Ramos, Goh Chok Tong and Suharto to look for their assistance in his reclamation. Amid his nonappearance, at a gathering meeting on 16 July 1997, Ung Huot was designated by FUNCINPEC MPs faithful to Hun Sen to supplant Ranariddh as First Prime Minister. Huot was in this way supported as First Prime Minister amid a National Assembly sitting on 6 August 1997. A couple of days after the fact, Sihanouk communicated his despondency over the conflicts, and took steps to abandon the honored position and assume control over the prevalence. Sihanouk likewise asserted that Ranariddh's ouster was illegal, and at first would not underwrite Ung Huot's arrangement, yet later yielded when Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) part states upheld Ung Huot's arrangement. In September 1997, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan met independently with Ranariddh and Hun Sen, to intercede the arrival of FUNCINPEC government officials and get ready for the 1998 Cambodian general decisions. The UN suggested that its delegates screen the races, to which both Ranariddh and Hun Sen concurred, however Hun Sen demanded that Ranariddh be set up to deal with court indictments, to which Ranariddh reacted with a risk to blacklist the decision.
