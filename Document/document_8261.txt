The degree to which cash or support influenced the result of the race is vague. Congressman Burton expressed, "I never observed any proof of the utilization of cash in Columbus and don't trust that any cash was utilized corruptly." In a meeting after Hanna's demise, James Rudolph Garfield, child of the late president and floor pioneer of the Hanna powers in the Ohio Senate, reviewed that the representative "had been approached to close his eyes to certain things. Be that as it may, he declined to do it." However, Garfield likewise noted, "I have never been certain about what a portion of the men who considered themselves Senator Hanna's companions truly did." Croly trusted that Hanna did not by and by approve influences of administrators, yet surrenders that Hanna's supporters "may have been happy to burn through cash in Mr. Hanna's advantage and without his insight." The biographer proposed, "If Mr. Hanna had himself intended to buy the vote of John C. Otis, it is sensible to trust that the business would have been exceptional overseen." Horner trusts it difficult to learn if debasement occurred, yet on the off chance that Hanna paid off officials, it was on the grounds that it was a typical practice on the two sides. He notes of Hanna, "his vocation as a representative proceeded, yet allegations of bad behavior remain a piece of his heritage well over a century later." Public overwhelm at what was viewed as a degenerate methods for picking government administrators was a main consideration in the sanction of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the benefit of choosing congresspersons out of express lawmakers' hands and offered it to the general population.
