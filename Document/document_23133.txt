Each game in the "World of Mana" series was different, both from each other and from the previous games in the series. "Children" is an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the DS, developed by Nex Entertainment; "Dawn" is a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; "Friends" is a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; and "Heroes" is a real-time strategy game for the DS, developed by Brownie Brown. While Ishii was the designer for all four games, he served as the director and producer for "Dawn", which was considered the main game of the four and was released as "Seiken Densetsu 4" in Japan. The theme of the subseries for Ishii, especially "Dawn", was about exploring how to add "the feeling of touch" to a game. He had held off on designing new "Mana" games after "Legend" was unable to meet his desires, until he felt that technology had improved enough to let him create what he envisioned. A fifth game for the subseries was considered for the Wii in 2006, but did not enter development. In April 2007, a month after the release of the final game of the "World of Mana", Ishii left Square Enix to lead his own development company, named Grezzo.
