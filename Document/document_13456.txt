In 2011, Snively and Jessica M. Theodor directed a limited component investigation by reproducing head-impacts with CT filtered skulls of "S. validum" (UALVP 2), "Prenocephale prenes" and a few surviving head-butting artiodactyls. They found that the connections between's head-striking and skull morphologies found in the living creatures additionally existed in the examined pachycephalosaurs. "Stegoceras" and "Prenocephale" both had skull shapes like the bighorn sheep with cancellous bone ensuring the cerebrum. They additionally shared similitudes in the appropriation of minimized and cancellous districts with the bighorn sheep, white-bellied duiker and the giraffe. The white-bellied duiker was observed to be the nearest morphological simple to "Stegoceras"; this head-butting species has an arch which is littler however correspondingly adjusted. "Stegoceras" was preferred fit for dispersing power over artiodactyls that butt heads at high powers, however the less vascularized arches of more seasoned pachycephalosaurs, and conceivably decreased capacity to mend from wounds, contended against such battle in more seasoned people. The examination likewise tried the impacts of a keratinous covering of the vault, and discovered it to help in execution. However "Stegoceras" did not have the pneumatic sinuses that are found underneath the purpose of effect in the skulls of head-striking artiodactyls, it rather had vascular swaggers which could have comparatively gone about as props, just as conductors to bolster the advancement of a keratin covering.
