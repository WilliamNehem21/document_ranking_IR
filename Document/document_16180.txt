The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in YucatÃ¡n and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan DÃ­az de Velasco's retreat from near Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and "oidor" JosÃ© de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed "oidor" BartolomÃ© de AmÃ©squeta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. AmÃ©squeta marched his men through torrential rain from CahabÃ³n to MopÃ¡n, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between GarcÃ­a's forces and the Itza. AmÃ©squeta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at MopÃ¡n. Captain DÃ­az de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars CristÃ³bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjKÊ¼ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on DÃ­az's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from MopÃ¡n on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at RÃ­o Chakal. The two forces combined, giving DÃ­az a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxBÊ¼ol, near the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, AjKÊ¼ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to NojpetÃ©n.
