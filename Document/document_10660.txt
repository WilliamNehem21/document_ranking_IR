Rulers seem to be like specialists, yet a few morphological highlights separate the two standings from one another. The ruler's body is typically bigger. Ocelli are very grown, however the eyes on the ruler are not expanded. The structure of the pterothorax (the wing-bearing zone of the thorax) is reliable with other regenerative ants, however it doesn't involve as quite a bit of its mesosomal mass. The wings of the rulers are decreased to the point that they are not utilitarian (they are brachypterous). Their wings are simple and squat, scarcely covering the first gastral portion. Guys look like those of "Myrmecia", yet "Nothomyrmecia" guys bear a solitary midsection hub. The wings on the male subterranean insect are not squat like a queen's; fairly they are long and completely created, showing a crude venational supplement. They have a jugal butt-centric flap (a part of the hindwing), a component found in numerous crude ants, and basal hamuli (snare like projections that connect the forewings and hindwings). Most male examples gathered have two tibial goads (spines situated on the distal end of the tibia); the main goad is a long calcar and the second goad is short and thick. Grown-ups have a stridulatory organ on the ventral side of the guts Ã¢ÂÂ not at all like every single other hymenopteran in which such organs are found dorsally.
