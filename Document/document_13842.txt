Vertebrate fossil discovers, particularly of marine reptiles, made Anning's notoriety, yet she made various different commitments to early fossil science. In 1826 she found what had all the earmarks of being a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil. She indicated it to her companion Elizabeth Philpot who had the capacity to revivify the ink and use it to outline her very own portion ichthyosaur fossils. Before long other nearby specialists were doing likewise, as increasingly such fossilized ink chambers were found. Anning noticed how intently the fossilized chambers took after the ink sacs of current squid and cuttlefish, which she had analyzed to comprehend the life structures of fossil cephalopods, and this drove William Buckland to distribute the end that Jurassic belemnites had utilized ink for safeguard similarly the same number of present day cephalopods do. It was likewise Anning who seen that the strangely formed fossils at that point known as "bezoar stones" were once in a while found in the stomach locale of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noticed that if such stones were torn open they frequently contained fossilized fish bones and scales, and now and then bones from little ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilized dung and proposed so to Buckland in 1824. After further examination and correlation with comparable fossils found in different spots, Buckland distributed that end in 1829 and named them coprolites. As opposed to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a couple of years sooner, for which she was not credited, when Buckland exhibited his discoveries on coprolites to the Geological Society, he referenced Anning by name and commended her aptitude and industry in illuminating the secret.
