Friday saw yet more observers for the indictment, bringing the all out brought by Davy to around 60. The safeguard scrutinized a few of those present at the first pursuit of Wells' home. Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was interrogated about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the arraignment obviously trying to set up whether she could have been continued for a month by the bread she professed to have been given. On the third day of the preliminary, Mrs Canning was conveyed to the stand. One conceivable line of resistance for her girl was just that she was too inept to even think about having at any point developed the story, however under interrogation by Davy Mrs Canning exhibited that her little girl was equipped for stating "a bit". This, in Davy's view, was adequate to exhibit that she was unquestionably no moron. Scarrat was addressed straightaway, and conceded that he had been to Wells' home before Canning had vanished. Two of Canning's neighbors vouched for her "unfortunate condition". Her boss was addressed, just like her pharmacist, who believed that Canning would have been very ready to get by on the pitcher of water and outsides of bread she professed to have been given. The resistance reacted with three observers, who each trusted that they had experienced a "poor, hopeless lowlife" toward the finish of January, when she professed to have gotten away.
