The State Highway Commission chose to reroute SRÃÂ 67 through Lakeside in 1954, drawing it nearer to the San Diego River and far from the downtown area, utilizing the land some time ago involved by the old railroad. In 1961, the development of the San Vicente Freeway was recorded as a high-need venture by the California Chamber of Commerce. Amid 1964, the area of San Diego got $1ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) to build SRÃÂ 67 as a turnpike from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon. Another $1ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) was distributed in 1965, and the task was reached out to I-8. The turnpike from I-8 to Pepper Drive was finished by 1967, when Caltrans declared that "yellow, non-reflectorized markers mixed with raised yellow dabs" would be introduced on the road part to portray the shoulder; this was the principal area to utilize them in the province. By December 1968, the expressway was finished from I-8 north to Woodside Avenue; the level at the northern end was smoothed out amid the enlarging of the street in mid 1970. In March, the turnpike was under development from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River, at an expense of $3.2ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars). The interstate segment opened on OctoberÃÂ 12, 1970; it was developed four paths wide.
