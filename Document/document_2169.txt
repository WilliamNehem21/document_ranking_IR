The Texian armed force had continued their walk eastbound. On April 16, they went to a junction; one street drove north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg. Without requests from Houston and with no discourse among themselves, the troops in the number one spot took the way to Harrisburg. They landed on April 18, not long after the Mexican armed force's takeoff. That equivalent day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes caught a Mexican dispatch conveying knowledge on the areas and feasible arrangements of the majority of the Mexican troops in Texas. Understanding that Santa Anna had just a little power and was not far away, Houston gave a stirring discourse to his men, admonishing them to "Recall the Alamo" and "Recollect Goliad". His military at that point hustled towards Lynchburg. Out of worry that his men probably won't separate between Mexican troopers and the "Tejanos" in SeguÃÂ­n's organization, Houston initially requested SeguÃÂ­n and his men to stay in Harrisburg to monitor the individuals who were too sick to even think about traveling rapidly. After boisterous dissents from SeguÃÂ­n and Antonio Menchaca, the request was repealed, given the "Tejanos" wear a bit of cardboard in their caps to distinguish them as Texian warriors.
