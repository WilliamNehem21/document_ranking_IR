On 15 October 1936, the main shipment of 50 Soviet T-26 light tanks landed at Cartagena. These were put into battle as ahead of schedule as 26 October, under the authority of Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Semyon Krivoshein, south of Madrid. The principal battle task in Spain for the T-26 was close to the town of SeseÃÂ±a, when a Republican tank organization counterattacked against the lead of the Nationalist's drive towards Madrid. The counterattack, albeit halfway effective, did not obstruct the Nationalist development. By the start of the activity, the tanks had isolated themselves from the infantry, tailing them. In any case, the Republican covering effectively shocked an organization of Nationalist infantrymen, who had confused then with Italian partners, and steered them. The tank organization then proceeded towards the town of Esquivias, toward the West, where they were counterattacked by rangers from the Moroccan Legion lastly compelled to pull back. Lacking infantry support, various T-26s were thumped out by Nationalist infantrymen utilizing wine bottles as bomblets. The tank organization returned through SeseÃÂ±a, which had been reoccupied by Nationalist infantry, and went under substantial flame. Notwithstanding the withdrawal, the counterattack was intensely promoted in Madrid, by the Republic, as a triumph. The absence of accomplishment is ascribed to the absence of coordination between Republican tanks, infantry and gunnery. Despite the fact that it's normally referenced that Spain gotten 312 T-26s, this number incorporates 16 FTs, conveyed by Poland, and 15 T-26s which never really made it to Spain. At last, 281 T-26s were conveyed to Spain amid the Spanish Civil War.
