The holotype specimen is the only known "Xixiasaurus" fossil, and consists of an almost complete skull except for the hindmost portion, as well as a partial right forelimb. The connection between the (forehead bone) and (bone running at the upper length of the snout) bones is displaced, and part of the is missing. Most of the snout is preserved, with the of the right side being well-preserved. Only the front part of the left (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) and some of its broken teeth are preserved. Though several teeth are missing from both jaws, their original number can be determined in the upper jaw, since their sockets there are preserved. The forelimb (of which all preserved parts are ) consists of the middle part of the and (bones of the lower arm), the extremity of the second and third (hand bones), the complete first finger, and the first of the second finger. In 2014, the palaeontologist Takanobu Tsuihiji and colleagues stated that a bone LÃ¼ and colleagues had originally identified as the (part of the ) of "Xixiasaurus" was instead part of the or (the main bones of the upper jaw), based on comparison with the vomer of the more complete troodontid "Gobivenator".
