He reared and sold cultivars of numerous hues from bronze to white to purple, which spread crosswise over Europe during the 1850s. The bracts of these early structures would in general remain measured around the blossom head instead of straighten out like the local Australian structures. These were likewise yearly instead of perpetual structures. Many were given cultivar names, for example, 'atrococcineum' (dull red blossom heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dim dark red bloom heads), 'aureum' (brilliant yellow blossom heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow bloom heads), 'compositum' (vast diverse bloom heads), 'macranthum' (huge rose-edged white blossom heads), and 'monstrosum' (blossom heads with numerous bracts), albeit today they are commonly sold in blended seed for developing as annuals. Some hued types of South African "Helichrysum" are thought to have been acquainted with the rearing project, which brought about the enormous cluster of hues. "X. bracteatum" was one of a few animal varieties that wound up famous with European sovereignty and honorability from the mid nineteenth century, yet were minimal seen in Australia until the 1860s, when they turned out to be increasingly noticeable in Australian greenery enclosures.
