After Lycett Green had revealed to Coventry what he had seen, the last gathered Williams, who was a shared companion of both the ruler and Gordon-Cumming. Lycett Green rehashed the claim once. Williams later described that he was "stunned and overpowered with a feeling of cataclysm", and said that Edward must be educated right away. There was some contradiction between the subjects on whether to tell the sovereign; Coventry and Wilson both idea it the correct move, yet Arthur Somerset felt that the issue could and ought to be managed by those present. Later he was convinced that advising the sovereign was the correct game-plan. Lycett Green developed progressively hostile all through the dialogs, and took steps to denounce Gordon-Cumming openly at the races the next day; he additionally expressed that "I won't be involved with letting Gordon-Cumming prey on society in future". The men chose that Gordon-Cumming should sign a report conceding his blame in return for their quiet, and Williams and Coventry went to Edward to advise him of what had been going on. The two men told the sovereign that "the proof they had heard was totally definitive and they didn't trust Sir William Gordon-Cumming had any reason to be taken seriously".
