USÂ 113 heads northeast from US 13 as a four-lane divided highway and intersects American Legion Drive (unsigned MDÂ 359B), which leads to MDÂ 359 (Bypass Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Town Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting MDÂ 756 (Old Snow Hill Road). USÂ 113 parallels the left bank of the Pocomoke River and crosses many streams that drain into the river, including Pilchard Creek, Bachelors Branch, Mataponi Creek, Corkers Creek, and Hardship Branch. USÂ 113 passes through Pocomoke State Forest, which preserves loblolly pine stands and bald cypress swamps along the Maryland Scenic River; by the Pocomoke River Wildlife Management Area, in which dove hunting regularly occurs; and by the Shad Landing unit of Pocomoke River State Park, which offers boating, fishing, and a nature center.
Northeast of the state park entrance, USÂ 113Â Business (Market Street) splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the county seat of Worcester County and contains several museums and colonial era buildings of the river port at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke River. USÂ 113 bypasses the town to the south and east and intersects MDÂ 12 (Snow Hill Road), which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton, and MDÂ 365 (Public Landing Road). The MDÂ 365 junction is a superstreet intersection; MDÂ 365 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along USÂ 113, and turn right again to continue on MDÂ 365. North of MDÂ 365, the highway reduces to a two-lane road and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River. USÂ 113 has a grade crossing with the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of USÂ 113Â Business.
