Jeremy Waldron checked on the book for "The New York Review of Books", and was incredulous of Lewis' wide position towards the right to speak freely as for detest discourse. Waldron later explained this situation in his 2012 book "The Harm in Hate Speech", in which he gave a whole section to Lewis' book. Waldron underlined that the issue with a sweeping perspective on free discourse isn't the mischief of disdainful contemplations, yet rather the negative effect coming about because of across the board distribution of the musings. He addressed whether offspring of racial gatherings censured by broadly distributed abhor discourse would probably prevail in such a domain. Previous U.S. Incomparable Court Justice John Paul Stevens investigated "The Harm in Hate Speech" and examined "Opportunity for the Thought That We Hate", in an audit for "The New York Review of Books". Equity Stevens related Lewis' contention that an acknowledgment of detest discourse is fundamental, since endeavors to control it would cause endless supply of disputable perspectives. He brought up that Lewis and Waldron concurred that Americans have more the right to speak freely than residents of some other nation. In his audit, Stevens refered to the 2011 choice in "Snyder v. Phelps" as proof that most of the U.S. Preeminent Court bolstered the privilege of the general population to express contemptuous perspectives on issues of open significance. Stevens inferred that, in spite of the fact that Waldron was ineffective in persuading him that administrators should boycott all abhor discourse, "The Harm in Hate Speech" influenced him that administration heads should abstain from utilizing such language themselves.
