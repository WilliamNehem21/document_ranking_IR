In an antecedent to the work he would do on the Portland Vase, the 1970s saw Nigel Williams reproducing pieces of crushed Greek vases. The 1798 sinking of had taken with it part of Sir William Hamilton's second vase gathering, where it lay in pieces for the following 200 years. A rescue activity following the disaster area's 1974 disclosure uncovered around 30,935 parts, and when they were gained by the British Museum, Williams set to work recreating them. This undertaking was supported by eighteenth century illustrations of the vases by Tischbein, and appeared on TV, where the intuitive ability of Williams influenced him to turn into a TV character. "He filled in as though he were separated from everyone else, and numerous individuals recall the minute in the subsequent "Narrative" program when he articulated a four-letter word as one of his incompletely finished rebuilding efforts went to pieces before the cameras." In 1978 Williams and his group reestablished seven vases, in entire or to some degree, for a presentation at the historical center related to the eleventh International Congress of Classical Archeology. Different vases by and large did not have enough pieces staying to consider total reproductions, albeit eventually 115 individual precedents were distinguished.
