The British Prime Minister went to HMS "Tiger" in an antagonistic attitude. Wilson's political secretary Marcia Falkender later composed of "apartheidÃÂ ... on that send", with the British and Rhodesian designations isolated in all exercises outside the meeting room at Wilson's requests. In spite of the uneasy airÃ¢ÂÂaccounts from the two sides depict Wilson managing the Rhodesians very shortlyÃ¢ÂÂtalks advanced moderately easily until the subject swung to the way of the change. Wilson demanded the deserting of the 1965 constitution, the disintegration of the post-UDI government for a "wide based" multiracial between time organization and a period under a British Governor, conditions that Smith saw as commensurate to surrender, especially as the British proposed to draft and present the new constitution simply after a new trial of assessment under UK control. At the point when Smith attested on 3 December that he couldn't settle without first counseling his Cabinet in Salisbury, Wilson was chafed, pronouncing that a focal state of the summit had been that he and Smith would have emissary forces to make an arrangement. As per JÃÂ RÃÂ T Wood, Wilson and his Attorney General Sir Elwyn Jones then "tormented Smith for two long days" to attempt to get him to settle, without progress.
