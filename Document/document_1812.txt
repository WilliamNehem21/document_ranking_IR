As the risk of a German maritime assault had been expelled by the decimation of the East Asia Squadron, "Australia" was free for organization somewhere else. At first, the battlecruiser was to fill in as leader of the West Indies Squadron, with the assignment of seeking after and wrecking any German vessels that dodged North Sea barricades. "Australia" was requested to sail to Jamaica by means of the Panama Canal, however as it was shut to overwhelming delivery, she was compelled to cruise down the bank of South America and go through the Strait of Magellan amid 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915Ã¢ÂÂ"Australia" is the main ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by cruising under South America. Amid the intersection, one of the warship's propellers was harmed, and she needed to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Transitory fixes were made, and "Australia" left on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the standard delivery courses was spotted on the evening of the following day, and the battlecruiser endeavored to seek after, yet was hampered by the harmed propeller. Unfit to close the hole before dusk, a notice shot was discharged from 'A' turret, which caused the shipÃ¢ÂÂthe previous German traveler liner, presently maritime assistant "Eleonora Woermann"Ã¢ÂÂ to stop and be caught. As "Australia" couldn't extra enough work force to verify and work the vendor ship, and "Eleonora Woermann" was too moderate to even think about keeping pace with the battlecruiser, the German team were taken on board and the ship was sunk.
