Notwithstanding the missing UNMOs, the British government confronted political and discretionary issues. The organization of British troops to Sierra Leone had lifted spirit and stopped the RUF advance on Freetown, and there were worries that brutality would continue once the British left. Another outcome of the British activity was that it adequately sidelined UNAMSIL. The United Nations and a few of the contributing countries to UNAMSIL connected weight on the British government to coordinate its powers into UNAMSIL, yet the MoD needed confidence in the ability of UNAMSIL central station and was reluctant to put its troops under UNAMSIL direction. The MoD was likewise hesitant to send the detachment estimated drive important to assume responsibility for UNAMSIL, given the military's duties somewhere else, and in this manner the British power in Sierra Leone stayed outside UNAMSIL. The British government was likewise hesitant to submit British troops to an open-finished peacekeeping task, particularly given the resistance in the House of CommonsÃ¢ÂÂespecially from the Conservative PartyÃ¢ÂÂto the underlying arrangement to Sierra Leone, and allegations from the British media of "mission creep". On the other hand, the task was generally welcomed on the worldwide stage, and met with the endorsement of the UN Security Council.
