The band received acclaim for the quality of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called "Holy Wood" their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. "LA Weekly" said that "almost all [of the songs] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." "Hot Press" praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that ""Holy Wood" is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they "play tighter than [ever] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)Â ... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of "Rolling Stone" commended him for "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." "Billboard" magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. "Revolver" editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like "Plastic Ono Band", "Holy Wood" screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments."
