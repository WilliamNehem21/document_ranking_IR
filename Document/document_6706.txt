In 1986, Charig and Milner recommended that its lengthened nose with numerous finely serrated teeth demonstrated that "Baryonyx" was piscivorous (fish-eating), theorizing that it hunkered on a riverbank and utilized its hook to gaff fish out of the water (like the cutting edge wild bear). Two years sooner, Taquet brought up that the spinosaurid noses from Niger were like those of the cutting edge gharial and recommended a conduct like herons or storks. In 1987, the Scottish scientist Andrew Kitchener debated the piscivorous conduct of "Baryonyx" and recommended that it would have been a scrounger, utilizing its long neck to benefit from the beginning, paws to break into a body, and its long nose (with nostrils far back for breathing) for examining the body hole. Kitchener contended that "Baryonyx" jaws and teeth were too feeble to even consider killing different dinosaurs and too substantial to even think about catching fish, with such a large number of adjustments for piscivory. As indicated by the Irish scientist Robin E. H. Reid, a searched body would have been separated by its predator and extensive creatures fit for doing as such, for example, mountain bearsÃ¢ÂÂare likewise fit for getting fish (in any event in shallow water).
