It was alluded to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the executive. At the point when the advisory group met, on February 23, 1920, Congressman Peters told individuals from the historical backdrop of the state and natives' longing to commend the centennial, incorporating with a memorial coin.

Houston wanted to underwrite the bill, the content of which had been acquired from the bill approving the 1918 Illinois Centennial half dollar. Ohio's William A. Ashbrook reviewed that he had been an individual from the board of trustees that had endorsed the Illinois charge; he had favored it and now supported the Maine bill. Minnesota's Oscar E.
