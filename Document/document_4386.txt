It required some investment before a Bishop of Lithuania was selected in light of different irreconcilable situations. The Bishop of Gniezno delegated Vito (Lithuanian: "Vitas"), a priest of the Dominican Order, to this position, yet he was not perceived by Mindaugas or acknowledged by the masses. The exercises of Vito in Lithuania are obscure, despite the fact that he is in some cases related with Mindaugas' Cathedral. At long last, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: "Kristijonas") from the Livonian Order was named. Mindaugas invested him with certain grounds in Samogitia, however very little is thought about his exercises. Authentic sources don't make reference to any sponsorship of evangelists, training of clerics, or development of houses of worship amid that time, and Bishop Christian returned to Germany in 1259, where he passed on in 1271. The foundation of Mindaugas' Cathedral stays dangerous, yet later archeological research found the remaining parts of a thirteenth century block expanding on the site of the present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general suspicion is that the remaining parts are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, worked to fulfill the concurrence with the pope. Be that as it may, as later occasions appeared, Lithuanians opposed Christianization, and Mindaugas' absolution had just an impermanent effect on further improvements.
