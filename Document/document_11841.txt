The effect of the Lombard movement on the Late Roman privileged was problematic, particularly in mix with the Gothic War; the last clash had completed in the north just in 562, when the last Gothic fortification, Verona, was taken. Numerous men of methods (Paul's "possessores") either lost their lives or their merchandise, yet the definite degree of the raid of the Roman privileged is a subject of warmed discussion. The ministry was likewise incredibly influenced. The Lombards were generally agnostics, and showed little regard for the pastorate and Church property. Numerous churchmen left their sees to escape from the Lombards, similar to the two most senior religious administrators in the north, Honoratus and Paulinus. Be that as it may, the majority of the suffragan clerics in the north looked for a settlement with the Lombards, as did in 569 the religious administrator of Tarvisium, Felix, when he ventured to the Piave waterway to conference with Alboin, getting regard for the Church and its products as a byproduct of this demonstration of praise. It appears to be sure that numerous sees kept up a continuous episcopal progression through the unrest of the intrusion and the next years. The change was facilitated by the threatening vibe existing among the northern Italian clerics towards the papacy and the realm because of the religious question including the "Three-Chapter Controversy". In Lombard domain, churchmen were in any event beyond any doubt to keep away from supreme religious abuse.
