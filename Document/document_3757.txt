Asturias utilizes allegorical language to portray dream symbolism and the nonsensical. Artistic faultfinder Hughes Davies calls attention to that Asturias much of the time bids to the peruser's sound-related faculties. Asturias' frequently incantatory style utilizes "unadulterated verse to strengthen his symbolism through sound". This encourages perusers to comprehend the physical just as the mental parts of the novel. As indicated by Knightly, "few of Asturias' characters have much mental profundity; their internal clashes will in general be externalized and happened at the model dimension". All the more essentially, Asturias was the main Latin American writer to consolidate continuous flow composing and metaphorical language. Hughes Davies contends that from the beginning of , the hole among words and the truth is exemplified through likeness in sound, analogy and reiteration of expressions. Chivalrous notes that "animistic components surface once in a while in the characters' continuous flow". For instance, in the part "Tohil's Dance", Tohil, the God of Rain in Maya folklore, is envisioned by Angel Face as arriving "riding on a waterway of pigeons' bosoms which streamed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil requests a human penance and is content just insofar as he "can beat men who are seekers of men". Tohil articulates: "From this time forward there will be neither genuine demise nor genuine life. Presently move." As Knightly clarifies, this scene pursues the President's requests for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that closes in his demise, and is "an indication of the President's malevolent nature and purposes". Davies fights that these abstract systems, when "consolidated together with an intermittent structure, give the content its surrealistic and nightmarish climate".
