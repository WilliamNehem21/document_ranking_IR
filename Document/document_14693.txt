The motivation behind the Wizernes site had been hazy preceding its catch however Sanders had the capacity to conclude its association with the V-2 from the elements of the unpredictable and some insight data that his group had the capacity to recover. Sanders' report presumed that it was "a gathering site for long shots most helpfully took care of and arranged in a vertical position". He guessed the inexact length of the shots from the tallness of the "Gustav" and "Gretchen" burrows, however he noticed that there was some uncertainty about the stature of the entryways at the passage passageways. Fragments of the entryways had been recuperated from a capacity dump close Watten railroad station, yet were inadequate. In light of the span of the passage entrance, the most extreme size of the shot could have been between and long and in broadness. (This was significantly bigger than the V-2, which estimated long and wide.) Two observers met by the Sanders group revealed "a goal of terminating a shot 18 meters in length". Sanders noticed that "the components of the site make it appropriate for the A.4 (V-2) rocket, however the likelihood of another rocket up to half as long again as the A.4 and double the weight can't be precluded." He reasoned that a great part of the site was getting to be dangerous because of the dynamic breakdown of timbering and prescribed that the passages and activities under the vault ought to be demolished to avoid resulting mishaps or abuse.
