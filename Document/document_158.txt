Determined, Bruce was chosen Chairman of the recently shaped FAO Council in November 1947, working yet again with John Boyd Orr, presently Secretary-General of the FAO. Intense deficiencies of oats and animals were uncontrolled after extreme dry seasons in Europe, and the universal sustenance supply framework was under genuine strain after the decimation of the war. Bruce and the committee worked in these years to disperse compost and agrarian hardware, just as improve nourishment, particularly in less created countries. More than 66% of the world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it basic for the Council to convey these distinct realities to the created countries. A milestone concession to specialized guide between the FAO and the United Nations was come to in November 1949, and the FAO got the subsidizing and calculated ability to follow up on the nourishment lack emergency and the issues of poor sustenance in the creating scene. Bruce and the FAO were fruitful in these years in supporting the recuperation of world farming yield. By 1951 this had surpassed pre-war levels, and general dimensions of nourishment were rising globally, however when Bruce ventured down in that year neither had improved quick enough to keep pace with the post-war populace blast. The Council confronted real impediments in supporting the improvement of conditions in the creating scene as governments there started redirecting assets to arms programs as freedom, post-pilgrim and Cold War clashes increased. Baffled by proceeding with world clash and the absence of duty from the created world to help the grandiose yet troublesome points of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr left the FAO frustrated by its unassuming increases and deficient forces to ease world nourishment issues.
