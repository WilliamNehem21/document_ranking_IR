McNair got the privileged level of LL.D. from Purdue University in 1941 and the University of Maine in 1943. The Lesley J. McNair Bridge was a brief structure over the Rhine River in Cologne, Germany; it remained from 1945 until it was destroyed after the erection of a changeless scaffold in 1946. Washington Barracks in Washington, D.C. was renamed Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1948. Streets and structures on a few U.S. Armed force posts convey the name "McNair", including McNair Avenue and McNair Hall (Fort Sill), McNair Road (Joint Base MyerÃ¢ÂÂ Henderson Hall), McNair Drive (Fort Monroe), and McNair Hall (Fort Leavenworth). McNair Barracks in Berlin, Germany was named for Lesley J. McNair. The office was shut as a U.S. army base in 1994, and has since been redeveloped, yet holds an exhibition hall which subtleties its utilization as a U.S. base. McNair Kaserne in HÃÂ¶chst, Germany was likewise named in his respect. Home to a few Army Signal Corps units, it was shut and swung over to the German government in 1992, and has since been redeveloped as private and business space. Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5263 in Lawton, Oklahoma (close to the Fort Sill Artillery Center and School) is named for him.
