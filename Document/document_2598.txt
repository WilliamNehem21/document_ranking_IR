Prior to the twelfth century, Jain essayists had overwhelmed Kannada writing with their "champu" (stanzas blended with composition) style of works well known in court writing. In the later medieval period, they needed to fight with the Veerashaivas who tested the very idea of regal writing with their "vachana" verse, a stylised type of spoken language, increasingly mainstream in society classes. The prevalent development of Veerashaiva (aficionados of the Hindu god Shiva) writing started in the twelfth century, while Vaishnava (lovers of the Hindu god Vishnu) essayists started to apply their impact from the fifteenth century. Jain scholars needed to reexamine their craft, moving far from the customary subjects of renunciation and precepts to concentrate on contemporary themes. Andayya's thirteenth century exemplary "Kabbigara Kava" ("Poets safeguard") was an early case of the change in artistic style, and furthermore mirrored the antagonistic vibe toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain creator thought that it was perfect to portray the narrative of Manmatha, the God of Love, who transformed Shiva into a half lady. The Veerashaivas had started a vital change, throwing away the idea of formal writing and clearing path for shorter neighborhood classes. The Vaishnava haridasas later promoted melodic structures that were increasingly worthy to the basic man. Composed works of art lauding lords and leaders were a relic of past times. Kannada writing had drawn nearer to the spoken and sung society customs, with singability being its trademark, and dedication to God its objective.
