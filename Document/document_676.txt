Perot was a bird of prey on the Vietnam War, a backer for U.S. servicemen held as captive and a supporter for their families. Amid the war, he supported fighters by giving supplies and holding revitalizes to those returning home. In open issues, he drove the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 at the command of Republican Governor Bill Clements, and was placed accountable for the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor Mark White. Perot's most dear political exertion included the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He worked broadly to free fighters that he accepted had been abandoned, and even occupied with mystery conciliatory chats with the Vietnamese government, to the vexation of the Reagan White House. Perot had been steady of President Ronald Reagan and named him as an "incredible president" in 1986. He even promised $2.5 million to help his presidential library, however the relationship soured after Perot was sent on an outing to Hanoi, and decided a short time later that the organization was not taking the POW/MIA issue truly. He renounced his vow to the library in 1987, in view of the POW/MIA issue just as his thwarted expectation from the organization's activities amid the IranÃ¢ÂÂ Contra issue. He turned into a faultfinder of the George H. W. Shrubbery organization, and contradicted the 1991 Gulf War.
