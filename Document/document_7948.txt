From the Lindley Library, Stearn ("see 1950 Photograph") moved to the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, and when he resigned in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now accomplished his point of turning into an examination researcher, in spite of absence of formal capabilities, empowering him to invest a greater amount of his energy gathering and contemplating plants. Amid this time the exhibition hall was experiencing unfaltering development, with new staff and projects. At the historical center he was placed accountable for Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham and Hooker framework, i.e., Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the locales of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including chip away at the gallery's "Greenery of Jamaica" and the Nepal verdure he began take a shot at amid the war. Seven volumes of the "Greenery of Jamaica" had showed up before the Second World War. Despite the fact that the venture was resuscitated after the war, and Stearn did a half year of field work in Jamaica, it never happened as intended; no further volumes showed up. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the strides of Sir Hans Sloane (1660Ã¢ÂÂ 1753), whose gathering had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's nonexclusive work at the gallery focused on "Allium", "Lilium" and "Paeonia". He kept on voyaging broadly, with field work in Europe (especially Greece), Australia, and the United States, and distributed 200 papers amid his twenty-four years at the exhibition hall, and despite the fact that the library was not his obligation, he invested much energy there adding composed notes to a large number of the basic writings.
