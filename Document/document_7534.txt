Side two of "Gossipy tidbits" starts with "The Chain", one of the record's most entangled arrangements. A Christine McVie demo, "Keep Me There", and a Nicks tune were re-cut in the studio and were intensely altered to frame portions of the track. The entire of the band made the rest utilizing a methodology much the same as making a film score; John McVie gave a conspicuous solo utilizing a fretless low register guitar, which denoted an accelerating in beat and the beginning of the tune's last third. Roused by R&B, "You Make Loving Fun" has a less complex organization and highlights a clavinet, an exceptional kind of console instrument, while the cadence area plays interlocking notes and beats. The ninth track on "Gossipy tidbits", "I Don't Want to Know", utilizes a twelve string guitar and orchestrating vocals. Affected by the music of Buddy Holly, Buckingham and Nicks made it in 1974 preceding they were in Fleetwood Mac. "Gracious Daddy" was made precipitously and incorporates extemporized low pitch guitar designs from John McVie and console blips from Christine McVie. The collection closes with "Gold Dust Woman", a melody enlivened by free jazz, which has music from a harpsichord, a Fender Stratocaster guitar, and a dobro, an acoustic guitar whose sound is delivered by at least one metal cones.
