Armstrong referenced a short stop at Catania, on the island of Sicily, most likely on June 29, visiting the Catania Cathedral and Mount Etna. Their next stop was at Naples on June 30, where they were welcomed by the Prefect of Naples, the Commanding General and Admiral of Naples, and Celso Caesar Moreno, introducing himself to neighborhood authorities as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii. Moreno was a companion of KalÃÂkaua's who many felt was an extortionist. Armstrong depicted him as somebody who defrauded his way into KalÃÂkaua's great graces in Hawaii. Moreno had been selected Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1880. He made a troublesome circumstance that put the King inconsistent with his very own bureau, prompting Moreno's expulsion five days after the fact. He and KalÃÂkaua stayed on warm terms. Moreno had been selected the gatekeeper of three Hawaiian understudies, including the future dissident pioneers Robert NapuÃÂ»uako Boyd and Robert William Wilcox, who were being taught in Italy as a piece of the administration subsidized examination abroad program. Moreno was diminished of that duty once the King was made mindful that Moreno had distorted them as KalÃÂkaua's regular children, and that he had deceived the Italian government into trusting he had an official position with the Hawaiian government. The "Saturday Press" in Honolulu was irate at his relationship with KalÃÂkaua and their re-association in Italy, expressing that Moreno "Ã¢ÂÂ¦ ÃÂ had battled to the last dump, and has, we trust, tumbled into it and will stay there."
