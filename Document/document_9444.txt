The International Cricket Council (ICC), in charge of running the amusement around the world, led a preliminary in 2002 where lbw advances could be alluded to a match official, the third umpire, to survey on TV replays. The third umpire could just utilize innovation to figure out where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC passed judgment on the investigation ineffective and did not seek after it. More preliminaries followed in 2006, in spite of the fact that ball-following innovation stayed inaccessible to coordinate authorities. After a further arrangement of preliminaries, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into worldwide cricket where groups could allude the on-field choices of umpires to a third umpire who approached TV replays and innovation, for example, ball following. As indicated by the ICC's general administrator, Dave Richardson, DRS expanded the recurrence with which umpires granted lbw choices. In a 2012 meeting, he stated: "Umpires may have understood that on the off chance that they give somebody out and DRS indicates it was not out, at that point their choice can be redressed. So they may, I assume, have the boldness of their feelings more and adopt a less preservationist strategy to giving the batsman out. I think whether we're absolutely genuine, DRS has influenced the diversion somewhat more than we suspected it would."
