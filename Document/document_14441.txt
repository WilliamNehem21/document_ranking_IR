The Panthers have three outdoors fields beside Bank of America Stadium where they as of now hold their works on; amid the 1995 season, when the group played their home amusements in South Carolina, the group held their practices at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Since the training fields, alongside the arena, are situated in uptown Charlotte, the fields are legitimately noticeable from high rises just as from a four-story townhouse situated over the road. As indicated by Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers' division rivals had pooled their assets to buy a room on the structure's top floor, and that a flame at the townhouse was brought about by the Panthers association. So as to keep individuals from seeing inside the field while the group is rehearsing, the group has included "deliberately planted trees and a covering over theÃÂ ... fence encompassing the fields". Also, they utilize a security group to look for and pursue away any individuals who stop close by the fence encompassing the field. In case of awful climate, the group moves their practices to an indoor games office around 10 miles from the arena. The group does not possess this office. The Panthers have facilitated their yearly preparing camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, since 1995.
