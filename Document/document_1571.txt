Welles laid out the taphonomy of the first examples, changes that occurred amid their rot and fossilization. The holotype skeleton was discovered lying on its correct side, and its head and neck were recurvedcurved backwardsin the "demise present" in which dinosaur skeletons are frequently found. This posture was believed to be opisthotonus (because of death-fits) at the time, yet may rather have been the consequence of how a remains was inserted in residue. The back was straight, and the rearmost dorsal vertebrae were turned on their left sides. The caudal vertebrae expanded unpredictably from the pelvis, and the legs were verbalized, with little relocation. Welles reasoned that the examples were covered at the spot of their demises, without having been transported much, yet that the holotype example seems to have been exasperates by foragers, shown by the turned dorsal vertebrae and pounded skull. Gay noticed that the examples he depicted in 2001 demonstrated proof of having been transported by a stream. As none of the examples were finished, they may have been transported over some separation, or have lain superficially and endured for quite a while before transport. They may have been transported by a flood, as shown by the assortment of creatures found as pieces and bone breakage.
