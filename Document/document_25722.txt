In June 1796, FÃ¼rstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the "Freikorps" (Volunteers) "Gyulay" and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and Rastatt. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle crossed the Rhine and chased the Swabian Circle's military contingent out of Kehl. In June 1796, Archduke Charles added the contingent to FÃ¼rstenberg's command, making him the Swabian's "Feldzeugmeister", or General of Infantry. FÃ¼rstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley. The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and FÃ¼rstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. FÃ¼rstenberg held Kenzingen, north of Riegel on the Elz River. Karl Aloys zu FÃ¼rstenberg was ordered to feint against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel.
