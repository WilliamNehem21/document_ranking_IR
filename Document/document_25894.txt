In 1986, Charig and Milner named a new genus and species with the skeleton as holotype specimen: "Baryonyx walkeri". The generic name derives from ancient Greek; Î²Î±ÏÏÏ ("barys") means "heavy" or "strong", and á½Î½ÏÎ¾ ("onyx") means "claw" or "talon". The specific name honours Walker, for discovering the specimen. At that time, the authors did not know if the large claw belonged to the hand or the foot (as in dromaeosaurs, which it was then assumed to be). The dinosaur had been presented earlier the same year during a lecture at a conference about dinosaur systematics in Drumheller. Due to ongoing work on the bones (70 percent had been prepared at the time), they called their article preliminary and promised a more detailed description at a later date. "Baryonyx" was the first large Early Cretaceous theropod found anywhere in the world by that time. Before the discovery of "Baryonyx" the last significant theropod find in the United Kingdom was "Eustreptospondylus" in 1871, and in a 1986 interview Charig called "Baryonyx" "the best find of the century" in Europe. "Baryonyx" was widely featured in international media, and was nicknamed "Claws" by journalists punning on the title of the film "Jaws". Its discovery was the subject of a 1987 BBC documentary, and a cast of the skeleton is mounted at the Natural History Museum in London. In 1997, Charig and Milner published a monograph describing the holotype skeleton in detail. The holotype specimen remains the most completely known spinosaurid skeleton.
