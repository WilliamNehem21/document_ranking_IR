The principle structure is in Portland stone. It appears as a vaulted corridor or structure reminiscent of a Doric sanctuary yet open at the two finishes. After the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, it is Lutyens' second-biggest war commemoration in the United Kingdom, and is the main British First World War commemoration committed only to trader sailors. It is raised on a stage somewhat above road level, situated east to west and got to from the road by a lot of five stone strides at each end. The structure is long by wide and up to tall. It comprises of three straights on either side, made by eight exchanging square wharfs and six sets of round sections. The eight wharfs are clad in rectangular bronze boards to give the impression of rustication. The boards (partitioned into 24 numbered segments) contain the names of missing sailors, requested by ship name and after that in order following the name of the skipper or ace. The vessels of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets are recorded independently. Over the narrows is a Doric entablature. The low, pitched rooftop has shallow parapets on either side and gabled closures; on top, in the middle, is an expansive square storage room which underpins an extensive stone drum. The storage room is like Lutyens' unique structure for the York City War Memorial, which included a Stone of Remembrance instead of a drum. The sculptural component is crafted by William Reid Dick, who chipped away at a few other war commemorations, incorporating the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium.
