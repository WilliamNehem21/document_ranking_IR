French staff officers disastrously failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between Äiá»n BiÃªn Phá»§ and NÃ  Sáº£n:
First, at NÃ  Sáº£n, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support. At Äiá»n BiÃªn Phá»§, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one. GiÃ¡p compared Äiá»n BiÃªn Phá»§ to a "rice bowl," where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom. Second, GiÃ¡p made a mistake in NÃ  Sáº£n by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Äiá»n BiÃªn Phá»§, GiÃ¡p spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Artillery pieces were located within well constructed and camouflaged casemates. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns GiÃ¡p possessed. Third, the aerial resupply lines at NÃ  Sáº£n were never severed, despite Viet Minh antiaircraft fire. At Äiá»n BiÃªn Phá»§, GiÃ¡p amassed antiaircraft batteries that quickly shut down the runway, and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.
