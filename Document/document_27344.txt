The work's moralising tone is apparent from some of its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath the weight of the damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias GrÃ¼newald's "Isenheim Altarpiece", which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.
The similarities between the altarpiece and the c.Â late 1460s "Last Judgement" by van der Weyden's apprentice Hans Memling has led art historians to suggest a common tie, Florentine banker Angelo Tani, gave commissions to van der Weyden before his death in 1464. Because Memling's apprenticeship post-dated the completion and installation of the altarpiece, art historians speculate that Tani or Memling would have seen it "in situ", or that Memling came into possession of a workshop design. Two additional works with similar depictions of ChristÂ â a Martin Schongauer at the Louvre dated c.Â 1469 and another in Germany from about 1493Â â suggest the existence of the input of members of his workshop. In Memling's work the DeÃ«sis and Christ's placement, above St Michael with his scales, are almost identical to the "Beaune Altarpiece". Despite the marked similarities, the crowded scenes in Memling's "Last Judgement" contrast sharply with "the hushed serenity of Rogier's composition," according to Lane, and in a mirror image of van der Weyden's altarpiece, Memling shows the saved outweighing the damned in St Michael's scales.
