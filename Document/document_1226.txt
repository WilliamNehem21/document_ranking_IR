In the wake of moving on from secondary school, Tolliver played school football at Texas Tech University and was an individual from the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. His hard tossing style drove Texas Tech head mentor David McWilliams to state, "He tosses the ball harder, and with greater speed, than anybody I've at any point seen." He redshirted his green bean season in 1984 and turned into the beginning quarterback in 1985. On November 9, 1985, Tolliver had his first breakout execution for the Red Raiders as he tossed for a record-setting 422 yards and five touchdowns in a 63Ã¢ÂÂ 7 prevail upon Texas Christian University (TCU), an accomplishment that helped him become a commonly recognized name in Texas. As he started his sophomore season, he was viewed as the solitary splendid spot on Texas Tech's offense. Tolliver battled toward the beginning of the year; before the finish of September he had just finished 54 of 123 passes. In the wake of tossing five interferences in a diversion against Baylor, he disregarded the terrible amusement, saying, "even Betty Crocker consumes a cake from time to time." His fortunes kept on sinking when in a diversion in late October against the Rice Owls, he was sidelined, and reinforcement quarterback Monte McGuire aroused the group to a triumph. In any case, Tolliver recaptured his beginning employment and conveyed his group to the 1986 Independence Bowl as Texas Tech won six amusements out of the blue since 1978. He completed the season with 1,802 passing yards and seven touchdowns.
