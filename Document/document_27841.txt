"Minnesotan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Minnesotan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal. Hints at cargos she carried during this time can be gleaned from contemporary news reports from the "Los Angeles Times". In March 1928, for example, the newspaper reported that "Minnesotan" sailed from Los Angeles with a $2,500,000 cargo that included raw silk and of copper bullion. The 1,000 bales of silk, picked up in Seattle, were worth $1,000,000 on their own, while the load of copper was reportedly the largest water shipment of Arizona copper to that time. Canned goods, grape juice, and locally grown cotton completed the load. The "Los Angeles Times" also reported that "Minnesotan" delivered a then-record cargo from the East Coast to Los Angeles in October 1930. "Minnesotan" also carried some less-traditional cargo. In February 1928, she delivered one R-class and four six-meter (twenty-foot) sloops to Los Angeles. The five racing yachts, all from East Coast yacht clubs, arrived to sail in the national championships of six-meter and R-class sloops held 10â18 March. "Minnesotan" delivered two other six-meter sloops for new owners in November 1938.
