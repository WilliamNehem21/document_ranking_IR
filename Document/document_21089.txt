LÃª Lá»£i is the leader of an uprising against the Ming Empire. The campaign starts in 1418, where LÃª Lá»£i is leading a guerrilla band in destroying all the Ming towers in the Vietnamese villages, with the help of the Trá»nh and Nguyá»n families. He then defends a fort in ChÃ­ Linh with the help of LÃª Lai, who disguises himself as LÃª Lá»£i and sallies forth to lead a suicidal frontal assault upon the enemy, giving his life so that LÃª Lá»£i and his troops can escape, once they have destroyed the towers to the east. LÃª Lá»£i then advances upon Hanoi and succeeds in capturing the city. Afterwards, he marches towards the Ming capital of Nghá» An, but finds himself on the way there obliged to deal with a fortress garrisoned by Cam Banh, a vassal of the Chinese. The Chinese send in their veteran general, Wang Tong, to relieve the fortress, but he is too late to stop LÃª Lá»£i from capturing it. LÃª Lá»£i then splits his forces into three groups: Dinh De to lead the cavalry upon ÄÃ´ng ÄÃ´ to keep Wang Tong occupied, Le Trien to move north to intercept the Chinese reinforcements under Liu Sheng, and Luu Nhan Chu and Bui Bi to Nghá» An. Miraculously, this triple plan works, prompting the Ming to accept a peace deal. However, the local Vietnamese vassals of the Ming will not accept this, prompting a final showdown with Wang Tong. Peace is finally concluded, and Dai Viet is allowed to exist as a tributary state of the Ming.
