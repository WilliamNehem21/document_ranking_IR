After the death of TrifunoviÄ-BirÄanin in February 1943, JevÄeviÄ, along with ÄujiÄ, BaÄoviÄ, and Radovan IvaniÅ¡eviÄ, vowed to the Italians to carry on TrifunoviÄ-BirÄanin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. The Italians were able to exert pressure on JevÄeviÄ, as his brother and fiancÃ©e were interned in Italy. MihailoviÄ apparently felt that JevÄeviÄ had exceeded his authority by attending the Case White planning conference in Rome, and indeed, when the Yugoslav government-in-exile awarded JevÄeviÄ the Order of KaraÄorÄe's Star in early 1943 for his services to the Serb population during the UstaÅ¡e massacres of 1941, MihailoviÄ suppressed the announcement of the award because of the nature of JevÄeviÄ's agreement with the Italians, although the reason may also have been because he was aware of Chetnik revenge killings of Herzegovinian Catholics and Muslims in response to atrocities committed by the UstaÅ¡e in Croatia. Tensions between MihailoviÄ and JevÄeviÄ became so apparent that MihailoviÄ reportedly threatened to "string [him] up from the nearest tree". In March, JevÄeviÄ publicly demanded an end to the Chetnik killing of Croats in Herzegovina. In May, Benito Mussolini finally gave in to German pressure and ordered Italian troops to co-operate in the disarming of Chetnik groups. JevÄeviÄ was immediately placed under house arrest.
