On 1ÃÂ March 1946, No.ÃÂ 5 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, was re-framed as No.ÃÂ 1 FTS, under Southern Area Command. Its supplement of airplane included one Anson, two Tiger Moths, and 55 Wirraways, however the unit was principally in charge of the support of hardware and small flying was embraced separated from supplemental classes for pilots presenting on the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. By 1ÃÂ September 1947, No.ÃÂ 1 FTS had exchanged to Point Cook, at first as "Flying Training School", under Wing Commander Read. The RAAF's first post-war flying instructional class at the school comprised of 42 understudies and initiated in February 1948, completing in August the next year. Flight reviewing occurred following a half year of general military preparing, so, all in all understudies were chosen to be learner pilots or guides; the previous stayed at No.ÃÂ 1 FTS, while the last exchanged to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale. Not at all like some other aviation based armed forces, which set understudies into specific air ship jobs after fundamental preparing, the RAAF's theory was to give all pilots basically a similar preparing from acceptance to graduation, so they would almost certainly convert all the more effectively starting with one air ship type then onto the next as operational prerequisites developed. In September 1949, Read gave over to Squadron Leader Glen Cooper, who directed the school until August 1951.
