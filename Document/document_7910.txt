The Tahiti rail has generally been mistaken for the surviving Tongan subspecies of the buff-united rail, "Gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus", which was additionally shown and portrayed by the Forsters. In his 1783 depiction of the Tongan winged animal (wherein it was named "Rallus eucaudata"), the English ornithologist John Frederick Miller mistakenly gave its territory as Tahiti, which drove the Tahiti rail to be viewed as a lesser equivalent word of the surviving flying creature. He put together his depiction with respect to Forster's representation (plate no.127) of the Tongan winged creature, and Latham and Gmelin later rehashed Miller's incorrect region. The 1844 distribution of Forster's portrayal recorded the Tongan fowl as an assortment of the Tahitian species, and comparable plans were proposed by later scholars until 1953, when the New Zealand researcher Averil Margaret Lysaght called attention to Miller's territory botch, which had been disregarded until that point, and kept the two winged animals independent. Despite the elucidation, the Tongan fowl was set on a rundown of wiped out winged animals in the 1981 book "Jeopardized Birds of the World", and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was utilized to delineate the Samoan wood rail ("Gallinula pacifica"), a totally unique species, in the 1989 book "Le Grand Livre des EspÃÂ©cies Disparues".
