The Kingdom of Qatna was set up around 2000 BC. Toward the start of the Middle Bronze Age I, the city extended and secured a region of . This development diminished the quantity of the little settlements as individuals were drawn into the extended city. It is plausible that the most punctual notice of "Qatna" by this name dates to a similar period. As indicated by Thomas Schneider, a city named "Qedem", referenced in a dubious section in the "Account of Sinuhe" dating to the start of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (mid twentieth century BC), is most presumably to be related to Qatna. Qedem in the Egyptian content is expressed "Qdm", and, in Egyptian, Qatna is composed as "Qdn". In the event that Schneider's elucidation is right, at that point this is the principal known composed notice of the city. The content additionally makes reference to that the title of the ruler was "Mekim" (or Mekum), a regal title known from Ebla. The hypothesis of Schneider is discussed: in Sinuhe's story, the hero swung back to Qedem subsequent to achieving Byblos; Joachim Friedrich Quack called attention to that the Egyptian action word ""Ã¡Â¸Â¥s ÃÂ¯i"" utilized in the content was known to show that a specific endeavor had achieved its last goal and was currently coming back to Egypt, demonstrating that Qedem was south of Byblos, while Qatna is toward the north of Byblos.
