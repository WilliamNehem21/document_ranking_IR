Transport. USÃÂ 41 in Marquette was first appeared on a guide in 1964 after the development of the Marquette Bypass. It was later assigned Bus. USÃÂ 41/Bus. M-28 on a guide in 1975; this second assignment was expelled from maps by 1982. The whole business circle was swung back to neighborhood control in a "course swap" between the City of Marquette and MDOT reported in mid 2005. The proposition exchanged ward on the unsigned M-554 and the business course from the state to the city. The state would take ward over a portion of McClellan Avenue to be utilized to stretch out M-553 to USÃÂ 41/M-28. Moreover, MDOT would pay $2.5ÃÂ million (identical to $ in ) for remaking work got ready for 2007. The exchange would expand Marquette's operational and support obligation costs by $26,000 (equal to $ in ) and spot the money related weight of things to come substitution of a stop light on the city. On October 10, 2005, MDOT and Marquette exchanged purview over the three roadways. Accordingly, Bus. USÃÂ 41 was decommissioned when the nearby government assumed responsibility for Washington and Front avenues. Because of the decommissioning, the 2006 maps did not demonstrate the previous business circle.
