Sandringham is recorded in the Domesday Book as "sant-Dersingham" and the land was granted to a Norman knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the Conquest. The nearby collector Claude Messent, in his investigation "The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham", records the revelation of proof of the asphalts of a Roman manor. In the Elizabethan period an estate was based on the site of the present house, which, by the eighteenth century, came into the ownership of the Hoste Henley family, relatives of Dutch evacuees. In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to manufacture a Georgian house, Sandringham Hall. In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley passed on without issue, and the home was purchased at sale by John Motteux, a London trader. Motteux was likewise without beneficiaries and handed down Sandringham, together with another Norfolk domain and a property in Surrey, to the third child of his dear companion, Emily Lamb, the spouse of Lord Palmerston. At the season of his legacy in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a single guy ambassador, inhabitant in Paris. On prevailing to Motteux's homes, he sold different properties and based himself at Sandringham. He embraced expansions to the lobby, utilizing Samuel Sanders Teulon to include a detailed yard and center. Cowper's style of living was lavishÃ¢ÂÂhe and his better half invested quite a bit of their energy in the ContinentÃ¢ÂÂand inside 10 years the domain was sold for ÃÂ£89,000. The passing of their single youngster, Mary Harriette, from cholera in 1854 drove the couple to invest much more energy abroad, for the most part in Paris, and by the mid 1860s Cowper was quick to sell the bequest.
