The bigger center engraving is in French, utilizing a twelfth century content. It peruses "" ("Loyal Remembrance", or "Devoted Souvenir"), and is painted to give the feeling that it was cut into the parapet. In 1927 Hippolyte Fierens Gevaert set forward Timotheus of Miletus, a Greek performer and dithyrambic artist brought into the world 446. Gevaert held that the picture was a recognition of a court craftsman who had as of late kicked the bucket and that the established reference was proposed to compliment his memory. Panofsky to a great extent ran with this situation in 1949. He guessed that the sitter was the praised artist Gilles Binchois, by 1430 a standard at St. Donatian's Cathedral, Bruges. Campbell is distrustful, disavowing that the sitter "isn't dressed as a priest". Different speculations incorporate that the man was a Greek or Lucchese trader, Henry the Navigator, Jean deCroÃÂ¿ or, more uncertain, that it is a self-picture. In spite of the fact that there is much difference, it is likely that he was a local French speaker, and a legal official, writer, or individual from the "Compagnie du Chapel Vert" ("Society of the Green Hat") at Tournai. Dhanens rejects the hypothesis that the man was an artist on the premise that vanEyck would have made this unequivocal, depicting him holding a gadget or token obviously symbolizing music. She presumes that he is a bookkeeper or legal counselor holding a legitimate or money related report.
