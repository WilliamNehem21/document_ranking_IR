In "Specialty of the Comic Book: An Esthetic History", Robert Harvey composed that, with "Gatekeepers", Moore and Gibbons "had shown as at no other time the limit of the [comic book] medium to recount to a modern story that could be designed just in funnies". In his survey of the Absolute Edition of the gathering, Dave Itzkoff of "The New York Times" composed that the dim heritage of "Guards", "one that Moore in all likelihood never expected, whose DNA is encoded in the inexorably dark inks and dreary storylines that have turned into the basic components of the contemporary superhuman comic book," is "a space he has to a great extent surrendered to essayists and craftsmen who share his interest with ruthlessness however not his enthusiasm for its outcomes, his excitement to tear down old limits yet not his drive to discover new ones." Alan Moore himself said his aims with works like "Marvelman" and "Guardians" were to free funnies and open them up to new and new thoughts, in this way making greater decent variety in the funnies world by demonstrating the business what should be possible with officially existing ideas. Rather it had the contrary impact, causing the superhuman comic to finish up stuck in a "burdensome ghetto of bleakness and psychosis". In 2009, Lydia Millet of "The Wall Street Journal" challenged that "Guardians" was deserving of such praise, and composed that while the arrangement's "distinctively drawn boards, grouchy hues and lavish symbolism make its ubiquity merited, if unbalanced", that "it's essentially strange to attest that, as an outlined abstract story, it equals in creative legitimacy, state, gems as ware Chris' 'Top Novelty Library' or practically any piece of the clever and splendid work of Edward Gorey".
