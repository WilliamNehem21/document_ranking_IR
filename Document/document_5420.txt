Kiedis additionally had an adoration enthusiasm for Yohanna Logan, a style originator whom Kiedis met while she was working in New York City. Kiedis inclusion with Logan affected his numerous examinations of adoration all through "Californication", in melodies, for example, "Porcelain" and "This Velvet Glove." Sarcasm was an idea that Kiedis had managed before, and he at last made a tune around it. He was motivated by previous bandmate Dave Navarro, whom he viewed as the "Ruler of Sarcasm". Frusciante moved toward the guitar line present in "Scar Tissue" as an endeavor to utilize two notes that are played far separated, yet produce a "cool musicality". He had investigated this strategy on his first solo collection, 1994's "Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt". Frusciante considers "Scar Tissue" to be a "basic case of the method, yet I believe it's a style that sounds like me". The guitarist utilized slide guitar-playing for the performances in the tune. The melody "Transmit Remmus", which is "late spring" spelled in reverse, was motivated by Anthony's concise association with Melanie C of the Spice Girls.
