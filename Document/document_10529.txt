On race day California Chrome did not break intensely. Espinoza later clarified something felt "off" and he kept the pony down a bit as opposed to setting off to the lead. At the point when requested to move to the front, the pony did not release his standard burst of speed. Promptly following the race, Espinoza said "He was only somewhat void today". Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome completed fourth in a dead warmth with Wicked Strong. Starting post-race experts censured Espinoza for not taking the steed to the front at an opportune time, yet seen that California Chrome had some blood on his correct front heel. After the race, audit of photographs taken toward the begin demonstrated that the pony by him, Matterhorn, moved excessively far to one side and ventured on California Chrome's heel as the two ponies parted from the entryway. Therefore, California Chrome had run the race with a "lump" of tissue removed from his correct front heel and a little cut on his ligament. The ligament damage was shallow, yet the heel damage may have been a factor in his misfortune. Sherman clarified that he realized that something was wrong when he saw the steed toss his head up in the homestretch, and guessed later that the sand and earth of the course caused agony in the open injury. The next day, Sherman guaranteed the press that the two wounds would recuperate.
