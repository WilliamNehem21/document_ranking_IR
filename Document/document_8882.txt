While consoling Thompson and Maguire that he was just revoking the possibility that he had given his nation away, and not simply the concession (which he let them know would be regarded), Lobengula solicited Maund to go with two from his "izinDuna", Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, formally to present to her a letter lamenting Portuguese attacks on eastern Mashonaland, yet in addition informally to look for advice in regards to the emergency at Bulawayo. The mission was besides propelled by the straightforward want of Lobengula and his "izinDuna" to check whether this white ruler, whose name the British swore by, truly existed. The ruler's letter closed with a solicitation for the Queen to send her very own delegate to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw another opportunity to verify his very own concession, maybe even to Rudd's detriment, said he was glad to help, yet Lobengula stayed mindful of him: when Maund raised the subject of another concession covering the Mazoe valley, the lord answered "Take my men to England for me; and when you return, at that point I will discuss that." Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from Natal, was selected to go with the Matabele emissaries as a mediator. They left in mid-December 1888.
