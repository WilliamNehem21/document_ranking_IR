Wilton went through a year in beach front ordnance posts at North Head and Port Kembla before exchanging to the Second Australian Imperial Force. He was advanced major on 7ÃÂ May 1940 and given direction of a battery in the 2/fourth Field Regiment, some portion of the as of late shaped seventh Division, which set out for the Middle East in October. On the voyage he composed his significant other a letter on the off chance that he was slaughtered, rebuking: "Recollect what has dependably been our maximÃ¢ÂÂnothing can vanquish usÃ¢ÂÂnot by any means demise!" Appointed the division's Brigade Major Royal Artillery on 19ÃÂ March 1941, Wilton served under Brigadier Frank Berryman in the Syrian crusade, and was in charge of organizing activities amid the Battle of Merdjayoun in June. Allocated to the staff of Headquarters IÃÂ Corps, Wilton ended up General Staff Officer GradeÃÂ 2 (Artillery) on 1ÃÂ November; this would be the last big guns posting of his vocation. He was elevated to brief lieutenant colonel on 25ÃÂ November. On 30ÃÂ December, Wilton was referenced in despatches for his administration with the 7thÃÂ Division. He entered the Middle East Staff School at Haifa in January 1942, and graduated in May.
