The basic examination of the essential sources by later researchers have turned around the circumstance. Muntaner was himself an individual from the Company until 1307, yet was posted as legislative head of Djerba when the fight happened and just ordered his narrative in 1325Ã¢ÂÂ 1328, prompting some genuine blunders in his record. Gregoras, in spite of the fact that a contemporary of the fight, composed his history even later, in 1349Ã¢ÂÂ 1351, depending for the most part actually accounts; his record of the Company's exercises amid the years prior to the fight are scrappy and incorrect, and his record of the fight itself is near that of Muntaner, showing maybe that Gregoras drew on a Western source. Then again, the first French adaptation of the "Narrative of the Morea", on which every other form draw, was composed somewhere in the range of 1292 and 1320, and the shortened French rendition enduring today was gathered soon after by a very much educated creator in the Morea. The Greek and Aragonese forms, aggregated later in the century, contain basically a similar data as the French adaptation. A basic bit of proof was the disclosure and production in 1940 of a 1327 letter by Marino Sanudo, who was a kitchen chief working in the North Euboean Gulf upon the arrival of the fight. Sanudo obviously expresses that the fight occurred at Halmyros ("..."fuit bellum ducis Athenarum et comitis Brennensis cum compangna predicta advertisement Almiro""), and his declaration is for the most part thought to be dependable. Thus, later recorded investigations generally acknowledge Halmyros as the site of the fight.
