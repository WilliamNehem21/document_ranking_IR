Thomas G. Melish, a currency authority and business visionary from Cincinnati, thought of a thought for a memorial coin that he would control and from which he could benefit. Melish was a noticeable specialist who had acquired the Bromwell Wire Company. He shaped the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and verified the presentation of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have accommodated 10,000 coins from the Philadelphia Mint, 2,000 coins from Denver, and 3,000 from the San Francisco Mint. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a critical irregularity, expanding Melish's benefit. On February 17, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures prescribed that it be changed to accommodate an aggregate of 15,000 coins without managing at what mint or mints they ought to be struck. That advisory group, in its report going with the bill, noticed that the piece was "in recognition of the fiftieth (brilliant) commemoration of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a focal point of music, and its commitment of the yearly May celebration to the craft of music for as far back as 50 years." Melish, through political impact, had the capacity to hold the arrangement that they ought to be struck "at the mints", permitting coinage at all three mints. This denoted the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress during the 1930s with that expressingÃ¢ÂÂlater issues were constrained to a solitary mint.
