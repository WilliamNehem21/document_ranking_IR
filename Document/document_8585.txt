The much censured 46th (North Midland) Division made up for itself in 1918 out of a risky assault amid the Battle of St Quentin Canal. The task was effectively initiated by the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which included two regiments that were nearly disbanded in view of their supposed poor execution at Gommecourt two years sooner. The seven untested second-line divisions saw their first activities in 1917. They by and large endured, undeservedly, from poor notorieties, despite the fact that the 58th (2/first London) and 62nd (second West Riding) Divisions were all around respected by the war's end. The 51st (Highland) Division, whose men named themselves as 'duds' after a moderate begin, and the two London first-line divisions were among the best in the BEF by 1918. A notoriety for reliability brought about the 48th (South Midland) Division being exchanged to Italy to soothe the normal seventh Infantry Division in March 1918. A few regional divisions conquered poor beginning impressions to wind up powerful, trustworthy developments before the finish of the war. The 61st (second South Midland) Division, for instance, accused for the disappointment at Fromelles, was complimented by Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough, authority of the Fifth Army, as the best performing of his 11 forefront divisions in the underlying surge of the German Spring Offensive in March 1918.
