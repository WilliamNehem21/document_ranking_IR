The regiment was assembled as a feature of 2ÃÂ NZEF in September 1939 and was issued with six Bren firearm bearers. It had a central command, a base camp squadron and an assault rifle squadron; the structure was before long changed to acclimate with that of the British Divisional Cavalry Regiments, which included three battling squadrons and a home office squadron. The regiment was set up from 27 to 30 September at Ngaruawahia Military Camp, with the exception of No. 3 Squadron (later C Squadron), which was framed at Narrow Neck. It was directed by Lieutenant Colonel Caro Pierce, a World War I veteran and Military Cross beneficiary. The squadrons at Ngaruawahia were visited by Governor-General George Galway on 30 November. An uncommon walk through Auckland Domain was hung on 3 January; the following day, the regiment (with the exception of C Squadron) set out for Egypt on board the troopship RMS "Rangitata". They touched base at Port Tewfik on 13 February. The regiment landed the next day and entrained for the New Zealand base camp at Maadi, the focal stop and preparing territory for 2ÃÂ NZEF in the Middle East. In March, twelve Bren firearm bearers and five Light Tanks Mark III arrived, and tank-gunnery preparing started on the range at Abbassia; the regiment took part in unit moves at El Saff the next month. On 19 June, the regiment encountered its first casualty when Trooper Vincent Thompson kicked the bucket of meningitis.
