Subsequent to cresting in force, the tempest started debilitating because of expanding easterly wind shear from the edge toward the north, uprooting the focal point of dissemination from the most profound convection. At an opportune time MayÃÂ 14, the IMD downsized the tempest to a serious cyclonic tempest. Around this time, directing flows loosened, and the violent wind wandered northward over the focal Bay of Bengal. By late on MayÃÂ 14, convection had generally scattered, except for a little region close to the inside, and the framework debilitated to negligible cyclonic tempest status. Tempest movement kept on waxing and wind down as the tempest swung toward the southeastward, however tenacious antagonistic conditions made the tempest debilitate further to a profound dejection on MayÃÂ 16. As the close-by edge interpreted eastbound, the wretchedness had the capacity to move all the more relentlessly toward the east and later toward the upper east, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on MayÃÂ 18. On the following day, the profound sorrow re-escalated into a cyclonic tempest, achieving an optional top with winds of 85ÃÂ km/h (50ÃÂ mph). At about 10:00ÃÂ UTC on MayÃÂ 19, the tempest made landfall near Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The tempest quickly debilitated into a gloom and later deteriorated into a low weight zone on MayÃÂ 20, and was never again recognizable on satellite symbolism by the following day.
