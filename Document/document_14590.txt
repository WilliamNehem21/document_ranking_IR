Contradictions about the responsibility for story at last driven Moore to separate ties with DC Comics. Not having any desire to work under a work for contract course of action, Moore and Gibbons had an inversion provision in their agreement for "Guards". Talking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore stated: "The manner in which it works, in the event that I get it, is that DC possesses it for the time they're distributing it, and afterward it returns to Dave and me, so we can profit from the Slurpee glasses." For "Guards", Moore and Gibbons got eight percent of the arrangement's income. Moore clarified in 1986 that his comprehension was that when "DC have not utilized the characters for a year, they're our own." Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them "a considerable measure of cash" to hold the rights. Moore included, "So fundamentally they're not our own, however on the off chance that DC is working with the characters to our greatest advantage, at that point they should be. Then again, if the characters have outlasted their common life expectancy and DC wouldn't like to do anything with them, at that point following a year we have them and we can do what we need with them, which I'm splendidly content with."
