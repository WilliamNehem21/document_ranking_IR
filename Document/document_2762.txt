In December, Kan EkÃÂ¼ despatched AjChan to arrange harmony with Spain, with three Itza colleagues. They were joined to MÃÂ©rida by few Mopans from the Tipuj locale. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key job as a broker between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he additionally had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mom was from Chichen Itza in the northern YucatÃÂ¡n. His marriage to a Kowoj lady had been an endeavor, at last fruitless, to defuse ItzaÃ¢ÂÂ Kowoj antagonistic vibe. Kan EkÃÂ¼ sent AjChan to MÃÂ©rida with a message of serene accommodation to the Spanish Empire trying to harden his very own situation as sole leader of the Itza, regardless of whether this implied relinquishing Itza freedom from Spain. The Itza lord's uncle and the Kowoj were generally restricted to any dealings with the Spanish and saw AjChan's government office as bad form. The Spanish were ignorant of the pressures between various Maya groups in focal PetÃÂ©n, which at this point had swelled into a condition of between Maya fighting. AjChan was absolved as MartÃÂ­n Francisco on 31 December 1695, with MartÃÂ­n de UrsÃÂºa, legislative head of YucatÃÂ¡n, going about as his back up parent.
