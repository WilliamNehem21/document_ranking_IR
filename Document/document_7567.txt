"The Raven" was applauded by individual scholars William Gilmore Simms and Margaret Fuller, however it was decried by William Butler Yeats, who called it "devious and vulgarÃÂ ... its execution a rhythmical trap". Visionary Ralph Waldo Emerson stated, "I don't see anything in it." A pundit for the "Southern Quarterly Review" wrote in July 1848 that the ballad was destroyed by "a wild and unbridled excess" and that minor things like a tapping at the entryway and a shuddering shade would just influence "a youngster who had been startled to the skirt of ineptitude by awful apparition stories". An unknown essayist passing by the alias recommended "At night Mirror" that "The Raven" was copied from a lyric called "The Bird of the Dream" by an anonymous writer. The essayist indicated 18 similitudes between the lyrics and was made as a reaction to Poe's allegations of literary theft against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It has been recommended Outis was truly Cornelius Conway Felton, if not Poe himself. After Poe's demise, his companion Thomas Holley Chivers said "The Raven" was copied from one of his lyrics. Specifically, he professed to have been the motivation for the meter of the ballad just as the hold back "nevermore".
