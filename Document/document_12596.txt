Mill operator had driven his group to triumph in the 1953Ã¢ÂÂ 54 Sheffield Shield and was perceived as a natural chief. In view of on cricketing merit, Miller, an ordinary choice at global dimension, was viewed as the unrivaled hopeful. Nonetheless, between state competitions and a recognition that Miller would be a poor slave driver saw him disregarded. This discernment was somewhat founded on an episode when Miller, as commander of New South Wales, permitted his colleague Sid Barnes to serve drinks on the field wearing a tuxedo as opposed to standard cricket whites. Johnson, then again, was a piece of the cricket foundation: he was a graduate of the elite Wesley College and the child of a previous Test selector. He had likewise come back to shape, taking 37ÃÂ wickets in the 1953Ã¢ÂÂ 54 Sheffield ShieldÃ¢ÂÂmore than some other playerÃ¢ÂÂat a normal of 16.37. In what cricket essayist Dick Whitington estimated was a vote part between the New South Wales and Victorian groups, the Australian Board of Control designated Johnson as Australian chief. His arrangement was not all around cheered.
