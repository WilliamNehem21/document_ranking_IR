Steiger showed up in three movies discharged in 1957. The first was John Farrow's film noir "The Unholy Wife", in which he played a well off Napa Valley vintner who weds a "femme fatale" named Phyllis (Diana Dors). In its unique audit of the film, "The New York Times" portrayed Steiger's execution as "inquisitive" further expressing that the performing artist's voice balance "ranges from Marlon Brando to Ronald Colman and back." During the creation of Samuel Fuller's "Keep running of the Arrow", in which he played a confederate veteran who won't acknowledge rout following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox toward the finish of the American Civil War, Steiger gravely sprained his lower leg before shooting one of the fight scenes and was unfit to walk, not to mention run. Fuller rather got one of the Native American additional items to keep running in Steiger's place, which is the reason the scene was shot indicating just the feet, rather than utilizing close-ups. Steiger had inquired about the history behind the film and chose to play the character as an Irishman, turning into "the principal Irish cowhand" as he put it. Soon thereafter, Steiger played the lead job in the British spine chiller "Over the Bridge", in which he played a German conman with British citizenship who seeks refuge in Mexico in the wake of stealing organization reserves. Film commentator Dennis Schwartz expressed that Steiger gave "one of his most noteworthy exhibitions".
