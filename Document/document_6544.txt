M.I.A. selected to sing, rather than rap, on a few tracks on the collection, telling "Moving Stone" in mid 2010 that she wished to deliver something other than what's expected from her past collection, which had "more accentuation on creation". In a January 2010 meeting with "NME" she talked about being roused by the film "Sustenance, Inc." and portrayed the collection as being tied in with "investigating our deficiencies and defects" and being glad for them. The end track, "Space", which was supposedly recorded utilizing an iPhone application, is a number which Mikael Wood, writing in "Bulletin", portrayed as "fantastic" and "sound[ing] like a Sega Genesis rehearsing its cushion talk". Conversely, Greg Kot of the "Chicago Tribune" portrayed "Lovalot" as sounding "like it was recorded in a wet back street, the vocalist's voice resounding in the midst of percussion that sounds like entryways squeaking and rodents hurrying crosswise over waste jars". "XXXO" draws its motivation from M.I.A's. "gooey pop side", and depends on the subject of the making of a sex image. "Teqkilla" is the main track to address her association with Bronfman, through a reference to Seagram, the organization claimed by his family. "It Takes a Muscle" is a spread variant of a track initially recorded in 1982 by Dutch gathering Spectral Display, and is performed in a reggae style.
