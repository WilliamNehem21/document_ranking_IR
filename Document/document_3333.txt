In a meeting with "Non mainstream Journal", Joseph said that when composing music he likes to focus on the tune first, expressing, "Essentially, I compose from a two-man outlook. To begin with, I let the tune grab hold and I put down the thought as a crude passionate articulation. At that point I let it inhale and return, drawing closer from a greater amount of a target perspective. This enables me to rediscover the genuine significance I proposed first and foremost, revealing new insight into how I can best speak to that to the audience." This equivalent idea is clarified again in a taped meeting with the "Administration Television Network" with Joseph clarifying that a great deal of times he may just think of part of a song. At that point he would give it a chance to rest and return to it and check whether it feels right. At that point he would begin "working around it", like assembling a vehicle - begin with a casing and after that begin building things around it. Musically, he attempts to interface a typical extension between such invigorating sentiments as performing at the Acropolis, to the feelings every single one feels each day. "At last, a great tune will dependably stand the trial of time", says Joseph.
