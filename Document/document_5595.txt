Paleo-Indian nearness in what is presently Grand Teton National Park goes back over 11,000 years. Jackson Hole valley atmosphere around then was colder and more snow capped than the semi-parched atmosphere discovered today, and the primary people were transitory seeker gatherers spending summer a very long time in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range. Along the shores of Jackson Lake, fire pits, apparatuses and what are thought to have been angling loads have been found. One of the devices found is of a sort related with the Clovis culture, and devices from this social period go back in any event 11,500ÃÂ years. A portion of the apparatuses are made of obsidian which concoction investigation shows originated from sources close present-day Teton Pass, south of Grand Teton National Park. In spite of the fact that obsidian was likewise accessible north of Jackson Hole, essentially all the obsidian skewer focuses found are from a source toward the south, showing that the fundamental regular transitory course for the Paleo-Indian was from this bearing. Elk, which winter on the National Elk Refuge at the southern end of Jackson Hole and northwest into higher elevations amid spring and summer, pursue a comparative transient example right up 'til the present time. From 11,000 to about 500ÃÂ years back, there is little proof of progress in the transient examples among the Native American gatherings in the locale and no proof that shows any perpetual human settlement.
