Appalachian State had routinely planned FBS groups, playing against schools, for example, Auburn in 1999, Kansas and LSU in 2005, and NC State in 2006. They likewise had recreations against Wake Forest in each season from 1979 to 1996, just as in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these diversions, every one of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten a FBS group since 2000. Michigan, a notable school football control with a huge fan base, had never played a FCS group. As indicated by Appalachian State athletic chief Charlie Cobb, the two schools had holes in their timetable as late as February 2007; the fellowship between Mountaineers mentor Jerry Moore and Wolverines mentor Lloyd Carr assumed a key job in finishing the arrangement. While endeavoring to decide the measure of cash Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, arrangements between the two schools achieved a stop. Moore went to class authorities and encouraged them to acknowledge any offer Michigan gave them; he disclosed to them that "It's an open door diversion. It'll be a one-shot, unique arrangement to go up there and play. It's a mind boggling condition." Appalachian State at last settled on a $400,000 installment as a byproduct of playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season.
