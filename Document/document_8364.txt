All through this period, Hubbard was vigorously associated with coordinating the exercises of the Guardian's Office (GO), the lawful authority/knowledge office that he had built up in 1966. He trusted that Scientology was being assaulted by a global Nazi connivance, which he named the "Tenyaka Memorial", through a system of medication organizations, banks and therapists in an offer to assume control over the world. In 1973, he actuated the "Snow White Program" and coordinated the GO to expel negative reports about Scientology from government scrapes and track down their sources. The GO was requested to "get all false and mystery documents on Scientology, LRH ÃÂ ... that can't be acquired legitimately, by every single imaginable line of approachÃÂ ... i.e., work infiltration, janitor entrance, appropriate appearances using covers." His association in the GO's activities was disguised using codenames. The GO did undercover crusades for his benefit, for example, Operation Bulldozer Leak, planned "to adequately spread the gossip that will lead Government, media, and individual <nowiki>[</nowiki>Suppressive Persons<nowiki>]</nowiki> to infer that LRH has no control of the C of S and no lawful risk for Church action". He was kept educated of GO activities, for example, the burglary of medicinal records from an emergency clinic, provocation of therapists and invasions of associations that had been incredulous of Scientology at different occasions, for example, the Better Business Bureau, the American Medical Association, and American Psychiatric Association.
