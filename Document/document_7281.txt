The PetÃÂ©n marshes are shaped by a thickly forested low-lying limestone plain highlighting karstic geology. The territory is crossed by low eastÃ¢ÂÂ west arranged edges of Cenozoic limestone and is described by an assortment of backwoods and soil types; water sources incorporate commonly little waterways and low-lying occasional marshes known as "bajos". A chain of fourteen lakes keeps running over the focal waste bowl of PetÃÂ©n; amid the stormy season a portion of these lakes become interconnected. This waste territory measures around eastÃ¢ÂÂ west by northÃ¢ÂÂ south. The biggest lake will be Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡, close to the focal point of the waste bowl; it quantifies . A wide savannah expands south of the focal lakes; it has a normal height of above mean ocean level with karstic edges achieving a normal elevation of . The savannah includes a reduced red earth soil that is too poor to even think about supporting substantial development, which brought about a moderately low dimension of pre-Columbian occupation. It is encompassed by slopes with abnormally soak southern slants and gentler northern methodologies; the slopes are secured with thick tropical woodland. Toward the north of the lakes area "bajos" become increasingly visit, scattered with woods. In the furthest north of PetÃÂ©n the Mirador Basin frames another inside waste locale. Toward the south PetÃÂ©n achieves a height of around as it ascends towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets Paleozoic changeable rocks.
