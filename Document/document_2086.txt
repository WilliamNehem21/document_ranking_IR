The monetary circumstance had kept on declining, coming about that month in banks suspending specie installmentsÃ¢ÂÂthat is, they would not reclaim their banknotes for gold. Gold started to vanish from dissemination. With the 500,000 officers in the field, the legislature was spending the then-unbelievable aggregate of $2 million every day. Sherman comprehended that "an extreme change in existing laws identifying with our money must be made, orÃÂ ... the demolition of the Union would be unavoidableÃÂ ..." Secretary Chase concurred and suggested that the Treasury Department issue United States Notes that were redeemable not in specie but rather in 6% government bonds. The bills would be "legitimate cash and a lawful delicate in the installment everything being equal". Only gold and silver coin had ever been legitimate delicate in the United States, however Congress respected the wartime necessities, and the subsequent First Legal Tender Act passed both the House and the Senate. The Act restricted the notes (later known as "greenbacks") to $150 million, however two resulting Legal Tender Acts that year extended the breaking point to $450 million. Making paper cash legitimate delicate was disputable, and William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, executive of the Senate Finance Committee, was among numerous who restricted the proposition. Sherman differ and talked for the thought. He protected his situation as fundamental in his journals, saying "from the section of the lawful delicate act, by which implies were accommodated using the abundance of the nation in the concealment of the defiance, the tide of war turned to support us".
