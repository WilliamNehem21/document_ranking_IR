Following quite a while of wrangling between the central government and Herbert Greenfield's Alberta governmentÃ¢ÂÂwrangling in which Brownlee, as Greenfield's lawyer general, assumed a noteworthy jobÃ¢ÂÂit at first created the impression that the exchange was settled upon: Brownlee met with King in Ottawa in January 1926 and consented to the arrangement (subject to endorsement by the administrative Parliament and the Legislative Assembly of Alberta). Be that as it may, the following month government attorney O. M. Biggar came to Edmonton to examine minor changes to the understanding. One of these progressions was a prerequisite that Alberta regulate school lands and the school lands finance "for the help of schools sorted out and continued in that, as per the arrangements of Section 17 of the Alberta Act". Understanding this to mean just that the region would be required to utilize the school lands reserve to help schoolsÃ¢ÂÂa recommendation to which Brownlee had no protestÃ¢ÂÂhe concurred. It before long developed that what was really expected was that Alberta keep on supporting separate Roman Catholic schools. Brownlee protested this, less from any complaint to financing Catholic schools than on the rule that training involved common locale, however King would not enable him to cancel his understanding. Truth be told, the change had been made at the induction of Ernest Lapointe, King's Quebec lieutenant, who needed to assuage Quebec patriot pioneer Henri Bourassa, and in Tim Byrne's sentiment "was clearly a political move that had little to do with the understanding". Brownlee countered by putting an altered variant of the consent to his governing body, one that supplanted the culpable language with "sorted out as per the laws of the Province". It passed collectively.
