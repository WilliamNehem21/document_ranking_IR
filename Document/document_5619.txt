Vrba affirmed in January 1985, alongside Raul Hilberg, at the seven-week preliminary in Toronto of German Holocaust denier Ernst ZÃÂ¼ndel, which finished with ZÃÂ¼ndel's conviction for purposely distributing false material about the Holocaust. (In "R v Zundel" (1992), the Supreme Court of Canada maintained Zundel's allure on free-discourse grounds.) During the preliminary, ZÃÂ¼ndel's legal advisor, Doug Christie, attempted to undermine Vrba (and three different survivors) by mentioning perpetually nitty gritty depictions, at that point exhibiting any error as critical. As per Lawrence Douglas, when Vrba said he had watched bodies consume in a pit, Christie asked how profound the pit had been; when Vrba portrayed a SS officer climbing onto the top of a gas chamber, Christie got some information about the tallness and edge. At the point when Vrba revealed to Christie he was not willing to talk about his book except if the jury had perused it, the judge quickly rectified him: "Dr. Vrba, you are not to give arranges concerning what this jury will do and what you will do or not do." Christie likewise contended that Vrba's information of the gas chambers was used. As per Vrba's testimony for Adolf Eichmann's preliminary in 1961, he got data about the gas chambers and crematoria from "Sonderkommando" Filip MÃÂ¼ller and other people who worked there, something that MÃÂ¼ller affirmed in 1979. Christie asked whether he had seen anybody gassed. Vrba answered that he had watched individuals being taken into the structures and had seen SS officers toss in gas canisters after them: "Hence, I finished up it was anything but a kitchen or a pastry shop, however it was a gas chamber. It is conceivable they are still there or that there is a passage and they are presently in China. Else, they were gassed."
