The waterway has endured a few noteworthy ruptures since its commencement. As right on time as 1799 a flood diverted expansive areas of the lower banks, and on 15 October 1853 two water crafts were cleared through a rupture close to the base of Nob End Locks (no wounds were accounted for). Three breaks were accounted for from 1878Ã¢ÂÂ 1879, in Little Lever and Darcy Lever, the last close Burnden Chemical Works. Subsidence, brought about by mining movement, provoked a rupture close Agecroft in 1881. Because of such episodes, from 1881 to 1888 designer Edwin Muir was utilized to decrease the subsidence brought about by mining action. Comparative work was attempted all through the 1920s. Maps from the 1880s demonstrate that by at that point, to shield against further subsidence, the waterway organization had obtained zones of coal underneath the channel. In 1884 the waterway's proprietors, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, effectively sued colliery proprietors Knowles and Sons for misfortunes acquired from harm brought about by subsidence. Following this judgment, the railroad organization settled out of court with other colliery proprietors. Steady fixes were made, especially through Pendleton, where the bank was intermittently raised. A few extensions were lifted far over their unique backings, while others sank as low as above head stature.
