The idea of government under the Angevin rulers was badly characterized and dubious. John's ancestors had ruled utilizing the guideline of "vis et voluntas", or "compel and will", taking official and once in a while self-assertive choices, regularly legitimized on the premise that a lord was exempt from the rules that everyone else follows. Both Henry II and Richard had contended that rulers had a nature of "divine grandness"; John proceeded with this pattern and guaranteed a "practically royal status" for himself as ruler. Amid the twelfth century, there were opposite assessments communicated about the idea of sovereignty, and numerous contemporary scholars trusted that rulers should run as per the custom and the law, and consult the main individuals from the domain. There was up 'til now no model for what ought to occur if a lord wouldn't do as such. Notwithstanding his case to one of a kind expert inside England, John would here and there legitimize his activities on the premise that he had taken committee with the noblemen. Present day students of history stay separated with respect to whether John experienced an instance of "regal schizophrenia" in his way to deal with government, or if his activities simply mirrored the mind boggling model of Angevin majesty in the mid thirteenth century.
