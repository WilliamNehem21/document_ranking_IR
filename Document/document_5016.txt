Lekson and McKenna note that following the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl in the mid nineteenth century, the structure's "pace of disintegration expanded alarminglyÃÂ ... [it] has decayed at a quicker rate in the course of the only remaining century and a half than in the past six." Chetro Ketl's wooden components have demonstrated particularly defenseless in a locale that needs timber, with fighters, cattlemen, and homeless people rummaging them from the structure. The back gallery was available in 1901, yet by 1921 the bars had been expelled by individuals scouring the gulch for wood. The way toward revealing pillars amid exhuming has additionally hurried their decay. Chaco Wash, which extends and enlarges amid summer downpour showers, additionally undermines the gulch's remnants. The once conspicuous decline hill has been everything except annihilated by continued digging and by redirecting arroyos close Chetro Ketl. Fortune chasing, domesticated animals touching, and early National Park Service adjustment endeavors additionally added to the corruption of the structure, as have profound unearthings that left Chaco Wash inclined to flooding. Prehistoric studies was in charge of the disastrous impacts of a 1947 flood that crushed the dividers of twenty rooms and crumbled of the north divider. It likewise toppled Chetro Ketl's tallest remainders.
