Among driving melodic figures at the debut were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-SaÃÂ«ns, and Charles Gounod. GeneviÃÂ¨ve, experiencing a canker in her correct eye, was unfit to be available. The musical show's first execution reached out to four-and-a-half hours; the last demonstration did not start until after 12 pm. Thereafter, Massenet and Saint-SaÃÂ«ns were salutary, Gounod less so. As indicated by one record, he blamed Bizet for counterfeiting: "Georges has ransacked me! Take the Spanish pretense and mine out of the score and there remains nothing shockingly except for the sauce that covers the fish". A significant part of the press remark was negative, communicating horror that the champion was an irreverent temptress as opposed to a lady of temperance. Galli-MariÃÂ©'s execution was portrayed by one pundit as "the very manifestation of bad habit". Others whined of an absence of tune and made horrible correlations with the conventional OpÃÂ©ra-Comique charge of Auber and Boieldieu. LÃÂ©on Escudier in "L'Art Musical" called the music "dull and obscureÃÂ ... the ear becomes exhausted of hanging tight for the rhythm that never comes". There was, be that as it may, acclaim from the artist ThÃÂ©odore de Banville, who cheered Bizet for giving a dramatization genuine people rather than the typical OpÃÂ©ra-Comique "manikins". The open's response was tepid, and Bizet before long wound up persuaded of its disappointment: "I predict an unmistakable and sad failure".
