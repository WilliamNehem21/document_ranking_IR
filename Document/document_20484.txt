In 738 the interlinked fortunes of QuiriguÃ¡ and CopÃ¡n took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of QuiriguÃ¡, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of CopÃ¡n, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed him on his throne in 725. This coup does not seem to have affected either CopÃ¡n or QuiriguÃ¡ physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. QuiriguÃ¡ seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at QuiriguÃ¡, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when QuiriguÃ¡ seized and burned the wooden images of CopÃ¡n's patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of CopÃ¡n was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his QuiriguÃ¡ warriors.
