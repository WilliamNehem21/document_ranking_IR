"The Washington Post" covered July 30, 1916 that the gold dollars had been discharged and were being "ate up as gifts". By the by, as indicated by Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, "the Committee in control clearly understood that the quantity of authorities in the nation couldn't and would not ingest an issue of 100,000 mint pieces at $3.00 each" and somewhere in the range of 10,000 currencies "were discarded at an enormously scaled down cost to the 'Texas Dealer' [that is, himself] who thusly disseminated them widely among gatherers of the nation at a discounted cost". A sum of 10,023 were returned by the Committee to the Mint for softening. It is questionable what number of every year were liquefied, as the Mint did not track this. Mehl evaluated that the Committee sold 15,000 of the 1916 and 5,000 of the 1917 (counting the deal to him), implying that around 5,000 of each were liquefied. Arbors regarded these figures "likely right", given Mehl's own dealings with the Committee. Nooks determined that 8,000 of the 1916 were sold by the Committee to gatherers and the general population, in addition to 7,000 to Mehl. He opined that 2,000 of the 1917 were sold by the Committee at the maximum, in addition to 3,000 to Mehl. Swiatek, in his 2012 book on commemoratives, assessed that between a third and half of the softened pieces were dated 1917.
