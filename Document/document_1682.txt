The Basic Design Section of the Navy Technical Department settled on an amplified and improved "HiryÃÂ«" plan with the island on the port side, amidships. After development of the boats started, the Naval Air Technical Department (NATD) started having misgivings about the area of the island since it suspected that the portside area of the island on "HiryÃÂ«" and "Akagi" adversy affected wind stream over the flight deck. Another issue recognized was that the amidships position abbreviated the accessible landing territory, which could be tricky later on as flying machine landing speeds expanded with their developing weight. To confirm these presumptions, the NATD shot several departures and arrivals on board "Akagi" in OctoberÃ¢ÂÂ November 1938 and chose to move the island over to the starboard side and further forward, around 33% of the length from the bow. "ShÃÂkaku" was the uttermost progressed by this point and the supporting structure for the extension had just been manufactured; reconstructing it would have deferred development so it was left set up. The progressions that must be made comprised of a broadening of the flight deck inverse the island and a comparing narrowing on the starboard side and the expansion of counterbalance on the port side to re-balance the ship.
