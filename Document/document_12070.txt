The red wattlebird is transcendently a nectar-feeder, scavenging for the most part in trees, specifically moving along branches (instead of the storage compartment) and at blossom heads, and testing blooms with its bill. One examination in Bondi State Forest in southern New South Wales uncovered that the species searched at a stature of . They only here and there search for sustenance on the ground, however do as such to benefit from bushes, for example, the felines paw ("Anigozanthos humilis"). The red wattlebird organizes visiting blooms that produce a great deal of nectar, for example, those of eucalypts, banksias, grasstrees ("Xanthorrhoea") and emu hedges ("Eremophila"). It regularly lean towards plants with simple access to nectar instead of those with rounded blossoms (and subsequently hard to-get to nectar). The red wattlebird searches out yellow bloom heads of holly-leaved ("Banksia ilicifolia"), which have a lot higher nectar content than the more develop red blossom heads. The species rummages substantially more regularly in local than intriguing plants, however the presented coral tree ("Erythrina") is well known. Notwithstanding nectar, it takes bugs and other little animals, for the most part by peddling, and furthermore berries and other natural product. A field examine in the Mount Lofty Ranges found that it invested twice as much energy benefiting from nectar contrasted with bugs.
