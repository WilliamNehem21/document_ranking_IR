The main skeleton, known as the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was uncovered in 1861 close Langenaltheim, Germany, and maybe given to neighborhood doctor Karl HÃÂ¤berlein as a byproduct of restorative administrations. He at that point sold it for ÃÂ£700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing the majority of its head and neck, it was depicted in 1863 by Richard Owen as "Archaeopteryx macrura", taking into account the likelihood it didn't have a place with indistinguishable animal varieties from the plume. In the consequent fourth release of his "On the Origin of Species", Charles Darwin depicted how a few creators had kept up "that the entire class of flying creatures came abruptly into reality amid the eocene time frame; however at this point we know, on the expert of teacher Owen, that a fowl positively lived amid the statement of the upper greensand; and still more as of late, that bizarre flying creature, the "Archaeopteryx", with a long reptile like tail, bearing a couple of quills on each joint, and with its wings outfitted with two free paws, has been found in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Scarcely any ongoing revelation indicates more coercively than this how little we up 'til now know about the previous occupants of the world."
