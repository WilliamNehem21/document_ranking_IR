Blaine entered the 1876 presidential battle as the top choice, yet his odds were very quickly hurt by the rise of an embarrassment. Bits of gossip had started to spread in February of that year that Blaine had been associated with an exchange with the Union Pacific Railroad in which the railroad had paid Blaine $64,000 for some Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad bonds he claimed, despite the fact that the bonds were about useless. Generally, the supposed exchange was exhibited as a hoax intended to reward Blaine. Blaine denied the charges, as did the Union Pacific's chiefs. Blaine guaranteed he never had any dealings with the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad but to buy securities at market cost, and that he had lost cash on the exchange. Democrats in the House of Representatives all things considered requested a Congressional examination. The declaration seemed to support Blaine's rendition of occasions until May 31, when James Mulligan, a Boston representative once in the past utilized by Blaine's brother by marriage, affirmed that the charges were valid, that he had masterminded the exchange, and that he had letters to demonstrate it. The letters finished with the cursing expression, "Compassionately consume this letter." When the examining advisory group recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan that night in his lodging. What unfolded between the men is hazy, however Blaine either obtained the letters or, as Mulligan told the board of trustees, grabbed them from Mulligan's hands and fled the room. In any occasion, Blaine had the letters and denied the advisory group's interest to turn them over.
