A report was written by the military district commander in Kragujevac, "Hauptmann" (Captain) Otto von Bischofhausen, immediately after the massacre. This report was addressed to BÃ¶hme, and was later tendered in evidence at the Subsequent Nuremberg trials. According to von Bischofhausen, in the late evening of 18Â October, all male Jews in Kragujevac, along with some communists, were arrested according to lists, totalling 70Â persons. As this constituted far too few hostages to meet the quota of 2,300, it was proposed to collect the balance by arrests on the streets, squares and houses of Kragujevac, in an operation to be conducted by III./749th Infantry Regiment, and I.Â Battalion of the 724th Infantry Regiment, part of the 704th Infantry Division. In response to this proposal, von Bischofhausen claimed that he suggested to the garrison commander, Major Paul KÃ¶nig, that, instead of using the population of Kragujevac, the required hostages be gathered from surrounding villages which were known to be "completely strewn with communists". According to von Bischofhausen's account, this suggestion was initially accepted by KÃ¶nig, and, on 19Â October, III./749th Infantry Regiment "mopped up" the villages of MeÄkovac and MarÅ¡iÄ, and I./724th Infantry Regiment conducted a similar operation in the villages of GroÅ¡nica and Milatovac. A total of 422Â men were shot in these four villages, without any German losses.
