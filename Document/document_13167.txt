Patton was ignored to lead the attack in northern Europe. In September, BradleyÃ¢ÂÂPatton's lesser in both position and experienceÃ¢ÂÂwas chosen to order the First United States Army that was framing in England to plan for Operation Overlord. As per Eisenhower, this choice had been made a very long time before the slapping episodes wound up open information, yet Patton felt they were the reason he was denied the order. Eisenhower had officially chosen Bradley since he felt the intrusion of Europe was too vital to even consider risking any vulnerability. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a heavenly corps-level battle officer, Bradley had two of the attributes that a theater-level vital order required, and that Patton prominently came up short on: a quiet, contemplated manner, and a carefully predictable nature. The slapping occurrences had just additionally affirmed to Eisenhower that Patton did not have the capacity to practice order and restraint at such a direction level. All things considered, Eisenhower re-stressed his trust in Patton's aptitude as a ground battle administrator by prescribing him for advancement to four-star general in a private letter to Marshall on 8 September, taking note of his past battle abuses and conceding that he had a "driving force" that Bradley needed.
