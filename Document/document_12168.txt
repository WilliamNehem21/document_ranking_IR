William stayed in England after his crowning celebration and attempted to accommodate the local magnates. The remaining earlsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton)ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ were affirmed in their territories and titles. Waltheof was hitched to William's niece Judith, little girl of Adelaide, and a marriage among Edwin and one of William's girls was proposed. Edgar the ÃÂtheling likewise seems to have been given terrains. Ministerial workplaces kept on being held by indistinguishable religious administrators from before the attack, including the uncanonical Stigand. Be that as it may, the groups of Harold and his siblings lost their territories, as did some other people who had battled against William at Hastings. By March, William was sufficiently secure to come back to Normandy, yet he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his stepbrother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, responsible for England alongside another persuasive supporter, William fitzOsbern, the child of his previous watchman. The two men were additionally named to earldomsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Despite the fact that he put two Normans in general charge, he held a large number of the local English sheriffs. Once in Normandy the new English lord went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, and after that went to the sanctification of new holy places at two Norman religious communities.
