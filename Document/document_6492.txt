Gregoras reports that 6,400 mounted force and 8,000 infantry fell in the fight, a similar number he gives for Walter's powers. As per Muntaner, 20,000 infantry were slaughtered and just two of the seven hundred knights endure the fight, Roger Deslaur and Boniface of Verona. Like the quantity of troops associated with the fight, these misfortunes are mysterious and presumably overstated, however they demonstrate the size of the Athenian thrashing. Both David Jacoby and Kenneth Setton have noticed that the similitudes between record of the fight in Muntaner and Gregoras and the depictions of the prior Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, where the Flemish infantry vanquished the French knights, down to the quantity of 700 knights killed "all with goads of gold", as guaranteed by Muntaner. Jacoby specifically considers the formation of a fake swamp to end the rangers charge as a perhaps created component in the two cases, to explain the astounding annihilation of French knights using a "slippery" trap. Some senior individuals from the Frankish respectability are known to have endure: Nicholas Sanudo, later Duke of the Archipelago, figured out how to get away, and a couple of others, for example, Antoine le Flamenc, who is known to have taken an interest in and endure the fight, were most likely caught and later delivered. Walter's head was separated by the Catalans and numerous years after the fact was taken to Lecce, in Italy, where his child Walter VI covered him in the Church of Santa Croce.
