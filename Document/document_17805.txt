As financial losses mounted, the B&O finally ceded the New YorkâWashington market to the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday, April 26, 1958, and bringing the venerable "Royal Blue" to an end. As the engineer was about to ease the locomotive's throttle open for the "Royal Blue's" final departure from Washington Union Station at 3:45Â p.m., the event was covered in a trainside remote broadcast by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network "See It Now" television special. The train's 7:49Â p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from "The New York Times", the "New York Post", "Life" magazine and "The Saturday Evening Post", on hand to cover the legendary "Royal Blue"'s demise. In an editorial the next day, the "Baltimore Sun" lamented the end of the "Royal Blue", saying it "may have been one of the most famous named trains in history". "The New York Times", in a front page article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7-year old passenger, said "It was a sad and simple story yesterday as the nation's oldest railroad discontinued its crack "Royal Blue" and its five other passenger trainsÂ ...Â end[ing] sixty-eight years of continuous through service, operated in a gentlemanly fashionÂ ...Â a kind of ante-bellum, gracious way of lifeÂ ...Â and the reputation for very special service."
