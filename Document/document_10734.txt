"No Surprises", recorded in a solitary take, is organized with electric guitar (motivated by the Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band endeavored to repeat the state of mind of Louis Armstrong's 1968 chronicle of "What a Wonderful World" and the spirit music of Marvin Gaye. Planning to accomplish a slower beat than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the tune at a quicker rhythm, at that point moderated the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, making an "ethereal" impact. Yorke recognized the subject of the tune as "somebody who's making a decent attempt to keep it together yet can't". The verses appear to depict a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and disappointment with contemporary social and political request. A few lines allude to provincial or rural symbolism. One of the key analogies in the melody is the opening line, "a heart that is full up like a landfill"; as indicated by Yorke, the tune is a "messed up nursery rhyme" that "originates from my unfortunate fixation of how to manage plastic boxes and plastic bottlesÃÂ ... So much stuff is getting covered, the flotsam and jetsam of our lives. It doesn't spoil, it just remains there. That is the manner by which we bargain, that is the way I manage stuff, I cover it." The tune's delicate state of mind stands out strongly from its brutal verses; Steele stated, "notwithstanding when the subject is suicideÃÂ ... O'Brien's guitar is as calming as analgesic on a red-crude mind, the melody rendered like a mixed youngster's petition."
