Stephens set "D.ÃÂ regia" in area "Psychophila" Planch., which around then included "D.ÃÂ arcturi", "D.ÃÂ stenopetala", and "D.ÃÂ uniflora", however she noticed that the many-blossomed inflorescence was bizarre for this gathering. In 1970, the South African botanist Anna Amelia Obermeyer recommended that "D.ÃÂ regia" did not fit into any of the scientific categorizations set up by Ludwig Diels in his 1906 monograph on the family. Obermeyer noticed the uncommon attributes that set "D.ÃÂ regia" aside from some other "Drosera" species: the operculate dust, circinate leaf vernation, unified styles, and woody rhizomes. In 1994, RÃÂ¼diger Seine and Wilhelm Barthlott proposed ordering "D.ÃÂ regia" as the sole species in another subgenus, "Drosera" subg. "Regiae", to "give sufficient acknowledgment to the separated position of "D.ÃÂ regia" inside the class." This ordered position was attested by Jan Schlauer in his dichotomous key and ordered corrections distributed in 1996. Likewise in 1996 two Czech analysts, JindÃÂich Chrtek and ZdeÃÂka SlavÃÂ­kovÃÂ¡, proposed changes to the scientific classification of the variety by part "D.ÃÂ regia" off into its own, monotypic sort, "Freatulina". Chrtek and SlavÃÂ­kovÃÂ¡ refered to the numerous morphological contrasts among "D.ÃÂ regia" and each other individual from the family "Drosera" in help of their choice to make this ordered split. They reaffirmed their ordered feelings in a 1999 article that additionally split the tuberous "Drosera", individuals from the subgenus "Ergaleium", to Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's revived sort "Sondera". These ordered amendments, in any case, have not increased any help, being rejected or to a great extent disregarded by late productions on the sort.
