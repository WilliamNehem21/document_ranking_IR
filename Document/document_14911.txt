Lee found that rather than Chinese film, he needed to deter huge numbers of the on-screen characters from utilizing an "exceptionally stagy, extremely English convention. Rather than simply being watched like an individual and getting compassion, they believe they need to get things done, they need to convey the film." Grant specifically regularly must be limited from giving a "ridiculous" execution; Lee later reviewed that the performing artist is "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I need to state, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thingÃÂ ... also, not [let] the motion picture serve him, which is presumably what he's utilized to now." For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson discovered motivation from her response to her dad's passing. Give had been unconscious that Thompson would cry through a large portion of his discourse, and the on-screen character endeavored to console him, "'There's no other way, and I guarantee you it'll work, and it will be amusing just as being contacting.' And he stated, 'Goodness, OK,' and he was great about it". Lee had one interest for the scene, that Thompson maintain a strategic distance from the impulse to turn her head towards the camera.
