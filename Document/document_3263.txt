In 1923, "Braunschweig"s connect was modified and developed. The ship's program pursued a similar example as the earlier year, with visits to remote ports in July; "Braunschweig" ceased in Helsinki, Finland, and Gothenburg, Sweden, amid her excursion. Joint moves were held again in August and September, after which PÃÂ¼llen left the ship. On 15 October, "VAdm" Hans Zenker, at that point the "Oberbefehlshaber der SeestreitkrÃÂ¤fte" ("O.d.S"Ã¢ÂÂ Commander of Naval Forces), redesigned the armada structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic directions and supplanting them with associations dependent on ship type. "Braunschweig" was presently relegated to the "Linienschiffsdivision" (Battleship Division), where she filled in as Zenker's lead. The division likewise incorporated the warship "Hannover". In February and March 1924, the ship filled in as an icebreaker in the Baltic. The typical journey abroad in July 1924 wandered more remote than in earlier years, with a stumble into the Atlantic. "Braunschweig" halted in A CoruÃÂ±a from 6 to 13 July. Armada moves pursued toward the finish of August, and at their decision, the armada tied down off Sassnitz for a maritime audit for "Naval commander" Paul Behncke, the resigning "Cook der AdmiralitÃÂ¤t" (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was elevated to supplant Behncke, who was thus supplanted at this point "VAdm" Mommsen, who again made "Braunschweig" his leader. Further activities were held from 29 September to 5 October.
