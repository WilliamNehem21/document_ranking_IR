Opening in 2,362 performance centers on March 2, 2007, the film netted US$13.3 million in its opening end of the week, setting second and posting a for each venue normal of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by individual opener "Wild Hogs" and saw a decay of over half in its second end of the week, missing out to the record-breaking "300". It earned $33 million in North America and $51 million in the remainder of the world, bringing its present aggregate to $84 million. In a meeting with "Sight and Sound" magazine, Fincher tended to the film's low gross at the North American film industry: "Even with the movies being what it is, despite everything I believe there's a crowd of people out there for this motion picture. Everybody has an alternate thought regarding advertising, yet my theory is that in the event that you showcase a film to 16-year-old young men and don't convey "Saw" or "Seven", they will be the most vociferous ones leaving the screening saying 'This motion picture sucks.' And you're bidding a fond farewell to the crowd who might get it since they're going to take a gander at the promotions and state, 'I would prefer not to see some slasher motion picture.'"
