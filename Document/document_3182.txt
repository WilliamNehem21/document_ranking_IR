At the point when Goldsmith took over as manager, there was some worry at Ziff Davis that she probably won't most likely handle the activity. An expert, Norman Lobsenz, was gotten to support her; Lobsenz's title was "publication chief", however in certainty Goldsmith made the story determinations. Lobsenz gave blurbs and articles, read the accounts Goldsmith purchased, and met with Goldsmith consistently. Goldsmith was not a long-term sf peruser, and thought minimal about the field; she basically searched for good quality fiction and purchased what she preferred. In Mike Ashley's words, "the outcome, somewhere in the range of 1961 and 1964, was the two most energizing and unique magazines in the field". New scholars whose first story showed up in "Fabulous" amid this period included Phyllis Gotlieb, Larry Eisenberg, Ursula K. Le Guin, Thomas M. Disch, and Piers Anthony. The November 1959 issue was committed to Fritz Leiber; it included "Lean Times in Lankhmar", one of Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. Goldsmith distributed another about six stories in the arrangement throughout the following six years, alongside other comparable (and here and there imitative) fiction, for example, early work by Michael Moorcock, and John Jakes' initial accounts of Brak the Barbarian. This fortified the beginning sword and witchcraft subgenre. Goldsmith got an early story by Cordwainer Smith, "The Fife of Bodidharma", which kept running in the June 1959 issue, however presently Pohl at "World" achieved a consent to get first refusal on the entirety of Smith's work.
