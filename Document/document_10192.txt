The White-necked rockfowl breeds essentially in caverns and matches home either alone or as a major aspect of a little state. While its romance conduct is obscure, the species is monogamous and subsequently does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate regardless of prior recommendations that it reproduced agreeably. The White-necked rockfowl has two reproducing seasons consistently, however the planning of the rearing seasons is dictated by the area of the winged animals and the planning of the wet season, with settling happening just when the wet season and averaging 127 days separated. The rockfowl reuses its home, and regularly fixes it two to about two months preceding laying eggs. Guinean winged animals breed from July to January, while those in Sierra Leone breed from November to February and from April to October. In Liberia, rearing happens from September to December and from March to July. Ghana's rockfowl breed from March to June and September to November. Rearing caverns are generally abandoned while the rockfowl are not reproducing, so expanded use by the rockfowl is viewed as a first indication of rearing. Settling settlements normal two to five homes, albeit one state had forty homes. Notwithstanding reproducing fowls, some of the time non-rearing rockfowl are available. These winged creatures every so often endeavor child murder to access prime settling locales or mates. Feathered creatures in these states frequently pursue each other in circles, even through the treetops, an uncommon goal for this species.
