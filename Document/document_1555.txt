"Bird of prey" lifted off the Moon at 17:11:22 GMT on August 2 following 66 hours and 55 minutes on the lunar surface. Docking with the CSM occurred just shy of two hours after the fact. After the space travelers exchanged examples and different things from the LM to the CSM, the LM was closed, casted off, and purposefully collided with the lunar surface, an effect enrolled by the seismometers left by Apollo 12, 14 and 15. The cast off demonstrated troublesome in view of issues getting impenetrable seals, requiring a deferral in disposing of the LM. After the cast off, Slayton went ahead the circle to suggest that the space explorers take dozing pills, or if nothing else that Scott and Irwin do as such. Scott as mission administrator wouldn't permit it, feeling there was no need. Amid the EVAs, the specialists had seen inconsistencies in the pulses of both Scott and Irwin, of which the group was not educated amid the flight. Irwin had heart issues in the wake of resigning as a space explorer and kicked the bucket in 1991 of a heart assault; Scott felt that he as leader ought to have been educated of the biomedical readings. NASA specialists at the time hypothesized the heart readings were because of potassium lack, because of their diligent work superficially and deficient resupply through fluids.
