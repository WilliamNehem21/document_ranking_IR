Albania remained occupied by Italy until its surrender to the Allies in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of "Generaloberst" Lothar Rendulic's 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-"BrigadefÃ¼hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei" Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the "Balli KombÃ«tar", an anti-communist and nationalist militia. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the SandÅ¾ak region were recruited into the 13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian), a "Waffen-SS" division composed largely of Bosnian Muslims and Croats with mostly German officers, that operated in the puppet Independent State of Croatia (). A key recruiter amongst Albanians for the "Waffen-SS" was "SS-StandartenfÃ¼hrer" Karl von Krempler. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the SandÅ¾ak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the SandÅ¾ak.
