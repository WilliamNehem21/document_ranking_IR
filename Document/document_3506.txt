The focal subject in practically all versions of the story supporting the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's wellbeing. From July 1858 onwards it was accounted for crosswise over Europe that because of her sadness, Edgardo's mom had basically if not really gone crazy, and may even kick the bucket. The ground-breaking picture of the grief stricken mother was focused vigorously in the family's interests both to people in general and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish people group, Sabatino Scazzocchio, disclosed to Edgardo that his mom's life was in danger on the off chance that he didn't return soon. At the point when Marianna kept in touch with her child in August, Scazzocchio wouldn't convey the letter in light of the fact that, being moderately quiet and consoling in tone, it may neutralize the impression they were endeavoring to give him that she was never again herself and that just his arrival could spare her. One journalist detailed in January 1859: "The dad demonstrates a lot of mettle, yet the mother is experiencing serious difficulties conveying on.ÃÂ ... On the off chance that the Holy Father had seen this lady as I saw her, he would not have the strength to keep her child another minute."
