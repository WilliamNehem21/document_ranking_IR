Confusion with the highly regarded miller or sweetbread mushroom ("Clitopilus prunulus") is a common cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of "Entoloma sinuatum" can also be confused with St George's mushroom ("Calocybe gambosa"), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric ("Clitocybe nebularis"), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus "Tricholoma", although the spore colour (white in "Tricholoma", pinkish in "Entoloma") and shape (angular in "Entoloma") help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma ("T.Â columbetta") has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. "E.Â sinuatum" may be confused with "Clitocybe multiceps" in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom ("Agaricus campestris"), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species "E. albidum" resembles "E.Â sinuatum" but is likewise poisonous.
