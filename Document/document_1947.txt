In spite of the fact that Cobden's perspectives were more dynamic than those of the Liberal Party's standard, she remained an individual from the gathering, trusting that it remained the best political vehicle whereby her causes could be progressed. Different suffragists, including Anne Cobden Sanderson, took an alternate view, and adjusted themselves to communist developments. At the point when the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) started its activist crusade in 1905, Cobden abstained from cooperation in illicit activities, in spite of the fact that she stood up for her sister when Anne ended up one of the primary suffragists to be sent to jail, after a show outside Parliament in October 1906. On Anne's discharge a month later, Cobden and her significant other went to a festival meal at the Savoy Hotel, together with other WSPU detainees. Cobden drew nearer to the aggressor wing in 1907 when she embraced the WSPU's new magazine, "Votes in favor of Women". That year she facilitated an "At Home" meeting at which the WSPU pioneer Christabel Pankhurst was the central speaker. The WSPU was part when individuals who questioned the Pankhurst family's dictator authority framed themselves into the Women's Freedom League; Cobden did not join Anne in the breakaway development, in spite of the fact that she bolstered its related body, the Women's Tax Resistance League.
