The organic product collections of "L.ÃÂ echinatum" are wide by tall, and are generally circular, or pear-molded. The outside surface is packed with spines that might be up to long. As per Curtis Gates Lloyd, American examples have more thin spines than European ones. At first white and getting to be dull darker in development, the spines are frequently joined at the tips in gatherings of three or four. In this structure the puffballs take after oak seed tops of burr oak, with which they may promptly be confounded. The spines swamp off in age, uncovering a to some degree net-like or reticulated surface. The natural product body has a little base that is a grayish or purple-dark shading, and it might be joined to the developing surface by meager white strings (rhizomorphs). The inward substance of the puffball contain the gleba, a mass of spores and related spore-delivering cells. In youthful examples the gleba is white and firm, yet as the puffball ages, it turns yellowish and after that dark colored to purple-darker and fine. Develop examples build up a pore at the highest point of the organic product body through which spores are discharged when hit by falling raindrops.
