One of the conspicuous hotspots for "Waffen-SS" labor was the about 40,000 troops of the SS-TV regiments, which comprised of young people beneath induction age for the Wehrmacht, just as more established "Allgemeine-SS" reservists. These regiments were under Himmler's control, and were sent crosswise over German-involved Europe as political police, yet the security capacities they did were plainly inside the abilities of the Orpo. In late 1940, so as to guarantee that Himmler's directions were completed, Berger set up an extraordinary camp at Sennheim in involved Alsace, where non-Reich German enlisted people could be raised to physical models and ideologically taught before "Waffen-SS" preparing. This was an endeavor to address the worries of certain authorities about the nature of these volunteers, and their capacity to be incorporated into units made for the most part out of Reich Germans. Enlisted people sent to this camp included "Volksdeutsche" (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and Flemings. Berger likewise made a system of workplaces all through German-involved Europe to guarantee the welfare of the groups of such enlists, impact the nearby networks to help "Waffen-SS" selecting, and get ready potential volunteers for teaching. This system and its exercises was firmly opposed by the Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans ( or VoMi) the Nazi Party arm in charge of directing the ethnic German people group outside the Reich. Himmler, discontent with crafted by VoMi in supporting SS selecting, did not annul VoMi, he simply approved Berger to evade it.
