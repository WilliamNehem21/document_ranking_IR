A tribute out of appreciation for Iwata, perusing "This diversion is devoted to our wingman who fell in fight", was set toward the finish of the credits for "Star Fox Zero". Another hypothesized tribute shows up in the Nintendo Switch 2017 dispatch title "", a diversion being developed at the season of his passing. A non-playable character, who looks somewhat like Satoru Iwata, requests the player to go on Satori Mountain looking for the otherworldly Lord of the Mountain. Given the likeness among "Satori" and "Satoru" and the way that the Lord of the Mountain is viewed as a managing soul, the mission is believed to be a detailed tribute to Iwata. In September 2017, modders found that an imitated variant of the NES amusement "Golf", which Iwata customized, is incorporated into each Nintendo Switch comfort's firmware, and can be gotten to by moving the Joy-Con controllers also to how Iwata would move his hands in Nintendo Direct introductions when the framework clock is set to July 11, the day of his demise; this gave off an impression of being evacuated by Nintendo with a framework update issued soon thereafter. Inside "PokÃÂ©mon Ultra Sun" and "Ultra Moon", visiting the Game Freak working with PokÃÂ©mon exchanged from "PokÃÂ©mon Gold" and "Silver" has a non-player character relate how they were experiencing difficulty getting information onto the Game Boy Color amusement cards until they were helped by an "astounding person"; this recognizes Iwata's commitment to "Gold" and "Silver" that enabled them to incorporate the entire of the world from "PokÃÂ©mon Red" and "Blue" without trading off the span of the "Gold"/"Silver" world. Inside "", an every day challenge that happens on every December 6 (Iwata's birthday) utilizes an interesting symbol dependent on Iwata.
