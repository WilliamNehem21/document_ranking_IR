The majority of the neck vertebrae were packed sideways, particularly at the center of the neck. A peak (additionally named edge or bottom) ran longitudinally at the edge of the neck vertebrae (a component commonplace of elasmosaurids), obvious from the third to the fifty-fifth vertebrae, at the rear piece of the neck. This peak was situated at the center of the centrum in the front vertebrae, and at the upper portion of the centrum from the nineteenth vertebra and onwards. The peak would have served to stay the musculature of the neck. The centra varied fit as a fiddle contingent upon the situation of the vertebrae in the neck; that of the third vertebra was about as long as it was wide, however the centra turned out to be longer than expansive from the fourth vertebra and onwards. The centra turned out to be progressively lengthened at the center of the neck, however ended up shorter again at the back of the neck, with the length and expansiveness being about equivalent at the 61st vertebra, and those of the rearmost vertebrae being more extensive than long. The articular surfaces of the vertebrae in the front of the neck were wide oval, and decently extended, with adjusted, thickened edges, with a removal (or hole) at the upper and lower sides. Further back in the front piece of the neck, around the 25th vertebra, the lower edge of the articular aspects turned out to be progressively inward, and the feature formed like a quadrate with adjusted edges. By the 63rd vertebra, the articular aspect was additionally quadratic fit as a fiddle with adjusted edges, though the centra of the rearmost vertebrae had an expansive oval diagram.
