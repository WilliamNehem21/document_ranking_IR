An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan filled in as MCC president from 1967 to 1968. Amid his residency, the MCC was associated with contention over the non-choice of Basil D'Oliveira to visit South Africa. The South African government did not need D'Oliveira in the England group on the grounds of his shading. Gilligan, in his ability as MCC president, knew about this having seen a private letter which conveyed the unequivocal danger from the South African executive B. J. Vorster that the inevitable visit would be dropped if D'Oliveira were chosen. Nonetheless, he and the other people who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, individually the MCC treasurer and secretary, hushed up about this data. At the point when the English selectors met to pick the group, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were available to speak to the MCC. A BBC program in 2004 asserted that Gilligan compelled the selectors to forget D'Oliveira, however D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne recommends that Allen conveyed unquestionably more impact at the gathering. He composes of Gilligan's part in the issue: "It is inappropriate to make a lot of Gilligan's humiliating past. Given that presidents are designated for just a year, it was a solid president in reality who could force his identity on the perpetual MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a solid president." Initially D'Oliveira was let well enough alone for the group, however when a player pulled back with damage, the selectors included him as a substitution; the South African government banished D'Oliveira from participating and the MCC dropped the visit.
