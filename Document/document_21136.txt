On 22 April 1983 a press release from "Stern" announced the existence of the diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April. On hearing the news from "Stern", JÃ¤ckel stated that he was "extremely sceptical" about the diaries, while his fellow historian, Karl Dietrich Bracher of the University of Bonn also thought their legitimacy unlikely. Irving was receiving calls from international news companiesâthe BBC, "The Observer", "Newsweek", "Bild Zeitung"âand he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes. The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, also said that he could not believe the diaries were genuine. The following day "The Times" published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage the historian had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of "The Times", Charles Douglas-Home. The "Times" editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at "The Sunday Times", while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday paper thus remained oblivious of the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine.
