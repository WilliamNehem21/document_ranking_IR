Fixing was one of a few backstrokers who had slipped on the beginning territory prior in the meet, so Kerry chose to rub a sticky red substance onto the bottoms of his feet. The Soviet coordinators had given a floor covering following the episodes, bringing about Kerry leaving red impressions in the arena. Kerry opened in a period quicker than his exertion in the individual occasion, yet it was as yet two seconds slower than his own best. He completed his leg in 57.87ÃÂ s, leaving Australia in fourth spot. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead in the wake of posting a period of 56.81ÃÂ s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third spot. France was the last to achieve the 100ÃÂ m imprint, recording a period of 58.84ÃÂ s. Evans at that point swam an individual best of 63.01ÃÂ s, the quickest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63ÃÂ s. His leg moved Australia into second spot at the midway imprint, only 0.45ÃÂ s behind the hosts and generally a large portion of a second in front of the British and the Hungarians. The four driving groups had split away, leaving a two-second hole back to the fifth-put East Germans.
