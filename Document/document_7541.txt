The most difficult impacts successions occurred inside Spacedock; months were spent finishing the station's inside shots. The impacts team tried distinctive hopes to ensure the dock inside appeared to be properly huge. "We found the inside requested some level of barometrical fog, despite the fact that there most likely wouldn't be any in space," Farrar said. To make a marginally debased look, the team utilized blue shading gels for lights and shot through smoke for fill shots. They changed to dissemination channels for light goes, as utilizing smoke for longer shots would have required tedious smoke level observing. Because of contrast in the sizes of the dock and ship models, it was difficult to film the "Excelsior" and "Endeavor" inside the set. Opening the dock's space entryways was dangerous on the grounds that the lights enlightening within the dock from the outside must be avoided the camera to forestall focal point flares. Gigantic fans were utilized to keep gear cool and keep the lights from dissolving or twisting the dock's inside craftsmanship. The authenticity of the dock scenes was uplifted by no frills film of a cafeteria, with windows disregarding the dock inside. The cafeteria was a set worked at ILM and loaded up with 40ÃÂ extras before a bluescreen so the dock and "Venture" could be composited in later; matte artistic creations broadened the roof of the set.
