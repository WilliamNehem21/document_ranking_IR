Sarah Stegall recommended that the scene takes a shot at two separate layers. On the top-most shallow layer, it works as a by and large spoof, mirroring both the stylings of "The X-Files" just as "Cops". On the other layer, she takes note of that "it's a genuine take a gander at approval." Throughout the scene, Mulder is endeavoring to catch the beast on camera and open it to a national crowd. The majority of the observers to the beast work as inconsistent storytellers: a Hispanic lady with "a background marked by meds"; a dark, gay "Twit"; a whore with a medication issue; a "scared funeral home chaperon", and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall contends that these characters are from "the undesirable part of town" and would not be acknowledged, not to mention accepted, by "a peaceful, working class society". At last, the main dependable observer is the camera, however Stegall calls attention to that "the camera, suspiciously, never entirely figures out how to discover [the monster]." Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's greatest dread isn't finding the beast in charge of the homicides. To back this thought up, she calls attention to that in addition to the fact that Mulder fails to catch any proof of the paranormal, however he additionally flops before a live crowd on national TV.
