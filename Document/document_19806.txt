The nutritional components of "R.Â virescens" mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A sample of dried mushroom (100Â gÂ dw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates make up the bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (Âµg) of tocopherols (20.0Â Âµg alpha, 21.3Â Âµg beta, and 8.0Â Âµg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid pigment lycopene. There are 4.46Â g of organic acids per 100Â g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic acid (0.78Â g), malic acid (2.71Â g), citric acid (0.55Â g), and fumaric acid (0.23Â g). Mushrooms have 22.6Â mg/100Â gÂ dw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 15.8Â mg/100Â gÂ dw of cinnamic acid.
