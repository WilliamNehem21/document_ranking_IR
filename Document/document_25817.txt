BeyoncÃ©'s first live performance of "Halo" was at the NAACP Awards on February 12, 2009. Wearing a white gown, she sang the ballad while archival footage from the Civil Rights Movement was shown on many screens in the background. Brennan Williams of Entertainment Newswire wrote that BeyoncÃ©'s "breathtaking performance" showed why she received the 2009 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Female Artist. She also sang "Halo" on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on April 22, 2009, and on "The Today Show" the following day. The song was later added to the set list of her I Am... Tour in 2009â10, when it was performed during the concert's encore. After BeyoncÃ© finished her "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" performance, she sang "Halo". She initially sang the ballad on stage before descending to shake hands with everybody in the front rows. Deborah McAleese and Lauren Mulvenny of "The Belfast Telegraph" commented that the ballad "was sung with great passion". It was included on her CD/DVD live albums "I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas" and "I Am... World Tour" (2010). BeyoncÃ© performed "Halo" live, as the closing song at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, in front of an audience of more than 175,000. During the ITV special "A Night With BeyoncÃ©", which aired on December 4, 2011 in the UK, she sang the ballad to a selected crowd of fans.
