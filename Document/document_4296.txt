Canning's preliminary started at the Old Bailey on Monday 29 April 1754, proceeding on Wednesday 1ÃÂ May, 3Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ May, 6Ã¢ÂÂ 7ÃÂ May and finishing on 8ÃÂ MayÃ¢ÂÂa bizarrely long preliminary for the time. Amid jury choice the barrier questioned three potential legal hearers (considerably less than the Crown's 17ÃÂ objections) however were past the point where it is possible to contend the decision of foreman, it's identity, asserted, had openly called Canning "a LYING BÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ H, a CHEAT, or an IMPOSTER". Managing the court was the new Lord Mayor, Thomas Rawlinson (Crisp Gascoyne's successor Edward Ironside having kicked the bucket in office in November 1753), with Edward Clive (Justice of the Common Pleas), Heneage Legge (Baron of the Exchequer), William Moreton (Recorder of London), and Samuel Fludyer, council member. Canning was spoken to by three lawyers, George Nares, John Morton and a Mr Williams. Indicting was Gascoyne's child Bamber, Edward Willes and William Davy. After her prosecution was perused by the Clerk of Arraigns the narrative of Canning's alleged snatching and detainment was retold by Bamber Gascoyne. At that point Davy talked finally. He assaulted Canning's story and told how Squires and her family had gone through England with pirated merchandise to sell. He offered new proof to help Squires' plausible excuse and rubbished Canning's depiction of her jail, before scrutinizing her record of her break. He finished up with Virtue Hall's recantation of her prior declaration. Willes was the beside talk, picking over the disparities between the different records offered by Canning of her vanishing.
