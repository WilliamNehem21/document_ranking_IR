The first season premiered in the United States on Tuesday, October 3, 2000, from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm. Fox had to obtain agreements from its affiliates to broadcast past 10:00 pm, as most of them air local news programs at this time. In subsequent weeks the show aired from 9:00 pm till 10:00 pm Tuesdays. During its first season, the show was preempted on several occasions, including by the 2000 World Series, the Billboard Music Awards and coverage of the presidential election. The frequent preemptions became a running joke on the set. "Dark Angel's" scheduled air time put it in direct competition with "Angel" on The WB. Critics debated which of the similarly named shows would dominate the time-slot. Jonathon Storm from "Philadelphia Media Network" believed that "Dark Angel" would prove victorious, while Brad Adgate, a research director at "Horizon Media", predicted that "Dark Angel" would only initially take the lead in the ratings, as "Angel's" strong fanbase would prevail in the long run. Brad Turrell, executive vice-president of Network Communication for the "WB" conceded that the heavy promotion for "Dark Angel" would give it higher initial ratings at first but believed that as "Angel" was a "better show" it would not be affected long-term. Concerned that there might be confusion between the two shows, the "WB" took out a full page ad in "TV Guide", which read "There is only ONE. David Boreanaz is ANGEL." "Angel" won the time slot when Fox moved the broadcast time of "Dark Angel" to 8:00 pm on Fridays for its second season, where it preceded the new series "Pasadena".
