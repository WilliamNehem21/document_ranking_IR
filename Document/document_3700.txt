In 1894 there were some noteworthy changes to the Pillar's texture. The first section on the west side, whereby guests entered the platform by a trip of steps bringing them down underneath road level, was supplanted by another ground level passage on the south side, with an amazing yard. The entire landmark was encompassed by overwhelming iron railings. In the new century, in spite of the developing patriotism inside DublinÃ¢ÂÂ80 percent of the Corporation's councilors were patriots of some depictionÃ¢ÂÂthe column was generously adorned with banners and streamers to check the 1905 Trafalgar centennial. The changing political environment had for quite some time been motioned by the entry in Sackville Street of further landmarks, all celebrating particularly Irish legends, in what the student of history Yvonne Whelan portrays as rebellion of the British Government, a "challenge in stone". Between the 1860s and 1911, Nelson was joined by landmarks to Daniel O'Connell, William Smith O'Brien and Charles Stewart Parnell, just as Sir John Gray and the moderation campaigner Father Mathew. In the mean time, in 1861, following quite a while of development, the Wellington Monument in Dublin's Phoenix Park was finished, the establishment stone having been laid in 1817. This huge monolith, high and square at the base, respected Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington, Dublin-conceived and a previous Chief Secretary for Ireland. In contrast to the Pillar, Wellington's monolith has pulled in little contention and has not been the subject of physical assaults.
