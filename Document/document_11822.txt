In November 1921 Joseph sorted out the Morley powers to play out a huge scale show, praising the bicentenary of the congregation of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The content was by Laurence Housman and the music, coordinated by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the next year Joseph's expanding acknowledgment as an author was affirmed when her "Seven Two-Part Songs" were performed at a SWM show that included works by Ethel Smyth and other ladies arrangers. Two of Joseph's works, "A Hymn for Whitsuntide" and "A Festival Venite" were presented amid the 1922 Whitsun celebration at All Saints' congregation, Blackheath, with Holst directing. After the "Venite" debut Joseph composed gratefully to Holst: "Do you assume for one minute that some other conductor takes inconvenience that way? In the event that you do, you are very off-base". The "Venite" was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the "Spectator"s faultfinder thought it an "entirely eminent expansion to present day British music". In the midst of her compositional and different exercises, Joseph discovered time, in 1922, to sort out the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to coordinate a significant number of the challenge melodies. At the appointed time this celebration turned into an imperative yearly occasion in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams' 50th birthday celebration, Joseph sorted out a choir which gave an early-morning shock execution in the author's greenhouse of a tune she had written to check the event.
