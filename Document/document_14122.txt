While researching the VIN from a hub of the truck utilized in the blast and the leftovers of the tag, government operators had the capacity to connect the truck to a particular Ryder rental office in Junction City, Kansas. Utilizing a sketch made with the help of Eldon Elliot, proprietor of the office, the specialists had the capacity to ensnare McVeigh in the shelling. McVeigh was likewise distinguished by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who recalled that him leaving a vast yellow Ryder truck in the parcel; McVeigh had marked in under his genuine name at the motel, utilizing a location that coordinated the one on his fashioned permit and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Prior to marking his genuine name at the motel, McVeigh had utilized false names for his exchanges. In any case, McGown noted, "Individuals are so used to marking their very own name that when they go to sign a fake name, they quite often go to compose, and after that search up for a minute as though to recollect the new name they need to utilize. That is the thing that [McVeigh] did, and when he looked into I began conversing with him, and it tossed him."
