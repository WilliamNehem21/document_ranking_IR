As opposed to war over the far off and low-populace domain, the United States and Britain had arranged. Since the marking of the Treaty of 1818, the Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States. Past U.S. organizations had offered to separate the area along the 49th parallel, which was not worthy to Britain, as it had business interests along the Columbia River. England's favored segment was unsatisfactory to Polk, as it would have granted Puget Sound and all terrains north of the Columbia River to Britain, and Britain was reluctant to acknowledge the 49th parallel reached out to the Pacific, as it implied the whole opening to Puget Sound would be in American hands, secluding its settlements along the Fraser River. Edward Everett, President Tyler's diplomat to Great Britain, had casually proposed separating the domain at the 49th parallel with the key Vancouver Island conceded to the British, in this manner enabling an opening to the Pacific, however when the new British pastor in Washington, Richard Pakenham touched base in 1844 arranged to development, he found that numerous Americans wanted the whole region. Oregon had not been a noteworthy issue in the 1844 race, however the substantial inundation of pilgrims, for the most part American, to the Oregon Country in 1845, and the rising soul of expansionism in the United States as Texas and Oregon caught the open's eye, made an arrangement with Britain progressively critical. Numerous Democrats trusted that the United States should length across the nation, a theory depicted as Manifest Destiny.
