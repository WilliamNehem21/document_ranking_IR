The year 1959 was expertly heartbreaking for Hordern. He made an arrival to arrange at the Old Vic in Arthur Wing Pinero's "The Magistrate" in which he played Mr. Posket. The play was not especially fruitful and gotten blended audits: According to the creator and theater faultfinder J. P. Wearing, Hordern was miscast, while a correspondent for "The Stage", thought he gave a "persuading depiction". Wearing trusted that generally speaking the play was not "played energetically enough", while a commentator for "The Times" imagined that it had "sturdy dramatic quality". The job was pursued with a piece of Pastor Manders in "Phantoms" inverse Flora Robson. "The Sunday Times" distributed an apathetic notice, and thought Hordern's character had "an on edge air" about him. He got similarly basic notification when he made that big appearance to play the title character in "Macbeth", inverse Beatrix Lehmann. The press composed of Hordern's "unintended comic translation" while describing the abhorrent ruler: "A large portion of his time in front of an audience he recoiled like an American floor covering merchant in a lower leg length dark robe of fluffy candlewick" thought one commentator, who proceeded to state "he would make a vile Shylock, a startling Fagin. Be that as it may, this Thane of Cawdor would be panicked by Banquo's valet, don't worry about it Banquo's apparition."
