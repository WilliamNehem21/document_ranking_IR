Following Greece, the base camp of I Corps came back to Palestine. Wells was made General Staff Officer, second Grade (GSO2), the vice president of staff accountable for arranging activities. I Corps was cautioned to participate in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign, despite the way that since Blamey had been elevated to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command, the corps came up short on a leader. General Sir Henry Maitland WilsonÃ¢ÂÂthe British leader in Palestine and TransjordanÃ¢ÂÂtrusted that I Corps' loss of transport and flag gear blocked it from partaking in the battle from the beginning. Rather, Wilson endeavored to practice order from the King David Hotel. This ended up being a genuine mistake, as his staff were distracted with political and managerial issues, and were excessively remote from the war zones to practice the nearby order required. Following a progression of turns around, I Corps central command was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General John Lavarack expected order that day. The base camp was defied by a troublesome circumstance, with practically all stores submitted. Lavarack started regrouping his power, focusing the seventh Division for a conclusive push towards Beirut. Hard battling was required before the crusade was conveyed to a fruitful end.
