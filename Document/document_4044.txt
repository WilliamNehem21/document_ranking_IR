After the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, with Stephen in imprisonment in Bristol, Theobald did not quickly join the Empress. He asserted that he expected to converse with Stephen before exchanging his pledge of fealty. In the wake of counseling face to face with Stephen, he verified consent to acknowledge the present conditions, and after that joined Henry of Blois, who had exchanged sides, at Winchester in April for a legatine gathering held to oust Stephen and crown Matilda as ruler. Participation at the committee was inadequate be that as it may, and the Empress couldn't be delegated on the grounds that she didn't hold London. After the ineffective endeavor to crown Matilda, those accumulated at Winchester needed to escape before Stephen's powers; one of Matilda's main supporters, her relative Robert of Gloucester, was caught. Amid their flight Theobald and his kindred diocesans were ransacked of their ponies and clerical vestments. Theobald then took a main part in the dealings that prompted the trading of Robert for Stephen, which occurred in November 1141. Henry of Blois, having exchanged sides once more, at that point held another legatine committee in Westminster, which reaffirmed Stephen as lord. Theobald ritualistically delegated Stephen at Canterbury amid the Christmas court held there.
