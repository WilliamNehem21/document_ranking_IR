In 1952, as John Brooke-Little was entering the universe of heraldry as a Gold Staff Officer, he started investigating the causes of his own arms. His family had been utilizing the arms "Sky blue, six lioncels wild gules", however some examination demonstrated that the Brooke-Littles reserved no privilege to these arms. John attempted to apply for a give in the interest of his dad. At the point when requested info, his dad noticed that the lions recently utilized were inappropriate and that he figured unicorns would be a decent substitution. Red "gouttes" (beads) implied the family's previous holding of the Manor of Slaughterford. The arms were conceded to Raymond Brooke-Little on 5 March 1952. John quartered these arms with those of his mom, Constance Egan. The entire shield of arms is blazoned "Quarterly: I and IV, argent, gouttÃÂ© de sang three unicorns' heads deleted sable outfitted and crined or langued sky blue (Brooke-Little); II and III, purplish blue, two dolphins haurient and addorsed or, the eyes gules, between four shamrocks slipped or". The peak is blazoned "a demi-unicorn wild deleted sable, equipped, crined and unguled or, langued purplish blue and busted gobony or and gules, with a chain or reflexed over the back and joined with a ring or". In the meantime, the maxim of "Recte Aut Nil" (signifying 'accurately or not in any manner') was without a doubt, just as John Brooke-Little's very much utilized identification, blazoned "a triquetra or interweaved by an annulet argent".
