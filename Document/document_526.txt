The Brethren section had been available in the South Branch Potomac River valley from as ahead of schedule as the 1750s despite the fact that records of early Brethren assemblies are not surviving, conceivably on the grounds that they were served by nomad pastors. As ahead of schedule as 1785, two siblings with the surname of Powers drove a Brethren assemblage in the territory. In Dr. Emmert F. Bittinger's verifiable research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his "Allegheny Passage" (1990), it is noticed that the Church of the Brethren division perceived Old Pine Church as having a place with the bigger Beaver Run assemblage, which was focused roughly south of Old Pine Church. The Beaver Run assembly was the primary association of the Brethren in Hampshire County. Old Pine Church and its forerunner structures were most likely used by individuals from the Beaver Run assembly on the grounds that the separation between the northern area of the valley and the congregation on Beaver Run was too extraordinary to even think about traversing effectively. Along these lines, Old Pine Church started as a mission of the Beaver Run gathering. As a result of its area in the region of the Hardy County limit line, the locale served by the congregation spread over the two districts.
