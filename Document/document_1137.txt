City hall leader McDaniels concludes that anything hostile to anybody will be expelled from the Christmas festivities, including Santa Claus, Christmas trees, wreaths, pixie lights, sweet sticks, mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem. Kyle by and by attempts to propose that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas symbol since he doesn't victimize anybody. At home, Kyle is chided by his folks for having confidence in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey leaves the can, spreading defecation recolors wherever he goes, inciting Kyle's folks to fault Kyle for the chaos. Kyle chooses he will bring Mr. Hankey to class to demonstrate he is genuine, yet this just aims more issues as Mr. Hankey masks himself as an unadorned, dried-out bit of defecation when he is around individuals who don't have confidence in him, driving Cartman to inquire as to whether bearing boxes with excrement in them is some sort of Jewish custom. Mr. Hankey jumps at Cartman's face as he sings "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" in D Minor, and Kyle is accused. He is sent to converse with direction guide, Mr. Mackey, yet Kyle possibly gets into further inconvenience when Mr. Hankey washes up in Mr. Mackey's espresso. Cartman, Stan and Kenny trust Kyle is crazy and register him with a psychological establishment.
