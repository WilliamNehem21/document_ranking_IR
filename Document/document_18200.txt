The Calusa were referred to as "Carlos" by the Spanish, which may have sounded like "Calos", a variation of the Muskogean word "kalo" meaning "black" or "powerful". Much of what is known about the Calusa was provided by Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda. Fontaneda was a 13-year-old boy who was the only survivor of a shipwreck off the coast of Florida in 1545. For seventeen years he lived with the Calusa until explorer Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s found him in 1566. MenÃ©ndez took Fontaneda to Spain where he wrote about his experiences. MenÃ©ndez approached the Calusa with the intention of establishing relations with them to ease the settlement of the future Spanish colony. The chief, or "cacique", was named Carlos by the Spanish. Positions of importance in Calusa society were given the adopted names Carlos and Philip, transliterated from Spanish royal tradition. However, the "cacique" Carlos described by Fontaneda was the most powerful chief during Spanish colonization. MenÃ©ndez married his sister in order to facilitate relations between the Spanish and the Calusa. This arrangement was common in societies in South Florida people. Polygamy was a method of solving disputes or settling agreements between rival towns. MenÃ©ndez, however, was already married and expressed discomfort with the union. Unable to avoid the marriage, he took Carlos' sister to Havana where she was educated, and where one account reported that she died years later, the marriage never consummated.
