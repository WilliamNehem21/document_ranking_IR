Whenever Alberta and Saskatchewan were made regions in 1905, the central government held power over their properties and characteristic assets, which made the new regions one of a kind in Canada. The Rutherford government assented to this situation; in light of the fact that the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal administration of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was normal for the commonplace Liberal Party to give itself a role as their safeguard. In this limit, Rutherford indicated the $375,000 every year that the common government got from the national government as pay. In 1910, be that as it may, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch common rights supporter and who numerous years after the fact would be classified "Alberta's first dissenter" by the "Edmonton Journal") moved a goals approaching the Sifton government to "make such strides as might be regarded important to get the control of all such regular assets as are of simply neighborhood concern". Sifton reacted that it was at that point the goal of his administration to start dealings with the government to this end. He declared "I have dependably believedÃÂ ... that we ought to direct our mines and timber. The inquiry isn't currently whether we might want to control our common assets, yet what is the most ideal approach to get them."
