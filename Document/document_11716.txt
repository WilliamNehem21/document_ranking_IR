The current ordered course of action of the class "Banksia" depends on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the "Greenery of Australia" book arrangement. In this course of action, "B.ÃÂ dentata" is set in "Banksia" subgenus "Banksia", since its inflorescences appear as "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s trademark bloom spikes, segment "Banksia" due to its straight styles, and arrangement "Salicinae" in light of the fact that its inflorescences are round and hollow. There has been banter on which species it is most firmly identified with. Alf Salkin had noticed that "B.ÃÂ dentata" shows qualities which are crude inside the sort. In contrast to southern banksias, it has little adolescent leaves and wide dentate grown-up leaves. Alex George finished up at first that its affinities lay with "Banksia integrifolia" by virtue of their comparable inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic investigation distributed in 1994, Kevin Thiele put it in the recently portrayed subseries "Acclives" alongside "B.ÃÂ plagiocarpa", "B.ÃÂ robur" and "B.ÃÂ oblongifolia" inside the arrangement "Salicinae". These four species all have follicles which point somewhat upwards towards the summit of the blossom spike. It was held to be most firmly identified with "B.ÃÂ robur" by virtue of its vast undulate leaves. Salkin had likewise noticed that the seedling leaves of "B.ÃÂ dentata", "B.ÃÂ robur" and "B.ÃÂ oblongifolia" were all comparative and generally straight, proposing a cozy relationship. In any case, this subgrouping of the "Salicinae" was not upheld by George; he limited a cozy association with "B.ÃÂ robur", which he felt was excessively unmistakable.
