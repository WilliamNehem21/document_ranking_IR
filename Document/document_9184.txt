With the flare-up of the Pacific War in December 1941, Northern Area was part the next month into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter particular Japanese dangers to Northern Australia and New Guinea, separately. Southern Area was likewise viewed as fitting for subdivision inferable from its size, so Eastern Area was built up in May 1942 to assume control over control of operational units in New South Wales and southern Queensland. These courses of action balanced out the quantity of region directions at five. Of need, the two northerly directions were principally in charge of besieging and air resistance, while different directions focussed on sea watch and hostile to submarine fighting. Further union of direction and-control obligations along semi-topographical, semi-useful lines occurred among June and September 1942, when specialist over support units was exchanged from the region directions to the recently framed No.ÃÂ 4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne and No.ÃÂ 5 (Maintenance) Group in Sydney. Some finetuning of the region limits happened in August: just as the Northern Territory, North-Western Area was given obligation regarding the segment of Western Australia north of a line drawn south-east from Yampi Sound toward the Northern Territory fringe, and part of Queensland nearby the Barkly Tableland.
