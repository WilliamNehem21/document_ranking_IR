Inside a time of George's increase the Whigs won a mind-boggling triumph in the general decision of 1715. A few individuals from the vanquished Tory Party felt for the Jacobites, who tried to supplant George with Anne's Catholic relative, James Francis Edward Stuart (called "James III and VIII" by his supporters and "the Pretender" by his adversaries). Some disappointed Tories favored a Jacobite disobedience, which wound up known as "The Fifteen". James' supporters, driven by Lord Mar, a disenthralled Scottish aristocrat who had recently filled in as a secretary of state, impelled resistance in Scotland where support for Jacobitism was more grounded than in England. "The Fifteen", in any case, was a bleak disappointment; Lord Mar's fight plans were poor, and James arrived late with too minimal expenditure and too few arms. Before the year's over the disobedience had everything except crumpled. In February 1716, looked with approaching annihilation, James and Lord Mar fled to France. After the defiance was crushed, in spite of the fact that there were a few executions and relinquishments, George acted to direct the Government's reaction, demonstrated tolerance, and spent the salary from the relinquished homes on schools for Scotland and satisfying piece of the national obligation.
