In her 2015 book "Proba the Prophet", Cullhed counters Shanzer's cases, first by noticing that there is no authoritative proof that Faltonia Betitia Proba kicked the bucket in AD 351 and that such an affirmation stays theoretical, best case scenario. Cullhed likewise contends that "there are no 'justification for deciding need of the lyric's opening lines, and that the alleged reference to the AD 387 discussion about Easter could have likely alluded to a before, maybe less celebrated question. With regards to the titles found in later original copies, Cullhed composes that all things considered, they were wrongly embedded amid the Middle Ages by recorders who had naturally confounded the two Probas. Cullhed additionally reasons that if Anicia Proba had expressed "De laudibus Christi", the Latin writer Claudian would have more likely than not applauded her graceful capacities in his AD 395 laudatory praising the joint consulship of her children Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Probinus. Cullhed finishes up: "The proof for defaming Isidore's attribution [of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the writer of the cento] isn't adequate, thus, I will accept that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba." Today, the general accord among classicists and researchers of Latin is that "De laudibus Christi" was to be sure composed by Faltonia Betitia Proba.
