Steve Simels, who had been roused to seek after a journalistic profession by Christgau's mid 1970s composition, wound up auditing the book for "Stereo Review" and offered qualified acclaim. He viewed Christgau's audits as unquestionably elegantly composed with honest basic judgment, noteworthy witticisms and jokes, and a more profound enthusiasm for dark music than most other white faultfinders. In any case, Simels communicated second thoughts about what he saw to be a tasteless feeling of women's activist inner voice, "automatic" liberal governmental issues, and a preference for "applied music", exemplified by "A" grades for every one of the four Ramones collections. In the wake of working through the whole guide, he got himself "shocked to find how impartial [Christgau]'s been as time goes on", and wrote in entirety that it merits perusing, regardless of whether not by any stretch of the imagination dependable. In "High Fidelity", David Browne said a portion of Christgau's thoughts would be unreasonably confounded for newcomers to shake news coverage, yet inferred that "he stays a standout amongst pop's most canny commentators" and the guide capacities best as a method for finding great records, for example, Bill Withers' "Still Bill" (1972)Ã¢ÂÂ generally clouded by the perplexing discography of 1970s prominent music.
