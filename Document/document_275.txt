In "Planet Simpson", writer Chris Turner composes that Bob is incorporated with a highbrow pretender and moderate Republican so the authors can consistently utilize him as a strawman and pincushion. He speaks to high culture while Krusty speaks to low culture, and Bart, stuck in the middle of, dependably wins out. In the book "Leaving Springfield", David L. G. Arnold remarks that Bart is a result of a "mass-culture childhood" and along these lines is Bob's adversary. Baffled by his initial job as the objective of "Krusty's shoddy stiflers", Bob outlines Krusty and assumes control over the show. He changes the substance of that show to exhibit readings of exemplary writing and portions inspecting the enthusiastic existences of pre-teenagers. He trusts that by presenting the children to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold composes that "Weave's own soul and ethical quality are unmistakably unaffected by the high culture he speaks to." He likewise endeavors to "control the flavors of the majority" by turning into a criminal brains. Arnold trusts this is most clear in "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he fixes the decision to turn into the civic chairman of Springfield. At the point when blamed for decision extortion, he rages, "Your feelings of remorse may constrain you to cast a ballot Democratic, yet subtly you long for a heartless Republican who'll cut expenses, brutalize hoodlums, and rule you like a ruler! You need me, Springfield!" He views himself as an individual from the social world class, and cheerfully utilizes Machiavellian strategies to procure and look after power.
