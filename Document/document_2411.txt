The Seventh Circuit maintained the directive dependent on the joined comparability of the gatherings' imprints, merchandise, and channels of trade:ÃÂ  "It's not the way that the gatherings' exchange are similar to the point that is unequivocal, nor even the way that the items are comparative (minimal effort bundled sustenance items).ÃÂ  It is those likenesses combined with the way that, if [Cracker Barrel] wins in this suit, comparable items with confusingly comparative exchange names will be sold through a similar dispersion channel Ã¢ÂÂ markets, and regularly a similar supermarkets Ã¢ÂÂ and promoted together."ÃÂ  In Judge Posner's estimation, these similitudes Ã¢ÂÂ in spite of the distinctions in the gatherings' individual logos and paying little mind to where the items are situated in connection to one another in supermarkets Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ might lead shoppers to "think all the Kraft items bearing the 'Wafer Barrel' name were delivered in relationship with the Defendant." In financial matters this conduct is alluded to as 'customary forward confusion.'ÃÂ  The court additionally closed the probability of disarray was exacerbated by the way that the two items at issue were economical; hence, purchasers were probably not going to examine their particular names. In light of the decision, Kraft Foods and Cracker Barrel made an understanding with respect to the utilization of the Cracker Barrel name. In return for Kraft dropping the trademark-encroachment claim, Cracker Barrel consented to sell its items under the brand name "CB Old Country Store."
