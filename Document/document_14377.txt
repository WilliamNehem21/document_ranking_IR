In 1919, John B. Whealton, Chincoteague-conceived however a Florida occupant, induced the Virginia General Assembly to concede a sanction to his Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company to construct an interstate from the terrain to the island. Whealton presented the triumphant offer to assemble the interstate just as picking up the sanction for his organization to work it. The street was initially a toll crossing, and early plans made them achieve the island south of downtown, close to the site of the present Carnival Grounds, yet Whealton induced the town committee to have the terminal point be downtown, close to the Atlantic Hotel, the island's biggest. The street was near consummation when a noteworthy flame obliterated a lot of downtown, including the lodging, on February 5, 1920. There was then just a little, poorly prepared flame organization in Chincoteague, and the flame was battled by men of the Coast Guard from the stations close to the island. The lodging was underinsured and not reconstructed, however others had its spot, and the chamber exploited the calamity to fix Main Street. The flame and poor climate in the winters of 1921 and 1922 postponed the boulevard, which was formally opened on November 15, 1922 by Virginia Governor E. Lee Trinkle. Most vehicles on the principal day ended up buried in mud once a storm transformed the highway into an entanglement. By and by, the interstate demonstrated a triumph, and by the end of the year more than 100 vehicles were crossing it on a normal day. Water from terrain wells was channeled along the boulevard, enabling the town to offer running water.
