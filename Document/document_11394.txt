At 1800ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 29, Omar achieved its pinnacle power with 10Ã¢ÂÂminute supported breezes of 185ÃÂ km/h (115ÃÂ mph) and a base barometric weight of 920ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 27.17ÃÂ inHg) as assessed by the JMA; this force was kept up for 24ÃÂ hours before an enduring debilitating pattern started. The JTWC assessed higher 1Ã¢ÂÂminute breezes of around 240ÃÂ km/h (150ÃÂ mph), making Omar a super tropical storm. After two days, the tropical storm approached enough to the Philippines to warrant observing from PAGASA, who named the tempest "Lusing". By 1500ÃÂ UTC on SeptemberÃÂ 3, the JMA minimized Omar to a hurricane, in spite of the fact that the JTWC kept up its storm power through the following day. Heading commonly westbound, the tempest made landfall on the east shoreline of Taiwan close Hualien City on SeptemberÃÂ 4. In the wake of crossing the island in seven hours, Omar left the bank of Yunlin County and rose into the Taiwan Strait. The tempest crossed the waterway and moved shorewards in eastern China close Xiamen, Fujian, on SeptemberÃÂ 5. Inland, Omar immediately declined into a tropical melancholy before turning west-southwest. It continued crosswise over southern China while vigorously debilitating, and totally scattered over northern Vietnam on SeptemberÃÂ 9.
