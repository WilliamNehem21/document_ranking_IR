"ThÃÂ¼ringen" was available amid the main foray by the German armada into the North Sea, which occurred on 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 November 1914. No British powers were experienced amid the task. A second task pursued on 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16 December. This foray was the inception of a technique embraced by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the leader of the High Seas Fleet. Naval commander von Ingenohl proposed to utilize the battlecruisers of "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to strike British beach front towns to bait out bits of the Grand Fleet where they could be demolished by the High Seas Fleet. At an early stage 15 December the armada left port to attack the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on the English coast. That night, the German fight armada of approximately twelve gunboatsÃ¢ÂÂincluding "ThÃÂ¼ringen" and her three sistersÃ¢ÂÂand eight pre-battleships came to inside of a disengaged squadron of six British war vessels. Conflicts between the opponent destroyer screens in the dimness persuaded von Ingenohl that he was looked with the whole Grand Fleet. Compelled from Kaiser Wilhelm II to abstain from taking a chance with the armada superfluously, von Ingenohl severed the commitment and turned the fight armada back toward Germany.
