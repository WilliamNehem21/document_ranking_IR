In the late spring of 1867, Bache and Dannreuther shaped "The Working Men's Society," a little relationship to advance the music of Wagner, Liszt and Schumann in England, with Karl Klindworth as a senior statesman for the gathering. The Society met routinely at each other's homes for the investigation and dialog of this music. The principal think about session met in December and comprised of the "Turning Song" from Wagner's musical drama "The Flying Dutchman", played by Dannreuther in Liszt's piano translation. At the gathering the following month, the gathering handled the initial two scenes of "Das Rheingold". The gathering which pursued included a perusing of "Kick the bucket WalkÃÂ¼re". Neither of the last two works had been displayed anyplace; their reality debuts at the Munich Court Opera were as yet two years away. Klindworth's unique association with Wagner guaranteed that the gathering approached the scores. In the July 1869 gathering, Liszt student Anna Mehlig played Liszt's First Piano Concerto for the gathering. Wagner and Liszt were not by any means the only arrangers talked aboutÃ¢ÂÂBach, Beethoven, Chopin, Henselt, Raff and Schumann were among the others whose music was included. Notwithstanding, the primary focal point of the gathering remained the music of Wagner.
