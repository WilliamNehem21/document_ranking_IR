During the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found alongside survives from other Mauritian creatures in the Mare aux Songes swamp, and were recognized as having a place with a rail by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1866. He likewise decided they had a place with the winged animals in the seventeenth century depictions and representations. In 1869, Milne-Edwards consolidated the family name of "Aphanapteryx imperialis", which had been authored the earlier year by the Austrian naturalist Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld for the Hoefnagel painting, with the more seasoned explicit name "broecki". Due to nomenclatural need, the class name was later joined with the most established species name "bonasia", which was authored by the Belgian researcher Edmond de SÃÂ©lys Longchamps in 1848. SÃÂ©lys Longchamps had initially named the class "Apterornis", wherein he likewise incorporated the RÃÂ©union solitaire and the RÃÂ©union swamphen, yet the name was engrossed by "Aptornis", a fledgling depicted by the English scientist Richard Owen in 1844. "Aphanapteryx" signifies "imperceptible wing", however the significance of "bonasia" is indistinct. Some early records allude to red rails by the vernacular names for the hazel grouse, "Tetrastes bonasia", so the name clearly starts there. The name itself maybe alludes to "bonasus", signifying "bull" in Latin, or "bonum" and "assum", signifying "great meal". It has additionally been recommended to be a Latin type of the French word "bonasse", which means dimwitted or well-intentioned.
