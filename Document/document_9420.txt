Revamping Australforce was an early need for Wynter. Official history specialist Gavin Long depicted the power which touched base on Convoy US 3 as a "mishmash" of units, and noticed that none of its components had their full portion of gear. The infantry was outfitted just with rifles and automatic rifles, the mounted guns had no firearms and the quantities of vehicles and supplies of specialized gear missed the mark regarding necessities. Subsequent to considering alternatives created by Morshead to shape the power into a solid detachment assemble with supporting units, Wynter rather composed it into two infantry detachments (the eighteenth and the new 25th), each with three legions. These detachments were to be upheld by an assault rifle force, two field batteries, two enemy of tank batteries, two organizations of architects and bolster units. The 25th Brigade's three new infantry legions were to be kept an eye on by the 459 infantry substitutions and 1,300 officers exchanged from the mounted guns, assault rifle and bolster units. Few officers and enrolled men were likewise to be exchanged from the eighteenth Brigade. Because of labor deficiencies, the new legions would be composed into three rifle organizations instead of the standard four. Wynter chose this association as he expected that big guns weapons and specialized hardware would set aside a long effort to be conveyed, and there was a high likelihood that his power would need to go into battle at short notice with what it had. The British War Office endorsed this structure by 22 June.
