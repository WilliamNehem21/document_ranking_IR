Bronze articles, for example, pins, gems, and bolts have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no nearby wellspring of tin and copper mineral, this exhibits long separation exchange, presumably with the southwest. Albeit bronze was not created at Maiden Castle, there is proof of it being revised. Great quality iron metal could be found in the encompassing zone, however the slope stronghold does not seem to have been a middle for iron creation in this period; this isn't bizarre as not many slope posts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire display hints of iron generation. Right off the bat in the Iron Age, the greater part of the earthenware found at Maiden Castle was delivered locallyÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ inside about ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ anyway later on sources further abroad turned out to be progressively essential, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the stoneware originated from the region around Poole Harbor, more than away. This long-run exchange has been taken as proof for expanding associations with gatherings of individuals over huge territories and the rise of ancestral personalities. In spite of the fact that Sharples states that created slope strongholds, for example, Maiden Castle are not towns and can't be considered really urban on the grounds that they are so firmly identified with agribusiness and capacity, Cunliffe and individual archeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne depict created slope fortifications as "town-like settlements", a type of proto-urbanism.
