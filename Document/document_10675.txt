The Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan is a medieval church in the network of Llanidan, in Anglesey, North Wales, near the Menai Strait. The principal church on the site was set up in the seventh century by St Nidan, the inquisitor of the religious community at Penmon, Anglesey, yet the most established pieces of the present structure, which is currently shut and incompletely in remnants, date from the fourteenth century. In around 1500 the congregation was broadened by the expansion of a second nave on the north side, isolated from the prior nave by an arcade of six curves. Somewhere in the range of 1839 and 1843 another congregation was fabricated adjacent to serve the nearby network, incompletely because of the expense of fixing the old church. A significant part of the structure was in this manner wrecked, leaving just piece of the western end and the focal arcade. The choice was censured at the time by Harry Longueville Jones, a priest and savant, who bemoaned the "despairing destiny" of what he called "one of the biggest and most vital [churches] in the island of Anglesey". Other grateful remarks have been made about the congregation both when its fractional pulverization.
