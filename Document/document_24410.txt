The "Sovetsky Soyuz"-class ships devoted a total weight of to armor protection, a slightly greater weight than that of the larger Japanese "Yamato" class (). Their armor was intended to resist 406Â mm shells and 500Â kg bombs, specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35Â° and 50Â° from the centerline. This led to the very unusual situation where the armor belt thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines, which had to be compensated for by thicker armor. The belt was long and covered 57% of the total waterline length. It was inclined 5Â° to increase its resistance to flat-trajectory shells. Over the machinery spaces it was thick and increased in steps until it was thick over the forward magazines. It was over the rear magazine. The belt armor was carried forward of the magazines at a thickness of and terminated in a steeply sloped (30Â°) transverse bulkhead that reduced to at the lower deck where it was continued down to the inner bottom by a bulkhead. Forward of this bulkhead was a 20Â mm splinter belt that continued all the way to the bow. The main armor belt dropped down to the main deck from the upper deck abreast the aft turret to reduce weight. This "step" was protected by plates. A transverse bulkhead separated the rear turret and the ship's sides. The main part of the armored citadel was closed off by a 230Â mm forward bulkhead and a rear bulkhead, both of homogeneous armor. Splinter armor thick covered the upper portion of the citadel.
