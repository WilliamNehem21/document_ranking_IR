Some have theorized that Clark's naivetÃÂ© at giving "soundbite" answers hurt him in the media amid his essential battle. The day after he propelled his crusade, for instance, he was approached on the off chance that he would have voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution, which allowed President Bush the ability to wage the Iraq War, an extensive issue in the 2004 battle. Clark stated, "At the time, I likely would have voted in favor of it, however I believe that is too basic an inquiry," at that point "I don't have the foggiest idea in the event that I would have or not. I've said it both ways since when you get into this, what happens is you need to set yourself in a placeÃ¢ÂÂon parity, I most likely would have voted in favor of it." Finally, Clark's press secretary elucidated his situation as "you said you would have voted in favor of the goals as influence for an UN-based arrangement." After this arrangement of reactions, in spite of the fact that Clark contradicted the war, "The New York Times" ran a story with the feature "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was more than once depicted as uncertain on this basic issue by his adversaries all through the essential season. He was compelled to keep on illuminating his position and at the second essential discussion he stated, "I believe it's truly humiliating that a gathering of applicants up here are chipping away at changing the administration in this nation and can't get their own story straightÃÂ ... I would have never voted in favor of war. The war was a superfluous war, it was an elective war, and it's been a tremendous vital mix-up for this nation."
