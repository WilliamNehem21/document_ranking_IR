In 1950, Silberkleit brought back "Future", under the title "Future Combined with Science Fiction Stories"; this allowed Silberkleit to keep the rights to both the titles. The first issue was dated May/June 1950. In January 1952 the title changed to just "Future Science Fiction Stories". Payment rates at that time were one to three cents per word. In the summer of 1953, with "Future" still in pulp format, Silberkleit issued a single digest-sized magazine with no number and no date, under the title "Science Fiction Stories". Another issue with the same format and title followed in the spring of 1954, also unnumbered. Silberkleit decided that the digest format was partly responsible for the good sales of these experimental issues, so he changed the format of "Future" from pulp to digest. The first issue in the new format was dated January 1955, and in response to reader feedback the title was changed to "Science Fiction Stories". The volume numbering was continued from the existing "Future" volume numbering, despite the fact that the title was taken from "Science Fiction", the earlier magazine. Complicating matters, Silberkleit decided later in 1955 that the market could support both titles, so he revived "Future" again. Since "Science Fiction Stories" was using the volume numbering from the previous pulp-format incarnation of "Future", Silberkleit switched to an issue number format, with no volume. The first issue was numbered 28, counting forward from the May/June 1950 issue as 1.
