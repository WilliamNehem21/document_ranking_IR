"Obscure" was, alongside "Abnormal Tales", an imperative early impact on the dream kind. In the foreword to "From Unknown Worlds", in 1948, Campbell remarked that dream before "Obscure" had been a lot of implanted with "agony and dread"; his methodology in "Obscure" had been to expect that the "animals of folklore and fables" could be characters in an interesting story as effectively as they could be made piece of a repulsiveness story. Frightfulness stories, he stated, had a spot, yet "ghastliness infused with a sharp and harmed needle is similarly as powerful as when connected with the obtuse contrivance procedure of the alleged Gothic repulsiveness story". Campbell demanded a similar reasonable way to deal with dream that he expected of his sci-fi essayists, and in the expressions of Clareson, this prompted the devastation of "the common story tone as well as a large portion of the trappings that had overwhelmed dream from "The Castle of Otranto" and "The Monk" through the nineteenth century to "Peculiar Tales"". "Obscure" immediately isolated itself from "Unusual Tales", whose dreams still essentially expected to deliver dread or stun. The nearest forerunner to "Obscure" was Thorne Smith, whose forbiddance time "Topper" stories likewise blended dream with diversion. Prior to "Obscure", dream had gotten minimal genuine consideration, however now and again essayists, for example, James Branch Cabell had accomplished decency. As Ashley would like to think, "Obscure" made the cutting edge kind of imagination, however business accomplishment for the class needed to hold up until the 1970s.
