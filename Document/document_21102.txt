Two major projects were ongoing near Burlington at this point. On AprilÂ 29, 1952, the "W.E.Â Fitzgerald" struck the two-lane lift bridge at the entrance to Hamilton Harbour.
Damage to the crossing resulted in the QEW's closure until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. Construction also began on the "Freeman Diversion" interchange to provide better access to this new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.
The Freeman Diversion opened to traffic in August 1958,
with the old route becoming an eastward extension of Plains Road.
Premier Frost opened the , four-lane skyway two months later on OctoberÂ 30. Although it greatly reduced traffic delays, it was not without controversy due to its height, cost, tolling, and most especially its name. Residents in Burlington demanded it be named the Burlington Skyway, while Hamilton residents countered with the Hamilton Skyway. As a compromise, the Thomas B. McQuesten Skyway was proposed. However, the provincial government had the final say in the matter, and opted to name it the Burlington Bay Skyway. Tolls were collected beginning on NovemberÂ 10.
