The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s loss was shoaling or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of Caribou Island when the vessel "unknowingly raked a reef" during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids. This theory was supported by a 1976Â Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from "Arthur M. Anderson" observed that "Edmund Fitzgerald" sailed through this exact area. Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship "hogged" during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain. Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of "a recent collision or grounding anywhere." Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon's 1994Â photography that "explicitly show[s] the devastation of the "Edmund Fitzgerald"". Shannon's photography of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s overturned stern showed "no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal."
