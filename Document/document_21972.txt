Although "Alleyway" sold well enough during its production run, it has not been re-released as a Nintendo Player's Choice title, and reviews of the game have been mostly mixed to negative. "Mean Machines" gave the game a score of 33%, criticizing its repetitiveness and stating "this variant doesn't have much more to offer than the original ["Breakout"]". The magazine's staff added "once you've finished a couple of screens, you'll be bored stiff" and compared the game to its predecessor, "Arkanoid", regarding the lack of power-ups in "Alleyway". "Electronic Gaming Monthly" staff also reviewed the game, with four separate reviews giving the game scores of 6/10, 6/10, 5/10, and 3/10. All four reviewers compared it to "Arkanoid", complaining about the lack of enhancement over the "Breakout" format. GamesRadar shared the sentiment in their review of the 3DS re-release, with reviewer Nathan Meunier giving it a score of 5/10 and stating "Alleyway wasn't so hot when it first came out, and it still pales when put it side-by-side to other similarly priced offerings". He further added at times the game appeared to "hate" the player with its difficulty, though acknowledged that the addition of save states "takes some of the sting out of losing". "Retro Gamer"s Darran Jones called it "pretty piss-poor all the way back in 1989", noting the bland levels and lack of power-ups found in "Arkanoid", and that many similar clones had outperformed it.
