His first year of Q-ship service was frustrating for Stuart and the crew. Although, prior to his attachment to the ship, "Farnborough" had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine (the "U-68" in March 1916), there had been no successes since. In February 1917, Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack, the "Farnborough" would have to actually be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire. On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern Ireland when the lone "Farnborough" was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range. Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold, causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship. The crew were well rehearsed and the "panic party" took to their boats with a great show of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons. When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking, the submarine "U-83" pulled up just ten yards (9m) from the wreck. A hail of shot was then unleashed by the "Farnborough's" remaining crew from their six-pounder gun and several machine guns into the stationary submarine. The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U-boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck. Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water, one of whom subsequently died from his wounds.
