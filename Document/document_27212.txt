Winslet was keen on playing Rose DeWitt Bukater, a free-spirited socialite aboard the ill-fated RMS "Titanic", in James Cameron's epic romance "Titanic" (1997). Cameron was initially reluctant to cast her, preferring the stars Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow, but Winslet pleaded with him, "You don't understand! I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" Her persistence led Cameron to hire her. Leonardo DiCaprio featured as her love interest, Jack. "Titanic" had a production budget of US$200 million, and its arduous principal photography was held at Rosarito Beach where a replica of the ship was created. Filming proved to be taxing for Winslet. She nearly drowned, caught influenza, suffered from hypothermia on being submerged in freezing water, and had bruises on her arms and knees. The workload allowed her only four hours of sleep per day and she felt drained by the experience. David Ansen, writing for "Newsweek", praised Winslet for capturing her character's zeal with delicacy, and Mike Clark of "USA Today" considered her to be the film's prime asset. Against expectations, "Titanic" went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time to that point, earning over US$2 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and established Winslet as a global star. The film won 11 Academy Awardsthe most for any filmincluding Best Picture and gained Winslet a Best Actress nomination.
