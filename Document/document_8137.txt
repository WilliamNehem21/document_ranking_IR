The idea of a downtown transport burrow was first proposed in 1974 amid talks between Governor Dan Evans and Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman about territorial transportation extends in light of the proposed expansion of Interstate 90 into Seattle by means of a third coasting scaffold crossing Lake Washington. Metro Transit later appointed an examination into the transport burrow, discharged the next July, which verified that it would not have the capacity to satisfactorily fulfill the surge hour need of downtown transport ridership by 1980. The examination recommended that a twofold decked passage with computerized guideway travel to supplement transport administration, running from Union Station to the Seattle Center, would almost certainly fulfill anticipated need at an expected expense of $450 million. Eventually, the arrangement was rejected in view of the staggering expense of ventilation for diesel transports that would utilize the passage. The transport burrow proposition reemerged in 1979, laying out a passage from South Jackson Street to Pine Street that would convey 200 transports an hour toward every path at an expense of up to $350 million with the alternative of change for electric rail travel later on. The passage was proposed by Metro authorities and designing specialists Parsons Brinckerhoff as an answer for declining downtown traffic, and was preferred gotten over elective ideas. The proposition increased further help from Metro Transit in its long haul "Metro 1990" plan, embraced in 1981, as a travel shopping center or passage under third Avenue conveying transports that could be changed over for a light rail framework. The Puget Sound Council of Governments (PSCOG), a provincial arranging office, supported Metro Transit's proposition and coordinated the passage into its proposed light rail line associating Seattle to Snohomish County.
