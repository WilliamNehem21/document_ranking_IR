Because of the U.S. section into World War I and coming about blockage on the country's railways, the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) requested the Pennsylvania Railroad to allow B&O traveler trains to utilize its Hudson River passages and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, starting April 28, 1918, wiping out the B&O's requirement for the ship association from Jersey City. Following the finish of World WarÃÂ I, the Pennsylvania Railroad kept on permitting B&O traveler trains to utilize Pennsylvania Station for an additional eight years. On September 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania Railroad ended its agreement with the B&O, and the last's trains returned to the utilization of the Jersey Central's Jersey City terminal. Travelers were then exchanged to transports that met the train directly on the stage. These transports were carried over the Hudson River into Manhattan and Brooklyn, where they continued to different "stations" around the city on four distinct courses, including the Vanderbilt Hotel, Wanamaker's, Columbus Circle, and Rockefeller Center. B&O's busiest "Illustrious Blue" transport terminal at in Manhattan opened on December 17, 1928. Associated with Grand Central Terminal by an underground concourse, it was cut in marble and outfitted with Art Deco lighting installations and cowhide couches. This course of action would proceed until the inevitable destruction of the "Regal Blue" in 1958.
