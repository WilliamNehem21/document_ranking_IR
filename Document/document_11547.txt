Harihara's nephew and protÃÂ©gÃÂ©, the sensational writer Raghavanka of Hampi, whose style is contrasted with that of tenth century artist Ranna, was the first to set up the "shatpadi" meter in Kannada writing in the epic "Harishchandra Kavya" (1200). As indicated by L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is trusted that in no other language has the narrative of King Harishchandra been translated along these lines. The composing is a unique in convention and motivation that completely builds up the capability of the "shatpadi" meter. The portrayal has numerous important elegiac stanzas, for example, the grieving of Chandramati over the demise of her young child Lohitashva from snake chomp. The very composition that made Raghavanka well known was dismissed by his master, Harihara. His other surely understood compositions, holding fast to severe Shaiva standards and written to pacify his master, are the "Siddharama charitra" (or "Siddharama Purana"), an overwhelming complex commendation of the humane twelfth century Veerashaiva holy person, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the "Somanatha charitra", an advocate work that portrays the life of holy person Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (present day Lakshmeshwar), his embarrassment by a Jain young lady and his retribution; the "Viresvara charita", a sensational story of the visually impaired fierceness of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the "Hariharamahatva", a record of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and "Sarabha charitra". The last two works of art are viewed as lost.
