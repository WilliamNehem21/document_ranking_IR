"Banksia blechnifolia" is a prostrate bush that develops to about high and spreads to over. It has thick flat stems up to long and thick that lie over the ground. They are canvassed in fine corroded darker hide, which turns dim with age. The weathered herringbone leaves rise vertically from the stems on thick long petioles, which have two thin ribs on the undersurface. The abandons themselves are long, with 8Ã¢ÂÂ 22 profound projections on each leaf edge. Barely triangular to generally straight fit as a fiddle and long, these flaps are either oppositely or then again organized along the leaf midline, and emerge at 60Ã¢ÂÂ 80 degrees. The leaf cutting edge limits for the top third of its length to a pointed peak. Blossoming happens from mid September to late November, with the bloom spikes, known as inflorescences, emerging at the closures of the stems. Up to high and wide, they are generally red-darker to salmon-shaded. The individual blooms are ruddy pink with a cream base, blurring to light dark colored and after that dim as they age. The perianth is long, incorporates a 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ mm appendage and is shrouded in fine hide. Old blossoms stay on the spike, clouding the creating seed cases known as follicles. Up to 25 in number, these are shrouded in hide and oval, estimating long, by high, and wide.
