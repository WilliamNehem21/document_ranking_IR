In 1971, vocalist David Johansen shaped the New York Dolls with guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia; Rivets was supplanted by Sylvain in 1972. The band was intended to be a brief undertaking for the individuals, who were club-going young people that had gone to New York City with various vocation interests. As Sylvain reviewed, "We just said 'Hello, perhaps this will get us a few chicks.' That appeared to be a sufficient reason." He and Murcia initially wanted to work in the apparel business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was over the road from a toy fix shop called the New York Dolls Hospital, which gave them the thought for their name. The gathering before long started playing normally in lower Manhattan and earned a clique following inside a couple of months with their rash style of shake music. In any case, record organizations were reluctant to sign them due to their dramatic cross-dressing and outright obscenity. In October 1972, they earned the enthusiasm of commentators when they opened for English musical gang the Faces at the Empire Pool in Wembley. In any case, on the New York Dolls' first voyage through England that year, Murcia passed on in the wake of expending a deadly mix of liquor and methaqualone. They enrolled Jerry Nolan as his substitution, while administrators Marty Thau, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still attempted to discover the band a record bargain.
