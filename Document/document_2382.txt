As on Mos Def's different collections, he talked a commitment to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") toward the beginning of "The Ecstatic", before "Supermagic" started with an example of Malcolm X's 1964 discourse at Oxford Union. The example introduced the collection's "little globe explanation", "Pitchfork" writer Nate Patrin clarified, demonstrating that Mos Def had "a stake in an option that is more prominent than only one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from "Outcome of Sound" trusted the discourse presented "a political collection including worldwide beats and perspectives". As indicated by "Washington Post" faultfinder Allison Stewart, Mos Def appeared to be similarly intrigued by the Obama-period zeitgeist as in records of the past, for example, the mid 1980s BedfordÃ¢ÂÂ Stuyvesant setting of "Life in Marvelous Times". Youthful esteemed the melody anthemic for "an apparently confusing age that routinely observes occasions, for example, a Black man being chosen leader of a country floundering in racial imbalance". From Christgau's point of view, Mos Def offered a philosophy in the verses: "A greater amount of not exactly ever before/It's simply a lot of additional for your brain to assimilate/It's unnerving like heck, yet there's no uncertainty/We can't be alive in a matter of moments however at this point".
