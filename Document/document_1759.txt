The assignment of warrior units to what had all the earmarks of being deliberately immaterial ground assault missions prompted an emergency in confidence that encouraged the purported "Morotai Mutiny" in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, incorporating Australia's driving expert in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, offered their renunciations in dissent. Albeit one of the "rebels", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had prior voiced his worries to Cobby and his central station staff with respect to the adequacy of first TAF's entrusting, the AOC was shocked by the renunciations. He addressed the officers independently and as a gathering, asking them, "Is this something against me, or having a conflict with me in this, provided that along these lines, in the event that you feel that I have tumbled down in my activity, I will straight away request to be reviewed," to which they answered, "It has nothing to do with you." Cobby revealed the occurrence to his quick prevalent, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who educated the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All advanced toward Morotai and met the pilots included, and all presumed that Cobby ought to be assuaged of his direction.
