In the decades after the war huge numbers of Cardus' prior legends and colleagues passed on. On Fry's demise in 1956 Cardus composed of him as "An extraordinary Englishman, estimated by any benchmarks of occupation, workmanship and civilisation". In 1959, still in saddle, Newman kicked the bucket at 90 years old; Cardus thought of him as the most remarkable of all music commentators, and figured he ought to have been selected a Companion of Honor (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham kicked the bucket on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for certain years noticed a decrease in his old companion's forces, however he had written in 1954, on the event of Beecham's 75th birthday celebration, of the obligation the music world owed to the conductor: "He drove us out of the Teutonic imprisonment. He demonstrated us other and progressively delicate universes". After Beecham's passing, Cardus sorted out the distribution of a celebratory diary, as he had finished with Kathleen Ferrier. To a degree the left symbols were supplanted with new legends: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus kept up a sharp enmity towards quite a bit of contemporary music; examining Pierre Boulez's "Pli selon pli" after an execution in 1965, he said he "couldn't relate the shifted progression of aural wonders to music as my melodic knowledge and faculties perceive music".
