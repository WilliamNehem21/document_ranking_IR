"Armillaria luteobubalina" was first portrayed in 1978 by mycologists Roy Watling and Glen Kile, who examined its consequences for a quickly developing ranch of "Eucalyptus regnans" close Traralgon, Victoria. The ranch, set up in 1963, comprised to a great extent of trees with a mean stature of about . A group of dead and kicking the bucket trees found in 1973 proposed assault by a harmful essential pathogen, that is, one fit for tainting a host before attack by other, auxiliary pathogens. This finding was conflicting with the pathogenic conduct of the known "Armillaria" species in Australia at the time, "A.ÃÂ mellea" and "A.ÃÂ elegans". Further investigation throughout the following couple of years demonstrated that the parasite spread by the development of underground mycelia in root frameworks, extending outward from the underlying tainted stump at a normal of every year. Most Australian records of "Armillaria" contaminations alluded to "A.ÃÂ mellea", in view of the nearness of dark rhizomorphs. For more than one hundred years, "A.ÃÂ mellea" was believed to be a pleiomorphic (happening in different particular structures) species with an across the board conveyance and host range, and variable pathogenicity. which prompted extraordinary perplexity among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike. In 1973, Veikko Hintikka detailed a method to recognize "Armillaria" species by developing them together as single spore secludes on petri dishes and watching changes in the morphology of the way of life. Utilizing comparative strategies, mycologists in the long run verified that the "Armillaria mellea" species complex in Europe and North America in actuality comprised of five and ten unmistakable "organic species", individually.
