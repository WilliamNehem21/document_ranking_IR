From 22 February to 13 March 1915, I Squadron was in the Baltic for unit preparing. Following their arrival toward the North Sea, the boats took part in a progression of uneventful armada forays on 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 March, 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 April, 21Ã¢ÂÂ 22 April, 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 May, and 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 May. The armada was to a great extent idle until 4 August, when I Squadron came back to the Baltic for another round of preparing moves. From that point, the squadron was connected to the maritime power that endeavored to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian maritime powers in August 1915. The strike drive incorporated the eight I Squadron warships, the battlecruisers , and "Seydlitz", a few light cruisers, 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers. The arrangement called for directs in Russian minefields to be cleared with the goal that the Russian maritime nearness, which incorporated the pre-man of war vessel , could be wiped out. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to keep Russian boats from coming back to the Gulf. "Oldenburg" and most of the other huge boats of the High Seas Fleet stayed outside the Gulf for the whole of the activity, to forestall conceivable mediation by the Russian armada outside the Gulf. The gunboats and were disconnected on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to wreck "Slava", however they neglected to sink the old ship. Following three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August, yet reports of Allied submarines in the territory provoked a German withdrawal from the Gulf the next day. By 26 August, I Squadron had come back to Wilhelmshaven.
