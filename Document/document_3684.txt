Fenton touches base at the oak tree and sings of his joy ("Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola"/"From my lips, a melody of rapture flies") finishing with "Lips that are kissed lose none of their charm." Nannetta enters to complete the line with "To be sure, they reestablish it, similar to the moon." The ladies arrive and camouflage Fenton as a priest, disclosing to him that they have masterminded to ruin Ford's and Caius' arrangements. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, trains her partners ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio"/"On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, deft spirits") before every one of the characters touch base on the scene. Falstaff's endeavored love scene with Alice is hindered by the declaration that witches are drawing nearer, and the men, camouflaged as mythical people and pixies, soundly whip Falstaff. Finally he perceives Bardolfo in camouflage. The joke is finished, and Falstaff recognizes that he has gotten his due. Passage reports that a wedding will result. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, additionally in disguise, request that Ford convey a similar gift for them also. Passage leads the twofold service. Caius finds that rather than Nannetta, his lady of the hour is the hidden Bardolfo, and Ford has accidentally honored the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Passage acknowledges the "fait accompli" with great beauty. Falstaff, satisfied to get himself not by any means the only trick, broadcasts in a fugue, which the whole organization sings, that all the world is indiscretion, and all are figures of fun ("Tutto nel mondo ÃÂ¨ burlaÃÂ ... Tutti gabbati!"/"Everything on the planet is a jestÃÂ ...").
