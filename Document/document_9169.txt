MacLaren was welcomed by the Melbourne Cricket Club to convey a group to Australia amid the English winter of 1901Ã¢ÂÂ 02. This was the last secretly composed group to speak to England at Test level in Australia, with consequent ones playing under the shades of the MCC. Many driving players were inaccessibleÃ¢ÂÂYorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not allowed to visit by their skipper Lord Hawke. The group was made a decision to be powerless, yet contained a few players toward the start of their professions who went on to progress at Test level. Sydney Barnes was picked by MacLaren subsequent to playing just a bunch of province matches. Barnes' prosperity on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 persuaded MacLaren of his value, to the amazement and demonization of reporters, a large portion of whom had never observed him. Barnes started the visit well, however did not continue ahead with his chief. Amid a tempest on part of the ocean venture, MacLaren, guessing on their odds of survival, remarked to a colleague: "In the event that we go down, at any rate that bugger Barnes will run down with us." The group lost their first match and kept on battling. MacLaren conflicted with experts in Melbourne over his entitlement to pick an umpire, yet he started to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 of every a visit coordinate.
