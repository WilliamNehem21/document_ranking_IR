During the 1970s he starred in a series of low-budget British films, including two in 1975, "Spanish Fly"âcalled a "gruesome smutfest" by the writer Christopher Fowlerâand "The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones", described by the "Film Review Digest" as a "cheap, crude, sexed-up rehash" of the other film adaptations of Henry Fielding's source novel.
In 1977 he starred in "The Last Remake of Beau Geste" and "The Hound of the Baskervilles", the latter starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as Holmes and Watson; Terry-Thomas thought that "it was the most outrageous film I ever appeared inÂ ... there was no magicÂ ... it was bad!" By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film "The Tempest," but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.
