"Unknown" was, along with "Weird Tales", an important early influence on the fantasy genre. In the foreword to "From Unknown Worlds", in 1948, Campbell commented that fantasy before "Unknown" had been too much infused with "gloom and terror"; his approach in "Unknown" had been to assume that the "creatures of mythology and folklore" could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a place, but "horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called Gothic horror tale". Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers, and in the words of Clareson, this led to the destruction of "not only the prevalent narrative tone but also most of the trappings that had dominated fantasy from "The Castle of Otranto" and "The Monk" through the nineteenth century to "Weird Tales"". "Unknown" quickly separated itself from "Weird Tales", whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock. The closest predecessor to "Unknown" was Thorne Smith, whose prohibition-era "Topper" stories also mixed fantasy with humor. Before "Unknown", fantasy had received little serious attention, though on occasion writers such as James Branch Cabell had achieved respectability. In Ashley's opinion, "Unknown" created the modern genre of fantasy, though commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.
