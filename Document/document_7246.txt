The Pacific ocean bottom contains numerous guyots of the Mesozoic age that created in shallow oceans. These are submarine mountains which are described by a level top and more often than not the nearness of carbonate stages that ascended over the ocean surface amid the center Cretaceous time frame. A significant number of these seamounts were some time ago atolls, despite the fact that there are a few contrasts to show day reef frameworks. Every one of these structures initially shaped as volcanoes in the Mesozoic sea. The covering underneath these volcanoes will in general die down as it cools, and in this manner the islands and seamounts sink. Bordering reefs may have created on the volcanoes, which at that point progressed toward becoming obstruction reefs as the volcanoes die down and transform into atolls; these edges encompass tidal ponds or salt marshes. Proceeded with subsidence balanced by development of the reefs prompted the arrangement of thick carbonate stages. Once in a while volcanic action proceeded after the arrangement of the atoll or atoll-like structure, and amid scenes where the stages transcended ocean level erosional highlights, for example, channels and blue openings created. In the long run, these stages suffocated for reasons that are frequently misty.
