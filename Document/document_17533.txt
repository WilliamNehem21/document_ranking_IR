Website reviewers deemed "Soul Reaver"s gameplay too non-linear and its objectives too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did little or nothing to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. "Next Generation Magazine" considered the game challenging due to "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. "The Tampa Tribune" also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the "auto-facing" feature made the difficulties negligible. "PC Zone" criticized the PC port of the game for "chunky" graphics and bad camera controls, stating "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". "Computer Gaming World" similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the Lucifer-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". "Game Informer" stated, "Even after years in development, "Soul Reaver" doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." 1UP.com ranked "Soul Reaver" second on its "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating "it's pretty clear that the plot would have been a lot different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out." GamesRadar placed "Soul Reaver" at #4 on a 2007 list of the top seven video game apocalypses, regarding the post-apocalyptic Nosgoth as "one of the most fascinating wastelands we've ever explored".
