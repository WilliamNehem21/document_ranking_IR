The settlement was extended by the development of channels circumscribing a second abutting space toward the upper east with two extra passages named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the last a characteristic door framed by two stones. This last passage was probably used to get to the space even before the formal foundation of an imperial city there, and is consequently considered by archeologists to be the most established portal at the site. After the foundation of the rova, this passageway was held for use by the sovereign, an impression of the otherworldly noteworthiness of the northeastern heading and its relationship with the predecessors, whose beatitude and "hasina" gave the premise to the sovereign's capacity and authenticity.

Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then extended toward the west to a progression of regular protections, including stony precipices and soak forested inclines that deterred the need to burrow cautious channels, and he built a few extra entryways that he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina. Andrianampoinimerina extended the channels around the city utilizing "fanampoana" work. Amid his rule, a channel was burrowed that altogether encompasses the slope, and a progression of channels was burrowed close by existing ones to additionally ensure the city against foes.
