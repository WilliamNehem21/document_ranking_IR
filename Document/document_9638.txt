"Tenebrae" happens in a world occupied by less individuals with the outcome that the rest of wealthier and less swarmed. Something has happened to make it that way yet nobody recalls, or needs to rememberÃÂ ... It isn't actually my "Edge Runner", obviously, yet in any case a stage into the universe of tomorrow. In the event that you watch the film in view of this viewpoint, it will turn out to be extremely evident."

The film commentator and creator Kim Newman countered that in staying away from an increasingly unmistakable Rome for the suburbs, Argento had prevailing with regards to giving a few pieces of the film a practically advanced sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones concurred that Argento's aim came crosswise over in these scenes, and Newman refers to the on-screen utilize a videophone as an endeavor by Argento to put "Tenebrae" soon.
