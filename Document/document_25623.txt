In the summer of 1914, when World War I broke out in Europe, the Ottomans initially remained neutral. In early November, the Black Sea Raid of the German battlecruiser "Goeben", which had been transferred to the Ottoman navy and renamed "Yavuz Sultan Selim", resulted in declarations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. By this time, "Turgut Reis" was laid up off the Golden Horn, worn out from heavy service during the Balkan Wars. Admiral , the head of the German naval mission to the Ottoman Empire, sent her and "Barbaros Hayreddin" to Nagara to support the Dardanelles forts. They remained on station from 14 to 19 December, before returning to Constantinople for repairs and gunnery training. On 18 February 1915, they departed for the Dardanelles and anchored in their firing positions. During this period, their engines were stopped to preserve fuel, but after the threat of British submarines increased, they kept steam up in their engines to preserve their ability to take evasive action; the steamer was moored in front of the battleships as a floating barrage. By 11 March, the high command decided that only one ship should be kept on station at a time, alternating every five days, to allow the ships to replenish stores and ammunition.
