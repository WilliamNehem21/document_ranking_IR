The Army experienced critical change amid Garrett's term as CGS. In March 1959, he led the principal meeting of the Military Board at the new Army Headquarters in Canberra, following its turn from Melbourne. Alan Stretton, official officer to the Military Board at the time, reviewed Garrett's comical inclination and "most casual" way. In August, the CGS declared to his senior officers an extreme revamping of the Army that would reinforce the ordinary powers and decrease dependence on the CMF, which since Federation had framed the foundation of Australia's military. This arrangement incorporated the abrogation of National Service, to which the Federal government had officially concurred, and the presentation of a "pentropic" divisional structure. Garrett supported the pentropic structure to conquer what he saw as the shortcoming of the customary force for abroad arrangements, and to guarantee similarity with the US Army's pentomic developments. The Australian Army's conventional "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry forces under a detachment home office was to be supplanted with an association comprising of five bigger units (subsequently "pentropic") without a unit layer among division and legion central command. The arrangement was restricted by CMF officers as it would result in the disbandment of the residents' detachments and huge numbers of the old volunteer army brigades. Under the new structure the CMF would not just therapist, its units would lose conventional connections to neighborhood networks through the foundation of new multi-contingent state-based regiments, prompting doubt in certain quarters that the whole procedure was intended to decimate the CMF.
