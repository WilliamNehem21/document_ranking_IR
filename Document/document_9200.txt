The principal dollar coins, known as Flowing Hair dollars, were issued by the Mint start in 1794. By 1800, a dominant part of investors mentioned their bullion be struck as silver dollars, which were then using the Draped Bust plan. This added to a lack of little change available for use, and subsequently, the open turned out to be progressively disparaging of the Mint. Mint Director Elias Boudinot started urging contributors to acknowledge fragmentary coins, and the creation of dollars started to diminish in connection to the littler coins. Dollar coin generation stopped in March 1804, despite the fact that those pieces bore the date of 1803. In his 1805 report, Mint Director Robert Patterson expressed that "[t]he striking of little coins is a measure which has been received to suit the banks and different contributors, and at their specific solicitation, both with a perspective on outfitting a supply of little change, and to keep the exportation of the specie of the United States to outside nations." Though none had been struck for more than two years, Secretary of State James Madison authoritatively suspended silver dollar coinage on May 1, 1806, tending to a letter to Patterson: Sir: In Consequence of a portrayal from the chief of the Bank of the United States that extensive buys have been made of dollars instituted at the mint to export them, and as it is likely further buys and exportations will be made the President guides that all the silver to be begat at the mint will be of little divisions, so the estimation of the biggest pieces will not surpass a large portion of a dollar.
