A 1837 article of his, focused on a discussion in regards to the interpretation of Homer's works into Romanian, included a progression of insight to more youthful scholars: "This isn't the ideal opportunity for analysis, youngsters, it is the ideal opportunity for composing, so compose to such an extent and on a par with you can, yet without unpleasantness; make, don't demolish; for the country gets and favors the creator and condemnations the destroyer. Compose with a reasonable still, small voice". Reworded as "Compose anything, young men, as long as you continue composing!" ("ScrieÃÂ£i, bÃÂieÃÂ£i, orice, numai scrieÃÂ£i!"), this statement turned into the subject of disparagement in later decades, and was hailed for instance of Heliade's inability to recognize quality and amount. The last decision was viewed as unjustifiable by the artistic antiquarian ÃÂerban Cioculescu and others, who contended that Ion Heliade RÃÂdulescu's principle objective was to support the quick improvement of nearby writing to an European dimension. In spite of the fact that he perceived, in addition to other things, Heliade's benefits of having expelled self-absorbed boyar talk from verse and having favored ordinary rhyme, Paul Zarifopol blamed him and Gheorghe Asachi for "blandness" and "artistic frailty". He explained: "RÃÂdulescu was apparently distressed with this transgression more than Asachi, given his appalling desire of manufacturing an abstract language".
