At the point when Elizabeth I moved toward becoming ruler, she requested a review of her strongholds. A 1562 report disclosed to her that just ten manors in the north of her domain merited keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further overview in 1576 revealed that, in spite of the fact that the stonework was in great condition separated from one fireplace and window, the timbers were died, the lead rooftop was brimming with openings, one kitchen was very nearly breakdown, and another required its floor supplanting. Around the same time, George Talbot, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, kept in touch with the ruler to guarantee her that the mansion was in great condition, worth ÃÂ£1,000, and could be fixed for ÃÂ£100. Since he was in charge of keeping the detained Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he would have liked to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the palace was investigated again to check whether it was reasonable to house the hostage ruler. In spite of the fact that the rooms were adequate in number and quality, the incomplete structure was considered "blemished at each corner". The extensive rooms would require subdividing, the floors were earth and mortar, and there was no cleared yard "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to stroll indirect the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth at long last chose to move Mary to Melbourne, just for the arrangement to be deserted after the Babington Plot to kill the English ruler and spot her Scottish cousin on the position of authority.
