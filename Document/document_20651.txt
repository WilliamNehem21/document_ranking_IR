As in other Eastern Bloc countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of "nationalist" or other "deviationist" tendencies. The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of Marian Spychalski from May 1950, and MichaÅ Rola-Å»ymierski five months after Stalin's death. In September 1948 WÅadysÅaw GomuÅka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like GomuÅka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from Leninism, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary. GomuÅka, accused of "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the Polish socialist traditions and severely criticized Rosa Luxemburg's Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations. More insidiously, the Soviets claimed GomuÅka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy. Following BolesÅaw Bierut's order, he was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by Roman Romkowski and Anatol Fejgin, as demanded by the Soviets. GomuÅka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, Jakub Berman and other Stalin's associates. Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal "the whole truth" if put on a trial and remained unbroken. GomuÅka was thus placed in prison without a typical show trial (he was released in December 1954). Bierut replaced GomuÅka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader. GomuÅka remained protected by his Polish comrades to the best of their ability and the record of his sometime defiance came in handy when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.
