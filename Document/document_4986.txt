The real British strike of the principal day was straightforwardly east of Arras, with the twelfth Division assaulting Observation Ridge, north of the ArrasÃ¢ÂÂCambrai street. Subsequent to achieving this target, they were to push on towards Feuchy, just as the second and third lines of German channels. In the meantime, components of the third Division started an ambush south of the street, with the taking of Devil's Wood, Tilloy-lÃÂ¨s-Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their underlying goals. A definitive goal of these attacks was the "Monchyriegel", a channel running among Wancourt and Feuchy and a critical part of the German barriers. The vast majority of these goals, including Feuchy town, had been accomplished by the night of 10 April however the Germans were still responsible for expansive areas of the channels among Wancourt and Feuchy, especially in the zone of the intensely strengthened town of Neuville-Vitasse. The next day, troops from the 56th Division had the capacity to drive the Germans out of the town, despite the fact that the "Monchyriegel" was not completely in British hands until a couple of days after the fact. The British had the capacity to merge these additions and push forward towards Monchy-le-Preux, in spite of the fact that they endured substantial setbacks in battling close to the town.
