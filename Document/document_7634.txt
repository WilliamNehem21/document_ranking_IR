In reproducing years, the uproarious blasting calls of the guys at their mating fields made it simple for MÃÂori chasing gatherings to follow the kakapo down, and it was additionally chased while sustaining or when dust-washing in dry climate. The winged animal was gotten, by and large during the evening, utilizing catches, entanglement traps, or by gatherings of trained Polynesian puppies which went with chasing parties Ã¢ÂÂ here and there they would utilize fire sticks of different sorts to stun a fowl in the haziness, leaving it speechless and making the catch simpler. Cooking was done in a hÃÂngi or in gourds of bubbling oil. The substance of the flying creature could be safeguarded in its own fat and put away in holders for later utilization Ã¢ÂÂ seekers of the NgÃÂi Tahu clan would pack the tissue in bins produced using the internal bark of totara tree or in compartments developed from kelp. Groups of kakapo tail quills were connected to the sides of these holders to give enrichment and an approach to recognize their substance. Additionally taken by the MÃÂori were the feathered creature's eggs, which are portrayed as whitish "yet not unadulterated white", and about a similar size as a kererÃÂ« egg.
