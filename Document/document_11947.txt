After some time aground every one of the three came back to ocean in a vessel they had by and by picked, an old, battered tramp steamer named SS "Vittoria". Renaming it , they furnished their vessel with a firearm, two twelve pounders, two automatic rifles, torpedo cylinders and profundity charges.

One negligible officer was executed and a number injured.
