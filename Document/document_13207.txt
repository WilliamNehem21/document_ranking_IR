Looking for awesome support, and reacting to iconophile plots against him, Theophilos reestablished dynamic concealment of the iconophiles and other saw "apostates" in June 833, including mass captures and outcasts, beatings and appropriations of property. In Byzantine eyes, God appeared to be in reality to remunerate this choice: al-Ma'mun kicked the bucket amid the principal phases of another, vast scale intrusion against Byzantium that was proposed to be simply the initial phase in vanquishing Constantinople, and his sibling and successor al-Mu'tasim pulled back to concentrate on interior issues, experiencing difficulty building up his power, and expecting to stand up to the progressing defiance of the Khurramite religious order under Babak Khorramdin. This permitted Theophilos to accomplish a progression of unobtrusive triumphs throughout the following couple of years, just as to support his powers with somewhere in the range of 14,000 Khurramite exiles under their pioneer Nasr, who was absolved a Christian and took the name Theophobos. The sovereign's victories were not especially marvelous, yet coming following two many years of thrashings and common war under iconophile heads, Theophilos felt defended in asserting them as vindication for his religious strategy. Thusly, the head started to freely connect himself with the memory of the militarily fruitful and fanatically heathen sovereign Constantine V (r. 741Ã¢ÂÂ 775), and issued another sort of the copper "follis" coin, printed in enormous numbers, which depicted him as the prototype successful Roman ruler.
