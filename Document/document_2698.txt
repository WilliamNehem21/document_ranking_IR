After the agreement among Nintendo and Sony to create the extra fizzled, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the contending PlayStation comfort, Square adjusted the amusement for the SNES cartridge design. The amusement must be changed to fit the extra room of a SNES diversion cartridge, which is a lot littler than that of a CD-ROM. The engineers at first opposed proceeding with the venture without the CD add-on, trusting that a lot of the amusement would need to be cut, yet they were overruled by organization the executives. Because of the equipment change, a few highlights must be cut from the diversion, and some finished work should have been revamped.

The plot that remained was not quite the same as the first origination, and Tanaka has said that the first story had an a lot darker tone. Ishii has evaluated that up to 40% of the arranged amusement was dropped to meet the space restrictions, and commentators have recommended that the equipment change prompted specialized issues when an excessive amount of occurs without a moment's delay in the diversion.
