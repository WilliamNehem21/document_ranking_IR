Just a single hostage populace of brilliant delegated sifakas has been spoken to in a zoological accumulation. Expanding on a fruitful record of keeping up a practical hostage Verreaux's sifaka populace, the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina, mentioned and got authorization from the legislature of Madagascar to catch and fare this (at that point) obscure species for hostage rearing. Plans were additionally made to build up a hostage reproducing program at the Ivoloina Forestry Station, presently known as Parc Ivoloina. In November 1987, amid a similar campaign that brought about the formal portrayal of the species, two guys and two females were gotten and estimated. Five others were additionally gotten, yet were discharged in light of the fact that they were adolescent guys. In July 1988, a brilliant delegated sifaka was conceived in imprisonment at the DLC. In any case, the hostage populace was little and not practical for long haul rearing, and hostage sifakas have demonstrated hard to keep up because of their specific dietary needs. The last hostage individual passed on in 2008. Notwithstanding the loss of its little state following 20 years, DLC trusts that foundation of a hostage populace for preservation arranged hostage rearing purposes could give an essential second dimension of security, especially if environment insurance measures are ineffective.
