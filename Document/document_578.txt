Once Feuillaucourt had fallen, the 24th Battalion proceeded to the PÃÂ©ronne street. In any case, the Germans had involved a brush of trees and set up solid obstruction, stopping the development. German troops were watched massing for a counter-assault, so Towner pushed ahead with a few of his men, two Vickers weapons, and the caught German firearm, and brought the gathering Germans under concentrated discharge, exacting numerous losses. Endeavoring to resign, a gathering of twenty-five German officers were cut off by Towner's weapons and taken prisoner. Under overwhelming approaching discharge, Towner at that point explored over open territory to find worthwhile positions from which his firearms could offer further help. When he pushed his area ahead, the heavy armament specialists had the capacity to connect more gatherings of German troopers; their forceful activity empowered the development to be reestablished, and the regiment accomplished the front of an indented segment of the PÃÂ©ronne street. Be that as it may, on rejoining them Towner found that his area was developing shy of ammo, so he advanced back over the discharge cleared ground and found a German assault rifle, which he presented alongside a few boxes of ammo. This he brought enthusiastically "in full perspective on the foe"; his viable flame constrained the Germans to resign further, and permitted one of the slowed down Australian flanks to push ahead.
