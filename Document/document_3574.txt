In March 2013, official maker Adi Shankar said that a spin-off was improbable. In May 2013, Urban said that a spin-off was as yet conceivable, noticing that the film had discovered a crowd of people, and the reaction of fans could revive the undertaking. "Dredd" fans on Facebook propelled a request requiring a continuation. In July 2013, "2000 AD" embraced the fan appeal, supporting the crusade by printing ads in their productions, and by September 2013 it had pulled in more than 80,000 marks. In April 2013, "2000 AD" discharged a picture prodding a continuation of the film in comic book structure with a discharge date planned for September 2013. The comic, titled "Dredd: Underbelly", was made accessible in "Judge Dredd Megazine" #340 which was discharged on 18 September 2013. In October 2014, Shankar reported the creation of an informal spinoff online arrangement dependent on the Dark Judges that would be discharged soon thereafter. The energized miniseries was titled "Judge Dredd: Superfiend" and all its six scenes were discharged on 27 October 2014 on YouTube. In March 2015, Garland said that an immediate continuation would likely not occur sooner rather than later, at any rate not with the team associated with the first film.
