On July 12 a supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern New Jersey in association with a surface low-pressure area in southwestern Ontario. Daytime heating in the Tri-State Region led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of showers and thunderstorms. With conditions favorable for the development of a tornado, the Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 12:40Â p.m.Â EDT (16:40Â UTC). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00Â p.m.Â EDT (18:00Â UTC) which produced a funnel cloud near Carlstadt at around 2:45Â p.m.Â EDT (18:45Â UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into New York. About 15Â minutes later, a tornado warning was issued for southern Rockland and Westchester counties which would remain in effect until 4:15Â p.m.Â EDT (21:15Â UTC). At around 3:30Â p.m.Â EDT (19:30Â UTC), an F1 tornado touched down near Grand View-on-Hudson along the Hudson River in Rockland County. The 100Â yard (91Â m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a waterspout as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the Tappan Zee Bridge before crossing into Westchester County. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.
