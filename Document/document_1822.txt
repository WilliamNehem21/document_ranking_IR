The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804Ã¢ÂÂ 1806) passed well north of the Grand Teton district. Amid their arrival trip from the Pacific Ocean, endeavor part John Colter was given an early release so he could join two hide trappers who were traveling west looking for beaver pelts. Colter was later procured by Manuel Lisa to lead hide trappers and to investigate the area around the Yellowstone River. Amid the winter of 1807/08 Colter went through Jackson Hole and was the primary Caucasian to see the Teton Range. Lewis and Clark endeavor co-pioneer William Clark created a guide dependent on the past campaign and incorporated the investigations of John Colter in 1807, obviously dependent on discourses among Clark and Colter when the two met in St. Louis, Missouri in 1810. Another guide ascribed to William Clark demonstrates John Colter entered Jackson Hole from the upper east, crossing the Continental Divide at either Togwotee Pass or Union Pass and left the area in the wake of intersection Teton Pass, following the settled Native American trails. In 1931, the Colter Stone, a stone cut in the state of a head with the engraving "John Colter" on one side and the year "1808" on the other, was found in a field in Tetonia, Idaho, which is west of Teton Pass. The Colter Stone has not been verified to have been made by John Colter and may have been crafted by later campaigns to the locale.
