In March 1998 the Crime Commission discharged its discoveries, expressing that the wrongdoings that brought about feelings happened generously in the route depicted to the courts, that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the homicide and the strike that quickly gone before it, and that police had not acted improperly in their choice not to charge different people. It did, be that as it may, censure some police systems and practices. The survey did not remark on the inconsistencies between Webster's admission and the legal proof, and it didn't illuminate whether scientific proof was ever sent for testing. An agent for the Commission would not remark on whether Wilson's blood-recolored shirt was ever tried. One master assessment gotten by the Commission composed that it was "likely [Webster] occupied with sexual conduct which belittled Leigh and to which he will never concede in light of the fact that he is embarrassed and humiliated", and Dr Johan Duflou said that a finger or penis was probably not going to have caused Leigh's extreme genital harm. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong expressed that these master assessments, which negate Webster's admission, brought up issues on how the Commission reasoned that Leigh's rape happened in the way to which he had admitted, additionally raising questions around a few of the Commission's different discoveries. The Crime Commission discharged one of their two reports on the issue; their second unpublished report was given over to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) for examination.
