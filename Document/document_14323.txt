Damon Wise of "Realm" called "Changeling" "faultless", and McCarthy said it was "candidly amazing and elaborately beyond any doubt gave". He expressed that "Changeling" was a more intricate and wide-running work than Eastwood's "Spiritualist River", saying the characters and social editorial were carried into the story with a "practically amazing consultation". He said that as "a pitiful investigate of the city's political culture", "Changeling" sat in the organization of movies, for example, "Chinatown" and "L.A. Secret". Honeycutt said the film included an "overlooked part to the L.A. noir" of those movies, and that Eastwood's melodic score added to an inspiration of a city and a period "experiencing galvanic changes". Honeycutt stated, "[the] community feel to the road and setsÃÂ ... catches a general public impervious to seeing what is truly going on". SÃÂ©guret said that while "Changeling" had few imperfections, it was bewildering that different commentators had such unrestrained acclaim for it. Denby said it was perfectly made, however that it shared the main blame of other "honestly angry" films in complimenting the crowd for inclination hatred for the "since a long time ago ruined" demeanors delineated. Ansen presumed that the story was told in such a beyond any doubt way, that just a solidified skeptic would be left unaffected by the "eerie, troubled adventure".
