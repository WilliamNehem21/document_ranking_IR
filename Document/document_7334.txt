In 1965, a $1.46 million (about $ in dollars) contract was conceded to construct the part from close Araby Road east through Fortuna Wash. After two years, it was evaluated that development would be finished by 1969, aside from the Colorado River connect. The thruway was in advancement through the Telegraph Pass east of Yuma, and the parts from Avenue 9-E to 4-E, from that point to fourth Street in Yuma, and to the waterway were evaluated to cost $9.69 million (about $ in dollars) altogether. Following neighborhood grievances, Francis Turner, the official executive of the government Bureau of Public Roads, consented to take a gander at developing a trade at Trekell Road in Casa Grande once more, after a prior decrease to do as such. Work started on the Casa Grande part of the interstate in March 1968, at an expense of $3 million (about $ in dollars). That year, numerous service station, motel, and eatery proprietors saw a drop in business, conceivably because of concerns with respect to development traffic because of I-8; in any case, they sought after expanded business following fulfillment of the interstate. The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce made arrangements to advance the travel industry in the town following the finishing of I-8 by late 1968.
