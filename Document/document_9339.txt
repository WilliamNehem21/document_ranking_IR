Following Ben Silverman was named co-director of NBC's diversion division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels to make a turn off of "The Office", the half-hour parody Daniels adjusted from the British satire of a similar name, made by Ricky Gervais. The possibility of an "Office" turn off originated from a subplot from the show's third season that pursued characters in an office branch in Stamford, Connecticut, separate from the show's different characters, who were in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Silverman felt it could have filled in as its own arrangement and started getting some information about the likelihood of a spinoff. Daniels opposed the thought for quite a long while out of fears of diltuing the nature of "The Office", however Silverman in the long run demanded another show. Daniels co-made "Parks and Recreation" with Michael Schur, who had been an author on "The Office". Like Daniels, Schur had recently taken a shot at the NBC sketch parody show "Saturday Night Live". The two invested months thinking about thoughts for the new arrangement and discussing whether to make it an independent show as opposed to a turn off, with a significant number of those discussions occurring at Norm's Diner in Van Nuys.
