Lynch had at first started work on a content titled "Gardenback", in light of his artistic creation of a slouched figure with vegetation developing from its back. "Gardenback" was a surrealist content about infidelity, which included a consistently developing bug speaking to one man's desire for his neighbor. The content would have brought about an approximately 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was unreasonably long for such an allegorical, nonlinear content. In its place, Lynch exhibited "Eraserhead", which he had created dependent on a fantasy of a man's head being taken to a pencil manufacturing plant by a little kid. A few board individuals at the AFI were as yet contradicted to creating such a surrealist work, however they assented when Dean Frank Daniel took steps to leave if it somehow managed to be vetoed. Lynch's content for "Eraserhead" was affected by his perusing as a film understudy; Franz Kafka's 1915 novella "The Metamorphosis" and Nikolai Gogol's 1836 short story "The Nose" were solid impacts on the screenplay. Lynch additionally affirmed in a meeting with "Metro Silicon Valley" that the film "met up" when he opened up a Bible, read one section from it, and shut it; everything considered, Lynch couldn't recollect whether the refrain was from the Old Testament or the New Testament. In 2007, Lynch said "Trust it or not, "Eraserhead" is my most otherworldly film."
