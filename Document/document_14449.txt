The majority of the Southern Rhodesian press anticipated that Smith would not keep going long; one segment called him "a fleeting man", push into the spotlight by the RF's lack of demonstrated pioneers. His solitary genuine adversary to supplant Field had been William Harper, an impassioned segregationist who hosted headed the Dominion Gathering's Southern Rhodesian branch amid the Federal years. A few journalists anticipated Welensky's approaching prologue to Southern Rhodesian legislative issues at the leader of a RFÃ¢ÂÂ UFP alliance government, however Welensky demonstrated little enthusiasm for this thought, saying he would be unfit to move in a RF-commanded House. The RF's supplanting of Field with Smith drew analysis from the British Labor pioneer Harold Wilson, who called it "merciless", while JÃÂ B Johnston, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, showed his objection by declining to meet Smith for about fourteen days after he got down to business. The ZAPU pioneer Joshua Nkomo marked the new Smith Cabinet "a suicide squadÃÂ ... intrigued not in the welfare of the considerable number of individuals but rather just in their own", and anticipated that the RF would "in the long run wreck themselves". Declaring that an enduring "place for the white man" in Southern Rhodesia would profit the majority of the nation's kin, the new Prime Minister said the legislature ought to be based "on legitimacy, not on shading or patriotism", and demanded that there would be "no African patriot government here in my lifetime".
