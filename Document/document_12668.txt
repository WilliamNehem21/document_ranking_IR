Jason Kaufman, a Harvard teacher who shows the human science of culture, composed that MOBA is a piece of a social pattern he calls "annoyism", where broad communications scenes advance exhibitions and craftsmen who blend the purposely terrible with the sharp. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to typify this pattern, and further represents its focal intend to deride the judgment framework by which individuals distinguish what is awful based on what isn't. For Kaufman, "The excellence of MOBAÃ¢ÂÂhowever magnificence is most likely the wrong wordÃ¢ÂÂis the manner in which it undermines stylish criteria from various edges." Amy Levin, depicting how American history and culture have been formed by little nearby exhibition halls, recommends that MOBA is a farce of workmanship itself, and that MOBA's editorial, pamphlet, site, and distributions mock historical centers as experts on what is great craftsmanship. The executive of the Ellipse Arts Center, a display in Arlington, Virginia, that facilitated a voyaging show of MOBA works, was bewildered to see individuals' extravagant chuckling in light of the fact that nobody visiting the Ellipse had ever reacted to workmanship along these lines. She watched, "On the off chance that I didn't have a sign on the entryway, individuals probably won't believe it's so terrible. Who's to state what's terrible and what's great?"
