In 1962, HMV influenced Barbirolli to return. With the HallÃÂ© he recorded a Sibelius ensemble cycle, Elgar's Second Symphony, "Falstaff" and "The Dream of Gerontius", Schubert's Ninth Symphony, Vaughan Williams' "A London Symphony", and works by Grieg and Delius. With different ensembles, Barbirolli recorded a wide scope of his collection, incorporating numerous accounts still in the inventories in 2012. Of these, his Elgar chronicles incorporate the Cello Concerto with Jacqueline du PrÃÂ©, "Ocean Pictures" with Janet Baker, and instrumental music including the First Symphony, "Puzzler Variations" and a significant number of the shorter works. His Mahler chronicles incorporate the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies (with the New Philharmonia) and Ninth Symphony (with the Berlin Philharmonic). With the Vienna Philharmonic, he recorded a Brahms orchestra cycle, and with Daniel Barenboim, the two Brahms Piano Concertos. He made three operatic sets for HMV: Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas" with Victoria de los ÃÂngeles (1966), Verdi's "Otello" with James McCracken, Gwyneth Jones and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (1969), and a lot of "Madama Butterfly" with Renata Scotto, Carlo Bergonzi and Rome Opera powers that has stayed in the inventories since its first issue in 1967. The effect of the latter was to such an extent that the leader of the Rome Opera welcomed him to come and direct "any musical show you want to name with as much practice as you wish." HMV intended to record "Pass on Meistersinger" with Barbirolli in Dresden in 1970, however following the Warsaw Pact intrusion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 he would not lead in the Soviet alliance, and his place was taken by Herbert von Karajan.
