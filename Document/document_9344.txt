The top of "Dendrocollybia racemosa" is commonly between in distance across, and relying upon its phase of improvement, might be conic to raised, or in development, to some degree leveled with a slight adjusted focal rise (an umbo). The top surface is dry and obscure, with a sleek surface; its shading in the inside is fuscous (a dim caramel dim shading), yet the shading blurs consistently towards the edge. The edge is generally bended toward the gills at first; as the natural product body develops the edge may take off to some degree, yet it likewise tends to shred or part with age. There might be shallow notches on the top that compare to the situation of the gills underneath, which may give the top edge a crenate (scalloped) appearance. The tissue is exceptionally slight (under 1ÃÂ mm thick) and delicate, ailing in shading, and has no particular scent or taste. The gills are generally expansive, barely joined to the stem (adnexed), divided firmly together, and hued dim to grayish-tan, to some degree darker than the top. There are extra gills, called "lamellulae", that don't stretch out right to the stem; they are blended between the gills and masterminded in up to three arrangement (levels) of equivalent length. Every so often, the organism produces stems with prematurely ended tops, or with the tops missing altogether.
