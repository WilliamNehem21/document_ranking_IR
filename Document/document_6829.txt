"The Everglades: River of Grass" excited individuals to secure the Everglades and has been contrasted with Rachel Carson's 1962 confession of the destructive impacts of DDT, "Quiet Spring"; the two books are "earth shattering suggestions to take action that made residents and legislators pay heed". Its effect is still felt as it is professed to be a noteworthy reason Florida gets such a significant number of travelers, and "remains the authoritative reference on the predicament of the Florida Everglades". It has experienced various releases, selling 500,000ÃÂ copies since its unique distribution. The "Christian Science Monitor" composed of it in 1997, "Today her book isn't just a great of natural writing, it likewise peruses like a diagram for what protectionists are hailing as the most broad ecological reclamation venture at any point attempted anyplace on the planet". The drawback of the book's effect, as indicated by one essayist tending to reclamation of the Everglades, is that her allegory of a River of Grass is predominant to the point that the unpredictable trap of biological systems inside the Everglades is distorted. David McCally composed that regardless of Douglas' "energy about the multifaceted nature of the ecological framework" she portrayed, prominent origination of the Everglades shared by individuals who have not perused the book dominates her definite clarifications.
