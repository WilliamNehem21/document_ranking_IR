In 1161 Chesney ended up involved in a debate with St Albans Abbey, coming about because of his endeavors to uphold his right, as cleric, to direct religious houses inside his see. Despite the fact that Pope Alexander III sent an ecclesiastical bull to England requesting the case to be heard by a board of two priests, King Henry II felt that the ecclesiastical request encroached on his regal rights and had the case chosen at the imperial court. In 1155Ã¢ÂÂ 1156 St Albans had verified ecclesiastical benefits from the English Pope Adrian IV, who had recently been a priest there, that exempted the convent from diocesan supervision, and it was these benefits that Chesney tested. Chesney verified the ecclesiastical bull as well as a regal commission to examine the privileges of the convent as they were in the season of King Henry I. The last mien of the case occurred in 1163, at a regal chamber at Westminster, where the nunnery created both the ecclesiastical benefits and a manufactured contract of Offa of Mercia in help of their case. As Chesney was unfit to deliver any records in help of his own position, the ruler and chamber told the diocesan that they supported the monastery's motivation. The ruler additionally decided that the monastery was an illustrious exclusive church, and consequently had extraordinary exceptions. At last, a trade off was come to, whereby the convent repaid the precinct with some land as an end-result of the diocesan disavowing his cases.
