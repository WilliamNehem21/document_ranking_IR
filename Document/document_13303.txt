Viking metal has been viewed as the forebear of the agnostic metal class, with Bathory's "Hammerheart" as the primary agnostic metal account. Weinstein composes that "it is fitting that agnostic metal started with Viking metal, given that the Vikings were Europe's last Pagans, changed over gradually and with hesitance to Christianity". Be that as it may, there are some key contrasts, as Imke von Helden clarifies: "[Pagan metal] manages Pagan religions and lies in a more extensive setting where Old Norse folklore is managed, yet in addition Celtic fantasies and history, fantasies and different components of old stories. Conventional instruments like the violin or woodwind are utilized more frequently in agnostic than in Viking metal music." fusing and venerating solely national or territorial fantasies, stories, and stories previously flourished in crafted by specialists, for example, Adorned Brood, Falkenbach, Black Messiah, Enslaved or Einherjer, be that as it may, as a melodic wonder, has become a long ways past Europe into a worldwide pattern in which craftsmen express their partiality with an ethnic legacy. Viking metal, alongside agnostic and society metal, frames some portion of a pattern inside social legacy developments toward more extensive acknowledgment of the legacy of common and the regular day to day existence, not simply broadly huge and the notorious symbolism, and furthermore a pattern to investigate the external scopes of legacy, where the meanings of legacy and legacy networks are extended and challenged.
