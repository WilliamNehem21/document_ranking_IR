"Persoonia levis" develops as a tall bush to little tree, and can achieve 5ÃÂ m (16ÃÂ ft) in stature. The flaky delicate bark is dim superficially, while more profound layers are ruddy in shading. Inside the bark are epicormic buds, which grow new development after bushfire. The new development is smooth to somewhat shaggy. The substantial green leaves measure 6 to 14ÃÂ cm (2.2Ã¢ÂÂ 5.5ÃÂ in) long, and 1.3 to 8ÃÂ cm (0.5Ã¢ÂÂ 3.2ÃÂ in) in width, and are oval or sickle-formed (falcate). The uneven shape recognizes the species from "P.ÃÂ lanceolata". The brilliant green foliage, especially of new development, emerges against the more quelled tones of the encompassing vegetation and the stems, which are ruddy in shading. The yellow blooms show up in summer and fall (December to April), and top over December to February. They are organized on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Every individual blossom comprises of a tube shaped perianth, comprising of tepals melded for a large portion of their length, inside which are both male and female parts. The focal style is encompassed by the anther, which parts into four fragments; these twist back and look like a cross when seen from above. They give an arrival territory to creepy crawlies taking care of the shame, which is situated at the tip of the style. The smooth plump organic product, known as a drupe, is green and pretty much round, estimating 1ÃÂ cm (0.4ÃÂ in) by 0.8ÃÂ cm (0.3ÃÂ in) in width. It contains two seeds, and has a spike toward the end. The drupe is succulent yet stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are unpalatable.
