With the withdrawal of "Big business" toward the beginning of May, "Saratoga" turned into the main operational American armada bearer in the South Pacific. Team 14, as her gathering was currently known, was fortified by the counter flying machine cruiser on 3 May and by the British armada transporter on 17 May. As of now Saratoga left 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's power was expected to give inaccessible spread to the approaching arrivals on New Georgia and to anticipate intercession by any Japanese transporters. The two bearers put in certain weeks acclimating each other with their capacities and strategies and Ramsey chose to exploit every transporter's qualities. He requested that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be traded for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as "Triumphant" experienced issues working the substantial Avenger and the British transporter would do well to offices for organizing contender tasks than "Saratoga"; the last held twelve Wildcats for self-preservation and escort obligations. Luckily, Ramsey never got an opportunity to test his rearrangement as the Japanese bearers endeavored to assault the American transports. Ramsey was alleviated on 26 July and supplanted by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. "Triumphant" cruised on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as stores for "Saratoga".
