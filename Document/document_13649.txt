In spite of the fact that Howarth knew about grounds club life while going to George Washington University, he didn't base Todd or his different jobs on anybody he knew. At the point when gotten some information about his jobs, he was unfit to clarify why he was reliably given a role as a miscreant, yet said that he delighted in it. "I could never need to come in now and play a pleasant person for three months. That would be appallingly exhausting. This suits me fine. It's similarly as simple to imagine I'm a trouble maker for what it's worth to imagine I'm a hero," Howarth said. Playing an attacker resembled assuming some other job on the grounds that "[he knows] it's everything pretend". He was bewildered by authors' have to reclaim miscreants. "Todd's a quite fascinating character only the manner in which he is," Howarth said in late 1994. "There's no compelling reason to fix it if it's not broken. I don't have a clue where the entire idea of reclaiming characters originates from. Individuals used to state to me, 'I trust you get recovered so you can remain on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been reclaimed, he's still on the show." He included, "I don't love the character I play. On the off chance that I met Todd in the city, I wouldn't state 'Howdy' to him, yet I do love playing this character."
