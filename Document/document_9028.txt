All duplicates of "Song" are found in compositions of the "Historia ecclesiastica" or its interpretation, where they fill in as either a shine to Bede's Latin interpretation of the Old English sonnet, or, on account of the Old English form, a swap for Bede's interpretation in the principle content of the History. Regardless of this nearby association with Bede's work, the "Song" does not seem to have been transmitted with the "Historia ecclesiastica" normally until moderately late in its printed history. Recorders other than those in charge of the fundamental content regularly duplicate the vernacular content of the "Song" in original copies of the Latin Historia. In three cases, "Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243", "Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43", and "Winchester, Cathedral I", the lyric is replicated by copyists working 25 years or progressively after the primary content was first set down. Notwithstanding when the ballad is in a similar hand as the composition's primary content, there is little proof to recommend that it was replicated from a similar model as the Latin "Historia": almost indistinguishable variants of the Old English sonnet are found in original copies having a place with various recensions of the Latin content; firmly related duplicates of the Latin "Historia" once in a while contain altogether different forms of the Old English lyric. Except for the Old English interpretation, no single recension of the "Historia ecclesiastica" is portrayed by the nearness of a specific recension of the vernacular lyric.
