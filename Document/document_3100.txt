"New York Dolls" was blended in under a large portion of multi day. Rundgren felt the band appeared to be diverted and uninvolved by then, so he attempted fruitlessly to forbid them from the blending session. For the last blend, he limited the sound of Nolan's drumming. Everything considered, Rundgren said the nature of the blend was poor in light of the fact that the band had rushed and addressed him while blending the record: "It's unreasonably simple for it to turn into a free-for-all, with each artist just hearing their very own part and not the entirety. They all had different spots to be, so as opposed to part, they hurried the thing and if that wasn't sufficient they took it to the horrible acing lab that Mercury had placed them in." Thunders broadly whined to a columnist that Rundgren "messed up the blend" on "New York Dolls", adding to stories that the two had conflicted amid the collection's account. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they didn't perceive any contention between the two and that Thunders' ordinarily absurd conduct was confounded. Johansen later applauded Rundgren for how he improved and evened out each instrument, giving audience members the feeling that "[they're] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his blend precisely caught how the band sounded live.
