The spore print is olive-dark colored to pale cinnamon-darker. Singular spores are slender walled, hyaline (translucent), and smooth. Their shape is ellipsoid to generally round and hollow in face see or inequilateral when seen in profile, and they measure 9.5Ã¢ÂÂ 10 by 2.8Ã¢ÂÂ 3.5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are hyaline, club-formed and four-spored, with measurements of 33Ã¢ÂÂ 36 by 8Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. The slender walled cystidia are uncommon to dissipated on the cylinder surface however plenteous on the pores, where they for the most part happen in gigantic bunches. They seem dim dark colored when mounted in a weaken (3%) arrangement of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and are cylindric to generally club-molded, estimating 43Ã¢ÂÂ 79 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. They are generally encrusted with color, albeit some might be hyaline. The tissue including the cylinder is hyaline, and made of disparate to about parallel hyphae that are 3Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m wide. The pileipellis is a tissue type known as an ixotrichodermium (made of intertwined gelatinized hyphae); it stains dark colored in KOH, and is made of hyphae that are 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m wide. The stipe fingernail skin is made of groups of cystidia like those found in the hymenium. Clip associations are missing in the hyphae of "S.ÃÂ pungens".
