Harrison challenged that the purported Oxford structural custom was an obscure idea and furthermore a mishap of history: there was no uniform style joining the structures of the college and schools, however rather unique plans had been utilized, with changing adjustments, over numerous hundreds of years. Just a trade off would suit "a twentieth century giver with a mechanical foundation who murmurs for sentiment, a board of trustees of financial specialists who are after outcomes [and] the administering advisory group of a University saturated with its custom". By and by, Harrison consented to endeavor to fulfill Nuffield's craving for "something on the lines of Cotswold local engineering", and created a second plan. The measure of convenience gave was decreased. The fundamental passage was moved from the west toward the south of the school, under the sanctuary; it was to have an arcaded vestibule, enabling the quadrangle to be seen from the road, as Nuffield needed. The level rooftops were supplanted with pitched rooftops with peak finishes and dormer windows. The staircase prompting the corridor was expelled, and the lobby repositioned on ground level, without paths however with a hammerbeam top of oak supports. The pinnacle, which would now contain the basic room, was moved from the region of the previous lobby staircase toward the east end of the house of prayer. At the point when the plans were appeared to Nuffield in mid 1940, the main change that he mentioned before giving his endorsement was for a "progressively ordinary" tower to supplant the tower on Harrison's structure.
