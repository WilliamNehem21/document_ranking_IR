At the point when the collection was reissued, Rihanna drew closer L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and recommended that she needed to discharge "Disturbia" as the following single. Addressing MTV News, Reid stated, "It was the first run through Rihanna really came to me and stated, 'Here's the tune I need to put out.' She played me the melody. That was her taking control [...] She comprehends what hits are, and she recognizes what she needs to state. She's at that place where she can do that." It was requested to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was discharged as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. "Disturbia" earned Rihanna an honor for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It crested at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and turned into a main ten hit in more than twenty nations around the world. The single beat the US "Bulletin" Hot 100 graph for two sequential weeks, and turned into Rihanna's third number one single from "Great Girl Gone Bad" and fourth by and large on the Hot 100 diagram. The music video for "Disturbia" was coordinated by Anthony Mandler and depicts Rihanna in different areas, for example, in a jail cell and gas chamber.
