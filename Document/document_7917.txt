On 26 July 1945 the Labor Party won an avalanche triumph on a proclamation that included bringing key ventures into open control, and on 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway turned into the Southern Region of the freely possessed British Railways. Albeit still precious for the vehicle of mass products, the utilization of railroads in the region fell pointedly after the war. The nullification of petroleum proportioning in 1950 made the vehicle definitely more down to earth than it had been, and the area of Droxford station between the two towns implied that it was badly designed for both. Railroad stations and moving stock had experienced poor support since the episode of war; trains were moderate and messy, and there was an expanding number of prominent railroad mishaps. To address the decay, benefits on the Meon Valley Railway were definitely cut. Products charges were expanded, Sunday administrations were rejected, and weekday traveler administration was diminished to four trains for every day toward every path with the last train leaving Alton at 4.30ÃÂ pm, making day return travel to London outlandish. At this point Droxford never again had its very own stationmaster, and the stationmaster of close-by Wickham was in ostensible accuse of the station of Reg Daniels, Droxford's senior watchman, in charge of its organization.
