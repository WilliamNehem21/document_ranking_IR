As indicated by Saadiq, "Only One Kiss" can be translated as a tune gave to a female love intrigue, "yet I'm truly discussing music and what it accomplished for me. That one guitar line, that specific drum beat, how it transformed my life into a bundle of gold." The melody fuses true to life strings, xylophone, and a moving crescendo. The song "Calling", including Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R&B roots and doo-wop music, and fuses Latin style guitar, and Spanish language verses. "Remaining in Love", an uptempo cadence and blues tune, was composed by Saadiq after he thought of an ex. Unintelligible with its 1960s-roused sound, "How about we Take a Walk" has explicitly forward verses and come-ons, which the storyteller uses to obtusely suggestion his affection intrigue. The midtempo "Never Give You Up" is formed in Motown's mid 1970 sound and, in contrast to different melodies on the collection, additionally consolidates components from progressively present day soul music. "Once in a while", which was motivated by Saadiq's childhood in an extreme neighborhood in Oakland, is tied in with managing the weakness of widespread hardships when they are intensified by the weight of prejudice. The line "now I realize what they implied by 'hold your head to the sky'" makes reference to Earth, Wind and Fire, whose music Saadiq drenched himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the tune's message, "That is simply offering dap to my mothers and grandma and the general population who brought me up in the area to tell them its simple however not as simple as it appears to be constantly and here and there we need to back up and cry yet I'm simply expressing appreciation to the general population that helped me en route."
