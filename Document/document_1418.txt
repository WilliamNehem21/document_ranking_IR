Nesbitt had been drawn nearer at a British Academy Television Awards function by executive Paul Greengrass, who needed him to star in a TV show he was making about the 1972 "Bleeding Sunday" shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was just seven years of age when the shootings occurred and was uninformed of its motivation; he trusted that there was "no smoke without flame" and that the Catholic marchers more likely than not accomplished something to incite the British Army. He was shooting "Cold Feet" in Manchester when he got the content. He read it and found that had "a remarkable impact" on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in "Ridiculous Sunday", the man who squeezed for the walk to proceed. To get ready for the job, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent numerous hours conversing with him about his intentions on that day. He met with relatives of the people in question and watched the broadcast Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and furthermore perused Don Mullan's "Observer Bloody Sunday" and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's "Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?". Greengrass contrasted Nesbitt's planning with a competitor getting ready for a race, and told "The Observer", "For an Irish on-screen character, doing the Troubles resembles doing "Lear"." Nesbitt had addressed whether he was an adequate performing artist to successfully depict Cooper and was stressed what Derry Catholics would think about a Protestant playing the lead, in spite of the fact that Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.
