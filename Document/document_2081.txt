In the mid thirteenth century, twelfth century qualities stayed noticeable; in any case, numerous parts that were once in the past plain ended up designed. This change is seen in the Muktesvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri locale. The Muktesvara Temple with its exquisite "vimana" was revamped amidst the thirteenth century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the engineering parts are lengthened, giving it a proposed swarmed look. The two sanctuaries are worked with a "dravida" explanation. Aside from colorful "dravida" explanations, a few sanctuaries of this period have "nagara" enunciation, worked in the ventured precious stone and the square arrangement regular to a "nagara" superstructure. Outstanding among sanctuaries with a ventured precious stone style are the Ganesha Temple at Hangal, the Banashankari sanctuary at Amargol (which has one "dravida" holy place and one "nagara" sanctum), and a little hallowed place that is a piece of the group at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the engineers had the capacity to give a "sekhari" superstructure to the place of worship, while the lower half got a "nagara" verbalization and delineations of small scale "sekhari" towers. The style of workmanship with a square arrangement is found at Muttagi and the Kamala Narayana Temple at Degoan.
