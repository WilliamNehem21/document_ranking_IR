Obscure to the Franciscans, the northern ChakÃÂ¼an Itza area of the Itza kingdom was aligned with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza ruler. The ChakÃÂ¼an Itzas stole away the vast majority of the endowments that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza lord, with an end goal to prevent neighborly relations creating. The next day, the current Aj Kan EkÃÂ¼ traversed the lake with eighty kayaks to welcome the guests at the ChakÃÂ¼an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake PetÃÂ©n Itza. The Franciscans came back to NojpetÃÂ©n with Kan EkÃÂ¼ and sanctified through water more than 300 Itza kids over the accompanying four days. AvendaÃÂ±o endeavored to persuade Kan EkÃÂ¼ to change over to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without progress. The Franciscan monk attempted to persuade the Itza lord that the KÃÂ¼atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle starting in 1696 or 1697, was the correct time for the Itza to at long last grasp Christianity and to acknowledge the ruler of Spain as overlord. The lord of the Itza, similar to his ancestor, refered to Itza prediction and said the time was not yet right. He requested that the Spanish return in four months, at which time the Itza would change over and swear fealty to the King of Spain.
