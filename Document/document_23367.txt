In 1950, Ba Cá»¥t was involved in a battle with another HÃ²a Háº£o leader, Nguyá»n GiÃ¡c Ngá». He was defeated and driven from the district of Chá»£ Má»i in February, provoking SoÃ¡i to attack Ngo. Ba Cá»¥t then moved to Thá»t Ná»t and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the HÃ²a Háº£o and gain an anti-Viá»t Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cá»¥t accepted. Ba Cá»¥t repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Viá»t Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao ÄÃ i instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cá»¥t sometimes broke away with the encouragement of SoÃ¡i, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cá»¥t weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cá»¥t's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other HÃ²a Háº£o commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cá»¥t; they were stridently opposed to the Viá»t Minh due to Sá»'s assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.
