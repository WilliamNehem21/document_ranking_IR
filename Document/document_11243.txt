In the same way as other U2 tunes, "One Tree Hill" can be translated in a religious way. "Hot Press" editorial manager Niall Stokes called it "a profound visit de drive", saying "it is a psalm of commendation and festivity which depicted the customary MÃÂori internment of their companion on One Tree Hill and connections it idyllically with topics of recharging and reclamation." Beth Maynard, a Church minister from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the tune "pledges confidence notwithstanding misfortune, consolidating elegiac lines about a companion ... what's more, the martyred Chilean lobbyist and society artist Victor Jara, with an unobtrusive inspiration of end-time recovery and a twisting howl to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain." Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, trusted the verses were an endeavor by Bono to comprehend God's place on the planet. Steve Stockman, a minister at Queen's University Belfast, felt that the tune implied "extraordinary places past the existence of earth". Music columnist Bill Graham noticed "the verses, with their reference to conventional MÃÂori entombment services on One Tree Hill, demonstrated that the band's confidence didn't reject a sympathy with others' convictions and customs. Their Christianity wouldn't mortar over the all inclusive prime examples of grieving."
