The magazine stopped production with the April 1941 issue, yet in 1950 the Goodmans saw a chance to restore it when another blast in sci-fi magazines got going. Erisman was all the while working for the Goodmans, and was recorded as publication executive of the new form of the magazine, yet a significant part of the article work was finished by Daniel Keyes, who was credited as "Publication Associate" on the 1951 issues. The principal issue of the new manifestation of "Wonder Science Stories" was dated November 1950. After two issues Erisman changed the magazine to a review position, however the last issue, dated May 1952, was by and by a mash. The post-war issues contained stories by surely understood authors, including Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov, Richard Matheson, William Tenn, Jack Vance, and Lester del Rey, yet the tales were of just normal quality. As Marchesani would see it, Erisman and Keyes had the capacity to enhance the material distributed in the pre-war "Wonder Tales", yet the field had developed increasingly modern since those days, and the journalists who sold to "Wonder Tales" were presently distributing their best work somewhere else. William Knoles' 1960 "Playboy" article on the mash time, "Young ladies of the Slime God", was, Asimov stated, for the most part dependent on "Wonder".
