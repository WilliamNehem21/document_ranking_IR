In the second year of the war, FÃÂ¼rstenberg was exchanged to the mounted force of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and set responsible for the development watch close Speyer, which was as yet held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by Ketsch at the leader of the development watch, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, without the officer of the city, Adam-Philippe de Custine, who was away with a large portion of his troops; those that stayed behind essentially deserted the city. On the next day, FÃÂ¼rstenberg involved the town of Germersheim. His first battle activity of the war happened on 3 April, when Custine's infantry assaulted him in a blade charge close to the towns of Bellheim, HÃÂ¶rdt and Leimersheim, and subsequently at Landau and Lauterburg. Amid these assaults, he lost all the ground he had picked up in the prior days. After these occasions, he was again exchanged, this opportunity to the order of the Regiment "Tally von Kavanagh", where he kept on separating himself amid the French counter-hostile of OctoberÃ¢ÂÂ November 1793. In the activity around Geidertheim, on the Zorn River, he helped Lieutenant Field Marshal Gabriel Anton, Baron SplÃÂ©ny de MihÃÂ¡ldy, in repulsing a French counter-assault. In no time a while later, he turned out to be sick and, in December 1793, was sent to the Hagenau to recuperate. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the Battle of Froeschwiller against Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru. After the French withdrew over the Rhine at HÃÂ¼ningen, close Basel, he coordinated the development of its new strongholds.
