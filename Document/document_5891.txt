The purpose behind the troubles with the chime isn't sure. The Whitechapel Foundry took the position that the chime was either harmed in travel or was broken by an unpracticed chime ringer, who impulsively sent the clapper flying against the edge, instead of the body of the chime. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum led an examination of the metal in the chime, and presumed that "a progression of blunders made in the development, recreation, and second remaking of the Bell brought about a weak ringer that scarcely missed being separated for scrap". The Museum found a significantly more elevated amount of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel ringers of that time, and proposed that Whitechapel made a mistake in the composite, maybe by utilizing scraps with an abnormal state of tin to start the dissolve rather than the standard unadulterated copper. The examination found that, on the second recasting, rather than adding unadulterated tin to the ringer metal, Pass and Stow included shoddy pewter with a high lead content, and not entirely blended the new metal into the shape. The outcome was "an amazingly weak composite which not just made the Bell bomb in administration however made it simple for early gift gatherers to knock off generous trophies from the edge".
