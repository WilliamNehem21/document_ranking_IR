O'Reilly's underlying posting subsequent to relinquishing his preparation was to an administration school in Erskineville, an internal city suburb in Sydney. At the time, the rural area was ghetto like and devastated, with numerous wild understudies. A large number of the students were scarcely dressed and tried O'Reilly's capacity to teach. He said that he adapted more in three months there under Principal Jeremiah Walsh than he would have in ten years at STC. Real Cook-Russell at that point began a military cadet program in New South Wales schools; O'Reilly begun such a program at Erskineville and his understudies won the statewide challenge "in a lope". O'Reilly's time at Erskineville additionally denoted the beginning of work-sport clashes that hampered his cricket profession. He joined North Sydney Cricket Club in 1926Ã¢ÂÂ 27 and was chosen at short notice to play in an invitational match under resigned Australian skipper Monty Noble at the Sydney Cricket Ground. As the instruction office required seven days' notice for leave demands, O'Reilly declined, yet was then arranged by the Chief Inspector of Schools to play in the wake of turning up at school on the morning of the match. Having taken six wickets, the match was then washed out, and O'Reilly then had his compensation deducted, a lot to his shame.
