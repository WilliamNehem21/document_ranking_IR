Radiometric dating was utilized to decide the time of shake tests from LÃÂÃÂ»ihi. The Hawaii Center for Volcanology tried examples recouped by different campaigns, eminently the 1978 endeavor, which gave 17 dig tests. The greater part of the examples were observed to be of ongoing cause; the most seasoned dated shake is around 300,000 years of age. Following the 1996 occasion, some youthful breccia was likewise gathered. In light of the examples, researchers gauge LÃÂÃÂ»ihi is around 400,000 years of age. The stone gathers at a normal rate of every year close to the base, and close to the summit. On the off chance that the information show from different volcanoes, for example, KÃÂ«lauea remains constant for LÃÂÃÂ»ihi, 40% of the well of lava's mass shaped inside the most recent 100,000 years. Expecting a direct development rate, LÃÂihi is 250,000 years of age. In any case, similarly as with all hotspot volcanoes, LÃÂihi's dimension of movement has expanded with time; consequently, it would take something like 400,000 years for such a well of lava to achieve LÃÂihi's mass. As Hawaiian volcanoes float northwest at a rate of about a year, LÃÂÃÂ»ihi was southeast of its present position at the season of its underlying emission.
