On September 17, 2009, Howard signed a one-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 22, center Joel Przybilla injured his knee in the first quarter, allowing Howard to play additional minutes, which allowed Howard his first double-double since April 6, 2007. He had his other double-double of the 2009â10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season. All of Howard's performances with 10Â rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3. December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24Â starts in 26Â appearances (ending on February 16) for him. Having lost Przybilla and Greg Oden for the season, Portland acquired Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers for Steve Blake and Travis Outlaw on February 17 prior to the trade deadline. During the 2009â10 season, he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73Â games, and made 27Â starts, while averaging 6.0Â points and 4.6Â rebounds. The 2009â10 Trail Blazers were 50â32 under coach Nate McMillan and lost in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs to the Phoenix Suns, four games to two. Howard appeared in all six games, averaging 3.3Â points and 2.7Â rebounds in 14.5Â minutes. He played the most minutes (17:51) in game 4, when he added 8 points and 7 rebounds to help even the series.
