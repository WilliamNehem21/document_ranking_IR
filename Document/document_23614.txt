"Active", the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the "Corona" in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon. The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, "Active" forcing "Corona"'s surrender 45Â minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship. "Active" too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end. The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; "Carolina" and "DanaÃ©" had used the conflict between "Active" and "Corona" to cover their escape while "Flore" had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once "Flore" was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her "Carolina" and "DanaÃ©" and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.
