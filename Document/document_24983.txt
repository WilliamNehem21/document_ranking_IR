Of greater concern, Gunson says, is the "deliberate blurring of responsibility for the coup". The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, "leaving a total power vacuum". However, the high command's senior figure, General Lucas RincÃ³n (who announced ChÃ¡vez's resignation on television), was not part of the coup and remained in the government after April 2002. The petition draws the conclusion, "(1) either General RincÃ³n stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole countryÂ ... or (2) General RincÃ³n lied, because he was an accompliceÂ ... that seems not to be the truth because he [remained in ChÃ¡vez's administration]." Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support. The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for ChÃ¡vez were not the high command, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy, as the film claims. Gunson says, "With one solitary exception, these generals and admirals had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government collapsed." Although Bartley and ÃÂ Briain accept that RincÃ³n said ChÃ¡vez "had agreed to resign", they reiterate that "elements in the military [threatened] force in the effort to make ChÃ¡vez resign"; the filmmakers say it is "irrelevant" that the whole military did not join the coup, as this "is the case with most coups". General RincÃ³n's announcement was omitted because they felt it was "supplementary to the main, key fact of the story", that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists.
