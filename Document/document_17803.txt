At the time of his departure to the United States, Davies planned to return to art by writing a graphic novel, and was approached by Lucasfilm to write for the proposed "Star Wars" live-action television series but refused the commission. Davies' residence in California ended in August 2011 after his boyfriend Andrew Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which prompted Davies to postpone current projects and move back to Manchester with Smith so his partner could undergo treatment closer to their respective families. Davies' move back to the United Kingdom enabled him to develop a replacement series for "The Sarah Jane Adventures" with prolific series writer Phil Ford after the former series ended due to Elisabeth Sladen's death. "Wizards vs Aliens", a CBBC drama about a teenage wizard and his scientist friend and their conflict with the alien Nekross who wish to destroy Earth, was formed to create a "genre clash" between science fiction and supernatural fantasy, as opposed to "culture clashes" such as "Cowboys vs. Aliens". Davies additionally made his first contribution to CBeebies, with two scripts for "Old Jack's Boat", which stars "Doctor Who" alumni Bernard Cribbins and Freema Agyeman as retired fisherman Jack and his neighbour Shelley.
