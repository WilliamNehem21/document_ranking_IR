In 2013, Kapoor teamed up with Ajay Devgn for the fourth time (close by Amitabh Bachchan, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee and Amrita Rao) in Prakash Jha's "Satyagraha", a troupe socio-political dramatization inexactly propelled by social dissident Anna Hazare's battle against debasement in 2011. The film got little recognition from pundits and failed to meet expectations in the cinematic world gaining locally. An audit in the "Day by day News and Analysis" noticed that Kapoor's job as correspondent Yasmin Ahmed might have been "constrained to mouthing a couple of 'essential' discoursed and being available in urgent scenes like any driving woman". Following an appearance in the ineffectively gotten rom-com "Gori Tere Pyaar Mein" (2013), Kapoor diminished her outstanding task at hand for the following two years to concentrate on her marriage and family. She took on littler parts where she played the adoration enthusiasm of Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan in the dramatizations "Singham Returns" (2014) and "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" (2015) individually. "Singham Returns" filled in as a continuation of the 2011 film "Singham" and Kapoor's job was composed explicitly for her by Rohit ShettyÃ¢ÂÂthe third time the pair worked together. Surveys for the film were commonly blended with Kapoor being condemned for playing a job of insignificant significance, yet the film was a money related accomplishment with an income of over . Kabir Khan's "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" developed as India's most astounding winning film of the year netting an aggregate of , and earned the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 63rd National Film Awards.
