Stafford's first open singing appearance was in Long Beach, where the family lived when she was twelve. She sang "Trust Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms", a Stafford family wistful top choice. Her second was unquestionably progressively sensational. As an understudy at Long Beach Polytechnic High School with the lead in the school melodic, she was practicing in front of an audience when the 1933 Long Beach seismic tremor obliterated piece of the school. With her mom's support, Stafford initially wanted to turn into a musical drama artist and considered voice as a tyke, taking private exercises from Foster Rucker, a host on California radio station KNX. In light of the Great Depression, she surrendered that thought and joined her more established sisters Christine and Pauline in a prevalent vocal gathering The Stafford Sisters. The two more established Staffords were at that point some portion of a trio with an inconsequential third part when the demonstration got a major booking at Long Beach's West Coast Theater. Pauline was too sick to even consider performing, and Jo was drafted in to have her spot so they could keep the commitment. She approached her happiness club instructor for seven days' nonattendance from school, saying her mom required her at home, and this was conceded. The execution was a triumph, and Jo turned into a perpetual individual from the gathering.
