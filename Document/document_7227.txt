Johnson was again adulated by Wisden in its report on the 1948 visit. "Obligation for the smooth running of the visit and general amicability of the group was expected to a great extent to the director, Mr Keith Johnson, persevering and constantly pleasant," it said. "Paying tribute to the dependability of the players, Mr Johnson said there had not been a harsh note in the gathering all through the visit." Flanagan marked Johnson as "principled, saved, stately, phenomenally productive and circumspectly reliable". He proceeded to state that "No association, no body corporate, no individual would ever want to have an increasingly steadfast, a progressively committed, or a progressively faithful officer...Although to the world by and large all the applause and greatness for the unequaled triumph the visit ended up being goes to Sir Donald Bradman, just the individuals who went with the group will ever have an appropriate origination of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." Bradman said that Johnson "made companions and generosity wherever both for himself and the group, and no side could have wanted for a superior Manager". On the voyage back to Australia, the players gave Johnson a silver Georgian salver, with their marks engraved on the token.
