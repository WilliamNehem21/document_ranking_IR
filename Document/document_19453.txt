Towards the end of the 17th century Spanish priorities changed, and the failure of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the ChÊ¼ol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region; military options were also viewed more favourably. Between 1685 and 1689, the QÊ¼eqchiÊ¼ of CobÃ¡n and CahabÃ³n were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche ChÊ¼ol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern PetÃ©n and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of PetÃ©n. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor LÃ³pez were active among the Manche and Lakandon ChÊ¼ol. They were eventually expelled by the ChÊ¼ol; upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern PetÃ©n and neighbouring Chiapas. Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to Rabinal in the modern department of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the Manche ChÊ¼ol ceased to play any part in the history of PetÃ©n.
