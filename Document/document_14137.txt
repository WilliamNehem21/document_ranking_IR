A theory of "Albertosaurus" life history proposes that hatchlings kicked the bucket in substantial numbers, yet have not been safeguarded in the fossil record because of their little size and delicate development. After only two years, adolescents were bigger than some other predator in the district beside grown-up "Albertosaurus", and more armada of foot than the greater part of their prey creatures. This brought about a sensational diminishing in their death rate and a comparing uncommonness of fossil remains. Death rates multiplied at age twelve, maybe the aftereffect of the physiological requests of the fast development stage, and afterward multiplied again with the beginning of sexual development between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This raised death rate proceeded all through adulthood, maybe because of the high physiological requests of reproduction, including pressure and wounds got amid intraspecific challenge for mates and assets, and inevitably, the regularly expanding impacts of senescence. The higher death rate in grown-ups may clarify their progressively normal safeguarding. Large creatures were uncommon in light of the fact that couple of people endure sufficiently long to accomplish such sizes. High newborn child death rates, trailed by decreased mortality among adolescents and an abrupt increment in mortality after sexual development, with not very many creatures achieving most extreme size, is an example seen in numerous cutting edge huge warm blooded animals, including elephants, African bison, and rhinoceros. A similar example is additionally observed in different tyrannosaurids. The correlation with present day creatures and different tyrannosaurids loans backing to this life history speculation, however inclination in the fossil record may at present assume a substantial job, particularly since more than 66% of all "Albertosaurus" examples are known from one region.
