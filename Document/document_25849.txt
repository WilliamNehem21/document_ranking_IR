Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of her second album, a pop rock record titled "One of the Boys", and its singles "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot n Cold". The former track also sparked controversy for its sapphic themes. Her third album, "Teenage Dream" (2010), ventured into disco, and was her first album to top the U.S. "Billboard" 200. It topped the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 with the singles "California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)", while "The One That Got Away" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album "Bad". In March 2012, she re-issued the album as "", which produced the songs "Part of Me" and "Wide Awake". Her fourth album, "Prism" (2013), was her second to peak atop the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs "Roar" and "Dark Horse". Her fifth album, "Witness" (2017), delved into electropop and became her third album to reach number one in the U.S. Its most successful single, "Chained to the Rhythm", broke the record for Spotify's most streamed track by a female artist within 24 hours upon its release.
