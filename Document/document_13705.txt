Strindberg was defenseless to solid, autonomous vocation ladies, just as to dainty, fragile looking young ladies; like his first and second spousesÃ¢ÂÂSiri von Essen and Frida UhlÃ¢ÂÂBosse consolidated these characteristics. He was spellbound when he saw the dull, extraordinary looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was regularly thrown in sprite jobs or what were conceptualized as "Oriental" jobs) have her first significant influence, a wicked Puck in "A Midsummer Night's Dream". He quickly selected as a reasonable on-screen character for the piece of The Lady in his coming play "To Damascus", and welcomed her to his lone ranger foundation to talk about the job. At this well known first gathering, Strindberg, as indicated by Bosse's story of the occasion, met her at the entryway all grins and appeal. Offering her wine, blooms, and perfectly masterminded organic product, he imparted to her his interest with speculative chemistry, demonstrating her a brilliant dark colored blend he advised her was gold he had made. When she got up to leave, Bosse claims Strindberg requested the plume in her cap to use for composing his plays. Bosse offered it to him, and he utilized this plume, with a steel nib embed, to compose every one of his shows amid their marriage. It is presently in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm.
