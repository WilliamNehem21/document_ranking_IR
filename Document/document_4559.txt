The composition of the pilot was reprimanded as "heavy", and having "well-known, traditional plots". One commentator guaranteed it didn't offer much "to motivate an on-screen character", while another idea it had the "most exceedingly bad composition of the new season". The discourse was portrayed as "moan initiating". Tom Shales of "The Washington Post" condemned the arrangement makers' choice to make St. John a private examiner, and felt that they "seem anxious to evade what makes their show exceptional". Mary McNamara of the "Los Angeles Times" saw guarantee in the arrangement, yet commented it got "lost among idea and execution, and rather than tension we get nonsensicalness, as though the makers were resolved to utilize just the buzzwords of the two classifications". The acting of the pilot was scrutinized as "crummy" and "woeful". Robert Bianco of "USA Today" felt that "Twilight" had a "less proficient cast" than "Holy messenger". Matthew Gilbert of the "Boston Globe" deteriorated the science among O'Loughlin and Myles as "fake", and said that they "trade lines of discourse with a stilted cadence and no characteristic stream". O'Loughlin was portrayed as a "flatliner", and "acceptable ahead of the pack job", while Sossamon's appearance was said to be "unbelievably not-startling". Travis Fickett of IGN lauded the performers, in any case, and felt that O'Loughlin did "a conventional activity", and that Myles was "maybe the most encouraging part of the show". Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" praised Myles as "sensibly great".
