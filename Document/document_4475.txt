Religion would have a key impact in Henry's life; his dad and namesake uncle were both faithful and were both real impacts throughout his life. In any case, he was awkward with the job of the Anglican Church as the set up religion in Virginia, and battled for religious freedom all through his vocation. Henry kept in touch with a gathering of Baptists who had sent a letter of congrats following Henry's 1776 decision as senator, "My sincere wish is, that Christian philanthropy, self control and love may join every single distinctive influence as brethren." He censured his province of Virginia, feeling that subjection and absence of religious toleration had hindered its advancement. He told the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, "That religion or the obligation which we owe to our Creator, and the way of releasing it, can be coordinated just by reason and conviction, not by power or brutality, and along these lines all men have an equivalent, normal and unalienable ideal to the free exercise of religion as indicated by the directs of still, small voice, and that no specific religious group or society should be supported or set up by law in inclination to other people."
