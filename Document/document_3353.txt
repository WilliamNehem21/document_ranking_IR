From the start, Buechler endeavored to integrate the past movies by having Jason's appearance mirror that of the harm he got in the past portions. Buechler needed the speedboat harm from "Jason Lives", and the hatchet and cleaver cuts Jason got "To some degree 3" and "Section 4" to part of the plan for "The New Blood". Since Jason had been submerged in the past passage, the impacts group needed Jason to seem "spoiled", with bones and ribs appearing, for Jason's highlights to have a progressively characterized feel to them. Howard Berger was enlivened via Carl Fullerton's plan in "The New Blood", and needed to join the uncovered substance idea into his model for "Jason Goes to Hell". Berger structured Jason's skin to cover with the veil, to influence it to show up as though the skin and cover had combined and the veil could never again be evacuated. Gregory Nicotero and Berger shaped a full-body, froth latex suit for Kane Hodder to wear under the outfit. The thought was to uncover however much of Jason's skin as could reasonably be expected, in light of the fact that Nicotero and Berger realized the physical character would not be seen for the vast majority of the film.
