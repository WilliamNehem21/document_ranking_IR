"Ethalion" took over pursuit of "Bellone" from "Melampus", and for two hours maintained continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. "Ethalion" was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with "Bellone" during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered "Bellone" eventually surrendered. "Hoche" apart, "Bellone" had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling "Anson" discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach as he had been too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on "Loire". The damaged "Anson" was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.
