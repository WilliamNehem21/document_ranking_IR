"The Prayer Tour" started in Europe not long after the arrival of the collection. The band played out various prominent shows, incorporating appears before more than 40,000ÃÂ fans more than two evenings in Paris and their first exhibitions in Eastern Europe. Following the European leg, the band chose to venture out to North America for their up and coming US leg by vessel, rather than plane. Smith and Gallup shared a dread of flight, and eventually deplored the up and coming dates, wishing to decrease the quantity of shows they booked. The record name and visit advertisers firmly deviated, and even proposed to add a few new shows to the schedule due to the accomplishment of "Crumbling" in the US. The principal show in the United States was at New Jersey's Giants Stadium, where 44,000ÃÂ people visited; 30,000ÃÂ tickets were obtained on the primary day alone. The opening demonstrations at Giant Stadium were: Pixies, Shelleyan Orphan and Love and Rockets alongside a unique appearance by The Bubblemen. The band were very disappointed with the gigantic turnout; as per Roger O'Donnell: "We had been adrift for five days. The arena was too enormous for us to take it all in. We've concluded that we don't care for playing arenas that vast." Smith reviews that "it was never our expectation to progress toward becoming as large as this".
