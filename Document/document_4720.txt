Triadic pyramids previously showed up in the Preclassic. They comprised of an overwhelming structure flanked by two littler internal confronting structures, all mounted upon a solitary basal stage. The biggest known triadic pyramid was worked at El Mirador in the PetÃÂ©n Basin; it covers a region multiple times as substantial as that secured by Temple IV, the biggest pyramid at Tikal. The three superstructures all have stairways driving up from the focal square over the basal stage. No safely settled harbingers of Triadic Groups are known, yet they may have created from the eastern range working of E-Group buildings. The triadic structure was the overwhelming engineering structure in the PetÃÂ©n locale amid the Late Preclassic. Instances of triadic pyramids are referred to from upwards of 88 archeological locales. At Nakbe, there are something like twelve instances of triadic edifices and the four biggest structures in the city are triadic in nature. At El Mirador there are most likely upwards of 36 triadic structures. Instances of the triadic structure are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the furthest north of the YucatÃÂ¡n Peninsula, and QÃÂ¼umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala. The triadic pyramid remained a prevalent design structure for a considerable length of time after the main precedents were constructed; it proceeded being used into the Classic Period, with later models being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque. The QÃÂ¼umarkaj model is the special case that has been dated to the Postclassic Period. The triple-sanctuary type of the triadic pyramid gives off an impression of being identified with Maya folklore.
