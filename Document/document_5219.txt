With Canada at war out of the blue since its adaptation of the Victoria Cross was made, arrangements for a physical cast of the decoration were started in 2006, when a board of trustees called the Victoria Cross Production Planning Group was shaped under the administration of the Chancellery of Honors at Rideau Hall. It initially comprised of delegates from the Department of National Defense, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, and the gathering later extended to incorporate people from the Department of Canadian Heritage, Natural Resources Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mint, with help given by the Queen and the British Ministry of Defense. Following their examination and consultations, the principal Victoria Cross enhancement was struck in 2007, as affirmed by Deputy Herald Chancellor Emmanuelle Sajous, and the decoration was formally discharged to people in general on 16 May 2008 by Governor General MichaÃÂ«lle Jean at Rideau Hall. It was one of 20 thrown, every one of which is made out of three groupings of metals: that of a Russian gun caught at the attack of Sevastopol (1854Ã¢ÂÂ 1855), given by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, made to stamp Canada's confederation in 1867; and a determination of metals from every one of Canada's locales. These were cast, instead of struck, proceeding with the convention began in the United Kingdom when it was discovered the metal amalgam was unreasonably weak for striking, and completed at the Royal Canadian Mint. The initial two were sent to Buckingham Palace for expansion to the British Royal Collection and different examples were kept as a major aspect of the Crown Collection at Rideau Hall, just as at the Department of National Defense, Library and Archives Canada, and the Canadian War Museum.
