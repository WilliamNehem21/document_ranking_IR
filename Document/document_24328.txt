The first part of the obelisk would be 40Â ftÂ² (12Â mÂ²) square and high. It then would reduce to 32Â ftÂ² (9Â mÂ²) square and rise . The next segment would be 22Â ftÂ² (6Â mÂ²) and would rise to become 6Â ftÂ² (1.8Â mÂ²) at the top. The total height would be . In the pedestal there would be 300Â ftÂ² (91Â mÂ²) of floor space. Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a Victrola." It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000Â ftÂ³ (850Â mÂ³) of sand, 58,000Â ftÂ³ (1,642Â mÂ³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a long retaining wall of stone and concrete.
