Cole held direction of RAAF Station Laverton from 1929 until his arrangement as Air Member for Supply (AMS) in January 1933. The AMS involved a seat reporting in real time Board, which was led by the Chief of the Air Staff and was on the whole in charge of control and organization of the RAAF. In March 1932, Cole acknowledged a welcome from the Lord Mayor of Melbourne to fill in as Deputy Chairman of the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia, to observe Melbourne's Centenary. Arrangement of the RAAF's radio offices and professionals was viewed as a help for hopefuls, however Cole later recorded that his job included "twenty months' diligent work, without payÃÂ ... with heaps of vulgar and other analysis". Elevated to bunch skipper in January 1935, he turned into the debut leader (CO) of Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 20ÃÂ April 1936. The new home office, which had been framed from components of two of the base's tenant units, No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron and No.ÃÂ 2 Aircraft Depot, superseded a prior game plan where the CO of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron had served as the station officer. Cole was delegated a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honors of 11ÃÂ May 1937, and went to the Imperial Defense College in London the next year. He came back to RAAF Station Laverton as CO in February 1939, taking over from Group Captain Henry Wrigley.
