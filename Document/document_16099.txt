Of the 314 personnel aboard "Voyager" at the time of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while "Voyager" was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship's location, "Melbourne"s bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert "Voyager" and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base âa move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotionâbut resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by "Voyager"s former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of "Melbourne" were absolved of blame for the incident.
