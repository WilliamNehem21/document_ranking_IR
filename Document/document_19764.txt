The same day as the "coup d'Ã©tat", Hitler issued Directive 25, which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the Balkans. He ordered that "even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible". German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ fighters were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate. Hitler decided that Belgrade would be bombed as punishment for the coup against the government that had signed the Pact, under the codename Operation Retribution ("Unternehmen Strafgericht"). On 27 and 28 March 1941, "Reichsmarschall" Hermann GÃ¶ring transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of "Luftflotte" IV, "Generaloberst" (General) Alexander LÃ¶hr, allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. LÃ¶hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April. Although Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, at the last minute LÃ¶hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.
