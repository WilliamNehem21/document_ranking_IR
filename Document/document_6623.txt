One of the most punctual schools in the ward was the Close Wesleyan Day School, a Dame school opened around 1840. St Thomas' day school was opened on 4 March 1861, and housed over 500ÃÂ children. Due to congestion and the danger of subsidence brought about by neighborhood mining action, the school was modified on another site along School Street, given by the Earl of Wilton. It was opened in October 1877 by Lady Wilton. On the contrary side of the town St John's school began life in 1860 as a foundation along Irwell Street, and by 1864 contained 120ÃÂ children. The structures were developed in 1869. In 1897 eight educators and a screen instructed 358ÃÂ children. In 1899 the school leaving age was twelve, and a considerable lot of the senior class were "half-clocks" who might go through a large portion of the day at school, and the other half at work. This framework was canceled in 1919. Normal pandemics of red fever, chicken pox, mumps, and particularly measles, implied that in 1897 and 1903 the school was incidentally shut. St John's School and the adjacent church were decimated during the 1970s. Radcliffe likewise had a specialized school on Whittaker Street. Formally opened by Lord Stanley on 7 November 1896, it abutted the open showers on Whittaker Street. The structure is currently utilized as gathering workplaces.
