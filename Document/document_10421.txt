On 12ÃÂ November 1945, at the main general gathering of Army administration, Sudirman was chosen Commander of the Armed Forces ("Panglima Besar") following two gridlocked cast a ballot. In the third round, Oerip had 21ÃÂ votes to Sudirman'sÃÂ 22; the division administrators from Sumatra casted a ballot consistently for Sudirman and influenced the ticket to support him. Sudirman, agedÃÂ 29 at the time, was astonished at his determination and offered to give up the administration position to Oerip, yet the gathering did not permit it. Oerip himself, who had lost control of the gathering before the vote, was happy to never again be accountable for the whole Army. Sudirman kept Oerip to fill in as head of staff under him. As per his new job, Sudirman was elevated to general. After the gathering, Sudirman came back to Banyumas to anticipate affirmation as pioneer of the TKR and started creating techniques on how repulse Allied advances. The Indonesians expected that the Dutch, through the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (, or NICA), would endeavor to retake the archipelago; officers of the Dutch-British coalition had arrived in Java in September, and a vast fight had happened in Surabaya amid late October and early November. This shakiness, just as Sukarno's vulnerability about Sudirman's capabilities, prompted a deferral in Sudirman's affirmation.
