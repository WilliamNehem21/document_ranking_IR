Sir Timothy Shelley gave his grandson Percy Florence an expansion in his remittance for his twenty-first birthday celebration, permitting Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to design a second, longer excursion to the Continent. In June 1842, Mary Shelley and her child left for a fourteen-month visit. They were joined by a couple of his companions: Alexander Andrew Knox, a writer and classicist, whom Emily Sunstein, a biographer of Mary Shelley, portrays as "reminiscent of [Percy] Shelley"; Henry Hugh Pearson, a performer who had composed melodic backups for a few of Percy Shelley's ballads; and Robert Leslie Ellis. Mary Shelley trusted that the simple habits of the other young fellows would rub off on her clumsy child, however rather they ended up trivial and desirous of one another. The gathering visited LiÃÂ¨ge, Cologne, Coblenz, Mainz, Frankfurt, Kissingen, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Salzburg, the Tyrol, Innsbruck, Riva, Verona, Venice, Florence, and Rome. In Rome, Mary Shelley visited galleries with the French workmanship pundit Alex Rio; Percy Florence was disinterested with the way of life and would not see the craftsmanship, irritating his mom, who spent an expanding measure of her time seeing the nation with Knox. She likewise paid various visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley's grave in Rome. Following two months in the Sorrento Peninsula, the gathering was shy of cash; Percy Florence and his companions returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris.
