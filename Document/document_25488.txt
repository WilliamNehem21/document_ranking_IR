Although proposals to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base were initially rejected, the United States Department of Defense eventually expended over $100Â million to begin repairs. Unsalvageable buildings were demolished. Reconstruction then began on a Florida Air National Guard tower, air traffic control tower, and maintenance hangars. Next, the rebuilding of communications, medical, security facility, vehicle maintenance, and wing headquarters buildings began. On March 5, 1994, the base reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base. Prior to Andrew, the base employed approximately 6,500Â military personnel and 1,000Â civilians and annually added about $450Â million to the local economy. After its reopening, Major Bobby D'Angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that â between $180Â million and $200Â million. The city of Homestead spent about $6Â million on rebuilding the Homestead Sports Complex. Despite this, the Cleveland Indians, fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans, moved their spring training location to Chain of Lakes Park in Winter Haven. As homes were being rebuilt, FEMA provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501Â families and financial assistance to more than 40,000Â other families for staying in hotel rooms, paying rent, and repairing homes. Nearly two years after Andrew, about 70% of homes in Homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt. Additionally, of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout Dade County, 36,000Â had been restored by July 1994.
