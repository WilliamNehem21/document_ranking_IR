Discussion has happened with respect to whether the ocean mink was its very own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. The individuals who contend that the ocean mink was a subspecies regularly allude to it as "Neovison vison macrodon". An examination in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American scientist, inferred that the contrasts between the American mink and the ocean mink were too moment to even think about justifying the last's order as a different animal varieties, and he named it "Lutreola vison antiquus". An investigation directed in 2000 by Mead et al. disproved Loomis by asserting that the size range for the biggest ocean mink example was past that of the American mink, in this way making it a different animal categories. Be that as it may, a recent report by Graham reasoned that this size contrast was inadequate proof to arrange the ocean mink as its very own species and that it ought to be viewed as a subspecies. Graham guessed that the size distinction was brought about by natural elements. Moreover, Graham detailed that Mead expected the littler mink examples to be the American mink, and the bigger mink examples outside the scope of the American mink to be ocean minks; this may have been an instance of sexual dimorphism wherein all examples were ocean minks, the bigger being male and the littler being female. A recent report thought about the dental cosmetics of the ocean mink to the American mink, and reasoned that they were particular enough to be viewed as independent species.
