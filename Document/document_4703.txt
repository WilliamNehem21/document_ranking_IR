An investigation of waterfront heaths on Pleistocene sand rises around the Myall Lakes discovered "B.aemula" developed on edges (dry heath) and "B. oblongifolia" on slants (wet heath), and the two species did not cover. Control of seedlings in a similar report region demonstrated that "B. aemula" develops longer roots looking for water and that seedlings do develop in wet heath, yet it is up 'til now vague why the species does not develop in wet heath just as dry heath. Not at all like comparative circumstances with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species did not seem to affect contrarily on one another. A field think about on seedling enlistment directed at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast demonstrated that for the most part "Banksia aemula" created seedlings in low numbers yet the whittling down rate was low, and that seedlings had a more noteworthy survival rate on dry instead of wet heaths. Field work including the test planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park demonstrated that "Banksia aemula" seedling roots achieve the water table inside a half year of germination, and that they can sprout in the nearness or nonattendance of ongoing bushfire. The purposes behind bradyspory (that is less seeds with more noteworthy level of survival) is hazy, yet might be a safeguard against seed-eating creatures. Also in field chip away at North Stradbroke Island, "B.aemula" was noted to shed its winged seeds over the long haul between (just as after) flame, and develop and develop promptly with little predation by herbivores.
