Old legend expresses that Vana'diel was made as a play area for the Gods and their kids, themselves' identity generated from a colossal and conscious Crystal. In the end wishing to be unified with the Gods, the kids built a pathway to heaven. They were destroyed down for their impoliteness, in any case, and their urban communities cast to the base of the ocean. In the wake of seeing the pulverization of her kids and loaded up with pity, the Goddess Altana sobbed five tears that offered life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, denounced her shortcoming, in any case, and the existence that emerged from it. Promathia reviled the five races with unceasing clash among themselves by delivering their darkest qualities: the aloofness of the Humes, the presumption of the Elvaan, the fierceness of the Galka, the weakness of the Tarutaru, and the jealousy of the Mithra. He made the Beastmen, instructing them to everlastingly battle the general population of Vana'diel and consume their brains, so these youngsters could never have sufficient energy to bunch together and build a pathway like the ones preceding them. The creation legend's conscious Crystal, Gods, Children, and the realities behind them highlight as significant plot focuses in a few "Last Fantasy XI" extension packs, while the Beastmen are a portion of the amusement's primary rivals.
