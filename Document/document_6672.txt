Democratization still left open one critical refinement between the previous royal states and the previous British regions, specifically, that since the regal states had marked constrained Instruments of Accession covering just three subjects, they were protected from government approaches in different regions. The Congress saw this as hampering its capacity to outline arrangements that realized social equity and national improvement. Subsequently, they tried to verify to the focal government a similar level of controls over the previous royal states as it had over the previous British regions. In May 1948, at the activity of V. P. Menon, a gathering was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the royal associations and the States Department, toward the finish of which the Rajpramukhs marked new Instruments of Accession which enabled the Government of India to pass laws in regard of all issues that fell inside the seventh calendar of the Government of India Act 1935. Along these lines, every one of the august associations, just as Mysore and Hyderabad, consented to embrace the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, in this way guaranteeing they were set in the very same lawful position versus the focal government as the previous British regions. The main special case was Kashmir, whose association with India kept on being represented by the first Instrument of Accession, and the constitution delivered by the state's Constituent Assembly.
