Beam hauls the case to the highest point of the stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the couch, puts a pad over her face and shoots her. Gerald kills the music as the doorbell is heard. Noting the entryway, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign perusing "Hi, my name is Paul. I am hard of hearing and stupid." The switch of the sign peruses "Do you need any cleaning items today?" Gerald heads inside and shrouds Sabrina's body as Paul pauses. Gerald sprinkles his soup onto the blood and welcomes Paul to clean it. Beam keeps running down the stairs and meets Paul; he continues to purchase rope before returning upstairs. Paul keeps on cleaning, however observes the bullethole in the pad, and afterward the bag being brought down outside the window. Gerald makes a beeline for examine, however Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The thieves keep running past Paul and watch out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings somebody and says "Hi, it's me. Better believe it, it's finished." He looks to the phony painting, and says "I have it directly here. No doubt, it's fine. Not a peep out of anybody." He brings down the sketch and exits, as the genuine canvas is seen soaking in the pool.
