In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits Henry Garnet and John Gerard on a journey to the sanctum of St Winefride's Well in Holywell. Late in September, he was drawn nearer by Robert Catesby, Thomas Wintour and John Wright, and welcome to join what ended up known as the Gunpowder Plot. English Catholics had trusted that the abuse of their confidence would end when James I went to the royal position, as his frame of mind seemed, by all accounts, to be moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby's view, James had reneged on his guarantees. He accordingly intended to execute the ruler by exploding the House of Lords with black powder, and after that inducing a prominent revolt to introduce James' little girl, Elizabeth, as main ruler. To this end he had just helped enroll nine Catholics into the connivance, however was coming up short on cash and expected to select more men. Rookwood was a pony raiser, and his stable of fine mounts at Coldham Hall was required for the Midlands uprising. He had been approached to supply them with explosive about a year sooner, under the misrepresentation that it was for William Stanley's regiment in FlandersÃ¢ÂÂno longer an unlawful task because of the ongoing Treaty of LondonÃ¢ÂÂhowever generally gave no assets to the trick.
