Kanaka Dasa (whose birth name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509â1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker, who according to historical accounts came from a family of Kuruba (shepherds) or "beda" (hunters). Under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king, he authored such important writings as "Mohanatarangini" ("River of Delight", 1550), written in dedication to King Krishnadevaraya, which narrates the story of Krishna in "sangatya" metre. His other famous writings are "Narasimhastava", a work dealing with glory of God Narasimha, "Nalacharita", the story of Nala, which is noted for its narration, and "Hari Bhaktisara", a spontaneous writing on devotion in "shatpadi" metre. The latter writing, which is on "niti" (morals), "bhakti" (devotion) and "vairagya" (renunciation), continues to be a popular standard book of learning for children. A unique allegorical poem titled "Ramadhanya Charitre" ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which exalts ragi over rice was authored by Kanaka Dasa. In this poem, a quarrel arises between ragi, the food grain of the poor, and rice, that of the rich, as to which is superior. Rama decides that ragi is superior because it does not rot when preserved. This is one of the earliest poetic expressions of class struggle in the Kannada language. In addition to these classics, about 240 songs written by Kanaka Dasa are available.
