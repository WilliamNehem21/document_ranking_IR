Extra improvement has been progressing on the grounds of Kent State University and the to a great extent private neighborhood situated between downtown Kent and the western edge of grounds. The college started purchasing properties in that area in 2007 and by December 2012 had gained 43. Development of the University Esplanade expansion, intended to interface grounds with downtown, began in August 2012 after a few of the structures in the territory, a large portion of which had been rental homes, were obliterated or moved. The Esplanade augmentation proceeded with a section of the Portage Hike and Bike Trail that reaches out to Dix Stadium and was finished in October 2013. Kent State built a $48 million, office for the College of Architecture and Environmental Design along the Esplanade augmentation and furthermore moved the previous home of May Prentice, the main female employee at Kent State, to the expansion as the home for the Wick Poetry Center. Development on the design building began in October 2014 and was finished in August 2016. Altogether, there are plans totaling roughly $150 million for a few different offices and updates crosswise over grounds, including another structure for the College of Applied Engineering, Sustainability and Technology and a redesign and revamping of the offices for the School of Art. The city and province have additionally observed advancements in a similar region.
