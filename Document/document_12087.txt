Unbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was likewise adrift, having cruised from Spithead on 12 June with 14 boats of the line and 11 littler vessels under the direction of Admiral Alexander Hood, first Viscount Bridport. Bridport had been entrusted with guaranteeing the security of an escort of transports, told by Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, which conveyed a French Royalist armed force to Quiberon with the expectation of setting off a counter-upset in Brittany. This power comprised of an extra three boats of the line, six frigates and in excess of 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage over the English Channel and around the Ushant headland took seven days, the joined armada and expeditionary power touching base off Belle ÃÂle on 19 June. Bridport had requested Warren to take his escort on to Quiberon while the fundamental body of the Channel Fleet stood farther to ocean to capture any assault by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport expected would propel southwards from Brest. What the British chief of naval operations did not know was that not just had the French armada cruised seven days sooner, yet that they were as yet adrift Ã¢ÂÂ Villaret's boats having been passed up a serious storm on 18 June and compelled to take cover in the jetty off Belle ÃÂle.
