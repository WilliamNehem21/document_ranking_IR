"Jump on Top", a tune which contains noteworthy utilization of a wah pedal, was framed after a jam session directed soon after Frusciante had tuned in to Public Enemy: "I thought of [the mood to the song] while in transit to practiceÃ¢ÂÂsimply tapping it out with my foot." The downplayed guitar solo played amidst the tune was initially proposed to be progressively perceptible, as per Frusciante, who was playing shouting guitar performances. He changed his point of view in the wake of tuning in to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' "Siberian Khatru": "the band sounded hugeÃ¢ÂÂand they're playing actually quickÃ¢ÂÂand afterward this wipe guitar solo turns out over on top. It's extremely delightful, similar to it's without anyone else kind of rack. For 'Jump On Top' I needed to play something that differentiated between the performance and the foundation." "Guardian angel", a tune found towards the finish of the collection, includes overwhelming impacts, most quite an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second deferral. Frusciante noticed that the sound is "straightforwardly motivated by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. On the off chance that you tune in to the real notes, they're similar to a Clapton soloÃ¢ÂÂthey simply don't seem like it as a result of the impacts."
