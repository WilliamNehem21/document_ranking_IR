By this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work. In July 1930, he was posted aboard the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) flagship, the heavy cruiser HMAS "Australia", as squadron signals officer. He continued in this role upon transferring to "Australia"s sister ship, HMAS "Canberra", in May 1931. In early 1932, he was assigned to the Navy Office in Melbourne, returning to "Canberra" as squadron signals officer in August 1933. He was promoted to commander in June 1934 and the following month became executive officer of the RANC. Departing the college in July 1936, he returned to England and spent six months working in the British Naval Intelligence Division. A stint as executive officer of the repair ship HMS "Resource" followed. In November 1937, Waller was given his first command at sea, the RN destroyer HMS "Brazen". His ship handling was criticised early on, but was soon reported by his superiors as having "improved greatly". Stationed in the Mediterranean, "Brazen" monitored progress of the Spanish Civil War, a duty that included protecting British merchant vessels and rescuing the crews of sinking ships. By June 1939, Waller had returned to Australia to become Director of Signals and Communications at the Navy Office.
