Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, and they endeavored to induce him to join the Los Alamos Laboratory, however Oliphant felt that he would be of more use helping Lawrence on the electromagnetic undertaking. As needs be, the Technical Subcommittee coordinated that Oliphant and six associates would go to Berkeley, and later proceed onward to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had very unique structures, and that the American one was solidified, yet Lawrence, who had communicated a craving for Oliphant to go along with him on the electromagnetic undertaking as right on time as 1942, was energetic for Oliphant's help. Oliphant verified the administrations of a kindred Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on attractive mines, alongside James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the pit magnetron. This underlying gathering set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator aircraft in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had deficiencies of key abilities, especially physicists, scientists and specialists. He won on Sir David Rivett, the leader of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to discharge Eric Burhop to chip away at the task. His solicitations for work force were met, and the British mission at Berkeley developed in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.
