Albeit religious writers after the Norman Conquest blamed him for wrongdoings, for example, prevarication and murder, they don't give any proof of those violations. Very nearly 100 years after his passing, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was insulted in 1164 by King Henry II's nobles with Stigand's destiny for setting out to contradict his lord. Present day history specialists sees will in general consider him to be either a wily government official and aloof religious administrator or to see him absolutely as far as his ministerial failings. The student of history Frank Stenton felt that his "entire profession demonstrates that he was basically a lawmaker". Agreeing with this, the history specialist Nick Higham said that "Stigand was a prepared government official whose vocation had been based on an exact perusing of the parity of intensity." Another student of history, Eric John, said that "Stigand had a reasonable case to be the most exceedingly awful diocesan of Christendom". In any case, the antiquarian Frank Barlow felt that "he was a man of refined tastes, a supporter of human expressions who was liberal to the religious communities which he held". Alexander Rumble contended that Stigand was unfortunate in living past the Conquest, expressing that one might say that Stigand was "unfortunate to live so long that he found in his lifetime not just the finish of the Anglo-Saxon state yet in addition the difficult of uncanonical, yet until now endured, rehearses by a flood of ecclesiastical changes".
