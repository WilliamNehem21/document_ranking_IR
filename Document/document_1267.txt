By 1930, MacArthur was 50 and still the most youthful and best known about the U.S. Armed force's real commanders. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a concise time was in direction of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was confirmed as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the position of general. While in Washington, he would ride home every day to eat with his mom. At his work area, he would wear a Japanese stately kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and smoke cigarettes in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the nights, he got a kick out of the chance to peruse military history books. About this time, he started alluding to himself as "MacArthur". He had officially contracted an advertising staff to advance his picture with the American open, together with a lot of thoughts he was known to support, to be specific: a conviction that America required a strongman chief to manage the likelihood that Communists may lead the majority of the incredible masses of jobless into an unrest; that America's fate was in the Asia-Pacific locale; and a solid threatening vibe toward the British Empire. One contemporary depicted MacArthur as the best on-screen character to ever fill in as a U.S Army general while another composed that MacArthur had a court as opposed to a staff.
