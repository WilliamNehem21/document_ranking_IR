The primary system Cage utilized for arrangement is that of settled extents: a discretionary succession of numbers characterizes the structure of a piece on both the naturally visible and the tiny dimension, with the goal that the bigger pieces of each piece are in a similar connection to the entire as the littler parts are to a solitary unit of it. For example, the extent for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3ÃÂ¼, 3ÃÂ¼ (in entire notes), and a unit here is equivalent to 8ÃÂ½ bars (the finish of a unit is set apart with a twofold barline in the score, except if it concurs with the finish of a segment). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Segment A comprises of a solitary unit, created by the given extent: connection on the minute dimension. An is rehashed, and AA shapes the initial segment of the extent on the plainly visible dimension: 1, 1. B comprises of three units and a reference section of ÃÂ¼ of a unit. B is likewise rehashed, and BB gives the second 50% of the extent: 3ÃÂ¼, 3ÃÂ¼. In this way, AABB has extents 1, 1, 3ÃÂ¼, 3ÃÂ¼: relationship on the naturally visible dimension. The melodic expressions inside every unit are additionally represented by a similar extent. See "Model 2" for a diagram of the structure of Sonata III.
