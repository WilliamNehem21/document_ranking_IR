The fight was strategically uncertain, with the Union enduring a higher generally speaking number of setbacks, albeit Lee in fact was crushed on the grounds that he pulled back first from the combat zone and withdrew back to Virginia, and lost a bigger level of his military than McClellen did. McClellan wired to Washington, "Our triumph was finished. The foe is driven again into Virginia." Yet there was evident dissatisfaction that McClellan had not smashed Lee, who was battling with a littler armed force with its back to the Potomac River. Despite the fact that McClellan's subordinates can guarantee a lot of obligation regarding delays, (for example, Ambrose Burnside's misfortunes at Burnside Bridge) and botches (Edwin V. Sumner's assault without observation), these were restricted issues from which the full armed force could have recuperated. Similarly as with the definitive fights in the Seven Days, McClellan's home office were excessively far to the back to permit his own command over the fight. He utilized his rangers powers for observation. He didn't share his general fight plans with his corps administrators, which kept them from utilizing activity outside of their parts. What's more, he was extremely eager to acknowledge careful counsel about sparing his stores, for example, when a noteworthy leap forward in the focal point of the Confederate line could have been misused, yet Fitz John Porter is said to have told McClellan, "Recollect, General, I direction the last save of the last Army of the Republic."
