Toward the beginning of April Tanzanian powers started to focus their endeavors on debilitating the Ugandan position in Kampala. Tanzanian officers had initially accepted that Amin would station the majority of his powers in the capital, and their underlying plans required an immediate assault on the city. In any case, from the high ground in Mpigi they could see the Entebbe promontory, where there was substantial Libyan air traffic and an extensive unforeseen of Ugandan and Libyan officers. In the event that the TPDF caught Kampala before verifying the town of Entebbe, it is helpless to a flanking assault. Taking Entebbe would remove Uganda's Libyan fortifications and license an ambush on the capital from the south. Msuguri settled on the choice to assault the promontory first, and requested the 208th Brigade to verify it. A fundamental assault terrified Amin in his official living arrangement, the Entebbe State House, and he fled by means of helicopter to Kampala. On 7 April the detachment progressed into the town. Numerous Libyan fighters endeavored to empty to Kampala yet were captured and murdered. Following the seizure of Entebbe, several Ugandan warriors garrisoning Kampala fled. The remainders of the Libyan power joined the staying Ugandan troops and took up positions around the capital. Their resolve was very low.
