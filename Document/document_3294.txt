Cambridge won the coin hurl and the Light Blue pontoon club president, Tim Wooge, was clear: "Cambridge pick Surrey". Cambridge chose to begin from the southern bank (the "Surrey side") of the Thames, giving the northern side of the stream (the "Middlesex side") to Oxford. At race time, conditions were cloudy and windy. Oxford took an early lead with a somewhat higher stroke rate than Cambridge as both coxes were cautioned by the umpire to evade a conflict. By the Mile Post, the Dark Blues were a large portion of a-second ahead. Five minutes into the race, Oxford, with 33% of a length lead, were cautioned again by the umpire and moved far from the dashing line, and following a progression of paddle conflicts, enabled Cambridge to lead the pack, shooting Hammersmith Bridge a second ahead. Oxford kept on keeping in contact with Cambridge along the long center twist of the course, towards the Chiswick Steps, and retook the lead on the way to deal with Barnes Bridge as the course bended back to support them. With a three-quarter length lead at Barnes, Oxford started to debilitate and Cambridge recuperated to 33% of a length. With each stroke, the Cambridge vessel picked up on Oxford, outrating them in a "run complete", yet the Dark Blues passed the completing post ahead, the tightest winning edge ever of race.
