The biggest known "Tarbosaurus" skull is more than long, bigger than all different tyrannosaurids with the exception of "Tyrannosaurus". The skull was tall, similar to that of "Tyrannosaurus", yet not as wide, particularly towards the back. The unexpanded back of the skull implied that "Tarbosaurus" eyes did not confront straightforwardly advances, recommending that it came up short on the binocular vision of "Tyrannosaurus". Vast fenestrae (openings) in the skull decreased its weight. Somewhere in the range of 58 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, somewhat more than in "Tyrannosaurus" yet less than in littler tyrannosaurids like "Gorgosaurus" and "Alioramus". The vast majority of its teeth were oval in cross area, despite the fact that the teeth of the premaxilla at the tip of the upper jaw had a "D"- molded cross segment. This heterodonty is normal for the family. The longest teeth were in the maxilla (upper jaw bone), with crowns up to 85ÃÂ millimeters (3.3ÃÂ in) long. In the lower jaw, an edge on the external surface of the precise bone verbalized with the back of the dentary bone, making a locking instrument remarkable to "Tarbosaurus" and "Alioramus". Different tyrannosaurids came up short on this edge and had greater adaptability in the lower jaw.
