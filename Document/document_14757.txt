The general public's next gathering was hung on February 13, 1819, in the old Hampshire County Courthouse, where the principal matter for discussion was "Settled: That an agent ought to be administered by directions from his constituents." Following the discussion, the choice was rendered for the positive. The second gathering, which was hung on February 19 of that year at the Romney Academy, discussed the inquiry, "Is a training gained at the state funded school or [is] a private coach to be favored?" and the general public supported the government funded school. As of now meeting, the principal cash appropriated by the general public was paid to the doorkeeper for a whole of 25 pennies. Likewise as of now meeting, the treasurer was told to buy a book for use by the secretary, three candles, one sets of snuffers, and three pounds of candles. On February 26, the general public contended the inquiry, "Is an arrangement of banking favorable to a network?" The discussion finished under the choice that an arrangement of banking was invaluable. The accompanying gathering on March 6 discussed an inquiry unquestionably increasingly mental in nature, which was a dynamic inquiry of religion: "Can the human personality, by its own appearance, touch base at the end that the spirit is undying?" The general public chose in the pessimistic. The general public likewise discussed and chose in the negative the inquiry, "Is a defensive levy adverse to the interests of the nation?"
