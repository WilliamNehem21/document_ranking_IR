Throughout much of the twentieth century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and military unrest. After Juan Vicente GÃ³mez's long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with Marcos PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez's overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were AcciÃ³n DemocrÃ¡tica and COPEI, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for AcciÃ³n DemocrÃ¡tica's Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez, Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the "Caracazo" engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.
Hugo ChÃ¡vez, then a Lieutenant Colonel in the army, had formed a secret revolutionary group (MBR-200) in the early 1980s and was planning a "rebellious intervention". He later felt the "Caracazo" was a missed opportunity for his movement. Three years later, ChÃ¡vez saw another chance; in February 1992, he led an unsuccessful military coup d'Ã©tat and was imprisoned. A second coup attempt, without his involvement, also failed. ChÃ¡vez enjoyed some popular support for his actions. Released from prison in 1994, he recast his revolutionary group as a legitimate socialist political party, the Fifth Republic Movement. The movement adopted former Venezuelan leader SimÃ³n BolÃ­var as its "iconic hero" and "reference point"; BolÃ­var had played a key role in Latin America's successful struggle for independence from Spain in the 1820s. In the 1998 presidential election, ChÃ¡vez won 56.2% of the vote, on a promise to "end the corruption of several decades" and institute a new Bolivarian Revolution that he felt would secure Latin America's true independence from the outside world.
