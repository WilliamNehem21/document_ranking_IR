Lawrence made her film debut in the 2008 drama film "Garden Party", in which she played a troubled teenager named Tiff. She then appeared in director Guillermo Arriaga's feature film debut "The Burning Plain" (2008), a drama narrated in a hyperlink format. She was cast as the teenage daughter of Kim Basinger's character who discovers her mother's extramarital affairâa role she shared with Charlize Theron; both actresses portrayed the role at different stages of the character's life. Mark Feeney for "The Boston Globe" thought of Lawrence's performance as "a thankless task", but Derek Elley from "Variety" praised her as the production's prime asset, writing that she "plumbs fresher depths" into the film. Her performance earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Emerging Actress at the Venice Film Festival. Also that year, she appeared in the music video for the song "The Mess I Made" by Parachute. The following year, she starred in Lori Petty's drama "The Poker House" as the oldest of three sisters living with a drug-abusing mother. Stephen Farber of "The Hollywood Reporter" thought that Lawrence "has a touching poise on camera that conveys the resilience of children", and her role in "The Poker House" won an Outstanding Performance award from the Los Angeles Film Festival.
