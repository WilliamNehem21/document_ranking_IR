In 1960 Hordern played Admiral Sir John Tovey in the British war film "Sink the Bismarck!", in light of the book "Most recent Nine Days of the Bismarck" by C. S. Forester and with a plot reminiscent of his maritime days. With a couple of littler jobs in the middle of, Hordern began take a shot at the American epic chronicled dramatization film "Cleopatra". It was made in 1962 and as indicated by the performing artist, was "the most phenomenal bit of film-production in which I had the joy to participate". He played the Roman speaker Cicero and was procured on an eight-week contract which because of different difficulties, including cast affliction and unfavorable climate conditions, was stretched out to nine months. A lot to Hordern's inconvenience, the film would expect him to by and by work with Rex Harrison, who was given a role as Caesar. In spite of the enmity between them, they consented to bear each other's organization for the film. The understanding was fleeting; Harrison made an inebriated joke at a cast supper about "Nina" which incited Hordern to strike him. The occurrence nearly brought about Hordern's expulsion, however the issue was immediately settled by makers and the two were kept separate in the middle of recording. In 1993 Hordern asserted the occurrence had "dispelled any confusion air" among them and they in the long run progressed toward becoming companions. After "Cleopatra's" discharge, Hordern made an arrival to films, showing up in "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" (1965), "How I Won the War" (1967), and "Where Eagles Dare" in 1968. He likewise highlighted in the Roman joke "A Funny Thing Happened while in transit to the Forum" in 1966.
