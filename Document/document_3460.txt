The Two Medicine Formation is exemplified by a warm semiarid atmosphere. Its layers were dismissed on the east shoreline of the Laramidia island mainland (which comprised of western North America). The high cordillera in the west, joined with overwhelmingly western breezes, would have caused a downpour shadow, restricting yearly precipitation. Downpour would for the most part have fallen amid the late spring, when convection storms overwhelmed the scene. The atmosphere would along these lines additionally have been extremely occasional, with a long dry season and a short wet season. Vegetation would have been scanty and minimal changed. In such conditions, horned dinosaurs would have been reliant on oxbow lakes for a ceaseless supply of water and sustenance Ã¢ÂÂ the principle stream channels tending to run dry before Ã¢ÂÂ and died in them amid serious dry seasons when the creatures focused around the last watering openings, making bone beds structure. The dark colored paleosol in which the horned dinosaurs were found Ã¢ÂÂ a blend of mud and coalified wood sections Ã¢ÂÂ looks like that of present day regularly dry marshes. The encompassing vegetation may have comprised of about high conifer trees. "Achelousaurus" ate a lot littler plants, however: a recent report verified that ceratopsid herbivores on Laramidia were confined to benefiting from vegetation with a stature of or lower.
