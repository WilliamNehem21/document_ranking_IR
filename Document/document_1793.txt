On 27 May 1768, Cook took order of "Baron of Pembroke", esteemed in March at ÃÂ£2,307. 5s. 6d. at the end of the day obtained for ÃÂ£2,840. 10s. 11d. also, alloted for use in the Society's campaign. She was refitted at Deptford on the River Thames for the total of ÃÂ£2,294, nearly the cost of the ship itself. The frame was sheathed and caulked to secure against shipworm, and a third inner deck introduced to give lodges, a powder magazine and storerooms. The new lodges gave around of floorspace each and were distributed to Cook and the Royal Society agents: naturalist Joseph Banks, Banks' associates Daniel Solander and Herman SpÃÂ¶ring, space expert Charles Green, and craftsmen Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan. These lodges circled the officer's chaos. The Great Cabin at the back of the deck was structured as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society. On the back lower deck, lodges looking on to the mate's wreckage were alloted to Lieutenants Zachary Hickes and John Gore, ship's specialist William Monkhouse, the heavy weapons specialist Stephen Forwood, ship's lord Robert Molyneux, and the skipper's representative Richard Orton. The abutting open wreckage deck gave resting and living quarters to the marines and group, and extra room.
