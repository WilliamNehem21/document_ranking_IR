A prior draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird", titled "Go Set a Watchman", was dubiously discharged on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was finished in 1957, is set 20 years after the timeframe portrayed in "To Kill a Mockingbird" however isn't a continuation of the account. This prior form of the story pursues a grown-up Scout Finch who goes from New York City to visit her dad, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is stood up to by the bigotry in her locale. The "Gatekeeper" composition was accepted to have been lost until Lee's attorney Tonja Carter found it, however this case has been broadly debated. "Guardian" contains early forms of a large number of the characters from "To Kill a Mockingbird". As indicated by Lee's operator Andrew Nurnberg, "Mockingbird" was initially proposed to be the principal book of a set of three: "They examined distributing "Mockingbird" first, "Guardian" last, and a shorter associating novel between the two." This attestation has been undermined, be that as it may, by uncommon books master James S. Jaffe, who checked on the pages in line with Lee's lawyer and observed them to be just another draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird". Nurnberg's announcement was likewise in opposition to Jonathan Mahler's portrayal of how "Guardian" was viewed as simply the principal draft of "Mockingbird".
