In 1992, Thomas Bolliger described some teeth of "Seorsumuscardinus" from the Swiss locality of TÃ¤gernaustrasse (MN 4; early Miocene, see MN zonation) as an indeterminate dormouse (family Gliridae) perhaps related to "Eomuscardinus". Six years later, Hans de Bruijn named the new genus and species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" on the basis of material from Oberdorf in Austria (also MN 4) and included fossils from TÃ¤gernaustrasse and from Karydia in Greece (MN 4) in "Seorsumuscardinus". In 2007, Jerome Prieto and Madeleine BÃ¶hme named "Heissigia bolligeri" as a new genus and species from Affalterbach in Bavaria (MN 5, younger than MN 4), and referred the TÃ¤gernaustrasse material to it, but failed to compare their new genus to "Seorsumuscardinus". Two years later, Prieto published a note to compare the two and concluded that they were referable to the same genus, but different species. Thus, the genus "Seorsumuscardinus" now includes the species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" from MN 4 and "S.Â bolligeri" from MN 5. Prieto provisionally placed the TÃ¤gernaustrasse material with "S.Â alpinus". He also mentioned "Pentaglis fÃ¶ldvÃ¡ry", a name given to a single upper molar from the middle Miocene of Hungary, which is now lost. Although the specimen shows some similarities with "Seorsumuscardinus", published illustrations are too poor to confirm the identity of "Pentaglis", and Prieto considered the latter name to be an unidentifiable "nomen dubium".
