Travel essayist Cash Peters distinguishes six attributes basic to huge numbers of the gallery's works of art. The first is that MOBA specialists are unfit to render hands or feet, and cover them by broadening figures' arms off the canvas, concealing them with long sleeves, or setting shoes on feet in unseemly situations. Second, Peters thought about craftsmen Rembrandt and J. M. W. Turner, experts of scenes, who "could most likely paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA specialists who evidently painted with their eyes shut, as skies are frequently painted in any shading yet blue, verdure are made without reference to any current plant life forms, and fauna show up so little out of sight it is difficult to perceive what sort of creatures they are. Third, MOBA craftsmen apply point of view conflictingly, either starting with one painting then onto the next, or inside a solitary work. Diminishes' fourth perception concerns the trouble MOBA specialists appear to have in effectively rendering noses: he composes that a nose will be endeavored so often that the work takes on a third measurement as paint is reapplied again and again. Fifth, awful craftsmen support "blended media": if all else fails, they stick quills, sparkle, or hair to their work. Finally, Peters recommends that specialists realize their work is terrible, yet obviously feel the piece might be spared by including a monkey or a poodle in the creation.
