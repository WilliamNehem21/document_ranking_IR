Around twenty teeth and a jaw section have been alluded to "Ferugliotherium", yet the task of a large number of these is dubious or has been supplanted. The upper and lower incisors are long and rat like and have lacquer on just a single side of the crown. A section of the lower jaw demonstrates that the tooth attachment of the lower incisor was long, stretching out underneath the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is saved in this part. It is sharp edge formed and takes after multituberculate p4s. In any case, the assurance of this fossil as "Ferugliotherium" is being referred to. The character of a couple of extra secluded premolars doled out to "Ferugliotherium", some taking after multituberculates, is additionally questionable. The principal lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four precedents, of which two were initially recognized as upper molars of an alternate animal types ("Vucetichia gracilis"), which is currently viewed as an equivalent word of "Ferugliotherium". They bear two longitudinal lines of three or four cusps and transverse peaks and wrinkles. A solitary precedent every one of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) get defensive likewise had longitudinal cusp columns and transverse wrinkles and peaks, however the mf2 had just two or maybe three cusps for every line and the MF1 had three longitudinal lines.
