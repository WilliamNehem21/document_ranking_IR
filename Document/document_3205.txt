McClellan was additionally lucky that the disappointment of the battle left his military for the most part flawless, in light of the fact that he was commonly missing from the battling and fail to name any second-in-order who may coordinate his retreat. Military student of history Stephen W. Singes stated, "When he abandoned his military on the Glendale and Malvern Hill front lines amid the Seven Days, he was blameworthy of neglect of obligation. Had the Army of the Potomac been destroyed on both of these fields (at Glendale the likelihood had been genuine), that charge under the Articles of War would probably have been brought against him." In the skirmish of Glendale, McClellan was five miles (8ÃÂ km) away behind Malvern Hill, without broadcast interchanges and too far off to even think about commanding his military. In the skirmish of Malvern Hill, he was on a gunboat, the U.S.S. "Galena", which at one point was ten miles (16ÃÂ km) away, down the James River. In the two fights, compelling direction of the military tumbled to his companion and V Corps administrator Brigadier General Fitz John Porter. At the point when the open found out about the "Galena", it was one more incredible shame, similar to the Quaker Guns at Manassas. Publication kid's shows distributed over the span of the 1864 presidential crusade ridiculed McClellan for having favored the wellbeing of a ship while a fight was battled out there.
