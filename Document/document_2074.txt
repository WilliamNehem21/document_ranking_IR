In 1143, Nigel ended up engaged with a squabble with the incredible Henry of Blois. Charges of denying a cleric of a congregation, giving church property to laymen, and empowering subversion were brought against Nigel, and he was compelled to go to Rome to shield himself, just achieving Rome in 1144. He didn't come back to his bishopric until 1145. He most likely went with Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who went to Rome around this time on independent business. While he was in Rome, Pope Lucius II issued various decisions to support Nigel, requesting his compensation to Ely. He was then at long last accommodated with Stephen by paying a fine of ÃÂ£200 and offering his child Richard fitzNeal as a prisoner. While Nigel was at Rome, Ely was assaulted by the lord's powers. The priests sent to Geoffrey de Mandeville for help, and Geoffrey came and involved the Isle of Ely, while the lord's powers involved the terrains of the see outside the Isle. Both possessing powers damaged to the terrains of the bishopric and the house of God section. The priests, in the "Liber Eliensis", grumbled that Nigel had taken things from the congregation to fund his outing to Rome, and that they were required to help add to the influence when Nigel was accommodated with Stephen.
