In 2007, two groups of researchers autonomously named the Indian gondwanathere based on new material; the two groups included VPL/JU/NKIM/25 in their recently named species. Guntupalli Prasad and partners named the creature "Bharattherium bonapartei" based on an extra tooth, VPL/JU/IM/33, from another Intertrappean area, Kisalpuri. The nonexclusive name, "Bharattherium", joins "Bharat", Sanskrit for "India", with the Ancient Greek "therion", signifying "monster", and the particular name, "bonapartei", praises Argentine scientist JosÃÂ© Bonaparte, who was the first to portray a gondwanathere fossil. G.P. Wilson and partners named "Dakshina jederi" based on six teeth (notwithstanding VPL/JU/NKIM 25), and distinguished some extra material as uncertain gondwanatheres. Of these teeth, three (GSI/SR/PAL-G059, G070, and G074) are from a third Intertrappean site at Gokak and three (GSI/SR/PAL-N071, N210, and N212) are from Naskal. "Dakshina", the conventional name, gets from Sanskrit "daakshinaatya" "of the south", and alludes both to the creature's event in southern India and to the circulation of gondwanatheres in the southern landmasses. The particular name, "jederi", respects University of Michigan scientist Jeffrey A. Wilson, nicknamed "Jeder", who assumed an essential job in the task that prompted the disclosure of "Dakshina". Wilson and partners likewise portrayed three other gondwanathere teeth from Gokak (GSI/SR/PAL-G111, G112, and G211), which they probably recognized as an alternate types of gondwanathere on their little size. In 2008, Prasad remarked that "Bharattherium bonapartei" and "Dakshina jederi" spoke to similar species and that "Bharattherium", which was distributed first, was the right name.
