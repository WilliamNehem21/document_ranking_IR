The decision of plutonium for the fissile part of the bomb implied that Penney's HER group at Fort Halstead needed to structure an implosion-type atomic weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had tackled the issue of doing this with touchy focal points. The association of a few British researchers gave HER a strong base of understanding to work from. The British structure would slash to that of the American Fat Man as intently as could be expected under the circumstances. A critical change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD item, for Composition B as the quick unstable segment of the focal points; Baratol would in any case give the moderate segment. This was dealt with by the explosives specialists at Woolwich, who contrived the machining forms and created models of the focal points and shape. Creation was then dealt with by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The main focal points were conveyed in 1952, and there were sufficient for two sets for the Operation Hurricane congregations. Woolwich gave the supercharge, the round shell of unstable that encases the alter. Test firings of hazardous focal points were led at Foulness by a group under the heading of Roy Pilgrim. To accomplish close concurrent explosions of the focal points, the Americans had built up the detonating bridgewire detonator; this must be copied. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean created them, while Challens concocted the terminating circuits.
