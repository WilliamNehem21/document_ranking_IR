The front piece of the skull is eminently wide. As in "Holochilus", the zygomatic plate, the leveled front segment of the cheek bone, is far reaching and created into a spinous procedure at the foremost edge. The jugal bone is little, however less decreased than in "Holochilus". The interorbital area of the skull is tight and flanked by high dots. The sharp foramina, which puncture the sense of taste between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, reaching out between the molars. The sense of taste itself is additionally long, stretching out past the back edge of the maxillary bones, and it is punctured close to the third molars by obvious posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone comes up short on a suspensory procedure that contacts the tegmen tympani, the top of the tympanic hole, yet "Lundomys" is unordinary in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani for the most part cover when seen from the side. In the mandible, the rakish and coronoid forms are less very much created than in "Holochilus". The capsular procedure of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, close to the coronoid procedure, is little. The two masseteric edges, to which a portion of the biting muscles are appended, are completely discrete, joining just at their foremost edges, which are situated underneath the principal molar.
