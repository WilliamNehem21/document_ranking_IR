By watercraft, the separation among Dakar and Carabane is , in spite of the fact that Ziguinchor is just away. Before the dispatch of the "Joola", different water crafts, for the most part well-worn ones, made the association: first "Top Skirring", at that point the "Casamance Express", and after that "Island Karabane". In January 1991, a spic and span ship went into task. Like its forerunners, it associated Dakar to Ziguinchor, ceasing close Carabane where kayaks could achieve the island. On September 26, 2002, 180 additional travelers boarded the officially over-burden transport at this stop, and a couple of hours after the fact, the "Joola" sank. For security reasons, the "Joola's" successor, the "Wilis", quit calling at Carabane, to the incredible disappointment of the occupants. Sightseers ended up uncommon from that point forward, and every now and then, occupants of the island thought that it was important to move to Dakar or Ziguinchor. Huge changes to the MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta", which supplanted the "Wilis" in March 2008, were considered to enable it to stop securely at the island, and the development of a billet was declared. Souleymane NdÃÂ©nÃÂ© Ndiaye, who later wound up Prime Minister of Senegal, laid the primary stone of the compartment in July 2008, and the whole development venture was financed by the Senegalese government at an expected expense of 12 billion West African CFA francs. On April 26, 2014, the MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta" ceased at the Carabane billet out of the blue, improving transportation for local people and sightseers. , the ship stops at Carabane multiple times every week amidst its excursions among Dakar and Ziguinchor.
