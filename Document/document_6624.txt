The tail club (or tail handle) of "Ankylosaurus" was made out of two huge osteoderms, with a line of little osteoderms at the midline, and two little osteoderms at the tip; these osteoderms clouded the last tail vertebra. As just the tail club of example AMNH 5214 is known, the scope of variety between people is obscure. The tail club of AMNH 5214 is long, wide, and tall. The club of the biggest example may have been wide. The tail club of "Ankylosaurus" was half circle when seen from above, like those of "Euoplocephalus" and "Scolosaurus" yet not at all like the pointed club osteoderms of "Anodontosaurus" or the tight, lengthened club of "Dyoplosaurus". The last seven tail vertebrae framed the "handle" of the tail club. These vertebrae were in contact, with no ligament among them, and were now and again co-solidified, which made them stable. Hardened ligaments joined to the vertebrae before the tail club, and these highlights together fortified it. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular procedures) and neural spines of the handle vertebrae were U-formed when seen from above, while those of most different ankylosaurids are V-molded, which might be because of the handle of "Ankylosaurus" being more extensive. The bigger width may show that the tail of "Ankylosaurus" was shorter in connection to its body length than those of different ankylosaurids, or that it had similar extents however with a littler club.
