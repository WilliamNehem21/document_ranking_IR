The later profession of Sir Andrew Baynton, with whom Pleydell had filled in as Member for Marlborough, was dominated by money related trouble. In an apparent endeavor to pick up court support and pay off his obligations, Baynton depended Thomas Seymour with his properties (probably briefly). At the point when Seymour was executed for conspiracy in 1549, the terrains fell into the ownership of the crown. Ruler Mary arranged their deal to a few individuals from the Wiltshire upper class, including Nicholas Snell and Pleydell. Gabriel would procure the homes of the Bremhill and Bromham areas in 1562. Pleydell is thought to have gone further in the quest for Baynton's domains; he and Henry Sharington were to be the agents of his will upon his demise in 1564. Allocating themselves his properties in Chippenham, the couple (portrayed by Alison Wall in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" as "reprobates" and by R. J. W. Swales as "deceitful globe-trotters") guided Baynton's cash and domains to themselves, as opposed to his proposed entailment of the resources for his sibling Edward. Sharington has subsequently been portrayed by Wall as "degenerate" and Pleydell as "famous"; as per Bindoff, the activity "confirm[s] for Gabriel Pleydell a specialty in parliamentary history, detract[ing] still further from his notoriety". Pleydell discharged any titles acquired from the gained bequests, which incorporated the estates of the Clench and Stanley villas, to Edward Baynton (Andrew's sibling) on 19 July 1566 and the Privy Council in this way dismissed charges of fabrication against him. Edward had for some time been suspicious of Pleydell and Sharington, and brought a fruitless fraud charge against them to a privilege court as ahead of schedule as July 1560. He likewise requested an assault on Pleydell's workers after his procurement of the Bremhill and Bromham properties.
