Amid generation, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin planned the "Ulysses" on paper, Greg Aronowitz was contracted to manufacture a scale model of the submarine, to be utilized as a kind of perspective for illustration the 3D "Ulysses". The last film included 362 computerized impacts shots, and PC programs were utilized to flawlessly join the 2D and 3D fine art. One scene that exploited this was the "sub-drop" scene, where the 3D "Ulysses" was dropped from its docking cove into the water. As the camera glided toward it, a 2D Milo was attracted to show up inside, following the camera. The team noticed that it was trying to shield the gathering of people from seeing the distinction between the 2D and 3D illustrations when they were combined. The advanced generation likewise gave the executives a one of a kind "virtual camera" for entangled shots inside the film. With the capacity to work in the z-plane, this camera traveled through an advanced wire-outline set; the foundation and subtleties were later hand-drawn over the wire outlines.
