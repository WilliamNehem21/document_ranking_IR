He had given a meeting to writer Edward B. Clark, who cited Roosevelt in the article "Roosevelt on the Nature Fakers" in the June 1907 issue of "Everyone's Magazine". Roosevelt took a stand in opposition to Long, however different creators like Jack London and Roberts, who composed what he called "'unnatural' history". Roosevelt advanced the expression "nature faker" over Clark's unique spelling, and characterized it in his article as "an object of criticism to each researcher deserving of the name, to each genuine admirer of the wild, to each faunal naturalist, to each obvious seeker or nature sweetheart. In any case, it is obvious that [the nature faker] totally bamboozles numerous great individuals who are entirely insensible of untamed life. Here and there he draws without anyone else creative ability for his fictions; once in a while he gets them second-hand from untrustworthy aides or trappers or Indians." He voiced dismay with and incredulity of London's portrayals of puppy battling in "White Fang", just as Long's tales about Wayeeses the wolf bringing down prey; Roosevelt was so explicit as to discuss the delineated result of the battles dependent on the extent of the creatures included. Long's books specifically were regarded an "authentic wrongdoing", particularly against the nation's kids. Expecting that an educational modules including wistful nature stories would degenerate youthful kids, Roosevelt expressed: "Concerning the matter of giving these books to kids to teach them the certainties of regular historyÃ¢ÂÂwhy, it's a shock."
