A gathering supporting the reclamation of the trench had been set up in the mid 1950s autonomously of the Inland Waterways Association, with which it was accordingly consolidated. In 1955 John Gould, a broker on the eastern area of the conduit, effectively requested of against the commission's inability to keep up the conduit and acquired harms for loss of business. In March 1956 a condition in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was introduced to Parliament that would have expelled the privilege of route among Reading and Bath. The Act was contradicted by Gould and by the nearby specialists along the waterway. They were bolstered by a 22,000-signature appeal to the Queen, conveyed to London from Bristol by water; portions of the waterway must be crossed by kayak. This battle prompted a request by a Parliamentary Select Committee. The council bolstered the suspension of the privilege of route, and the Bill went through the House of Commons however was altered by the House of Lords to incorporate a condition to authorize "no further decay". In July 1958, the Bowes Committee distributed their "Investigation into Inland Waterways" which explicitly referenced the Kennet and Avon finding "no support for reestablishing the area from Reading to Bath".
