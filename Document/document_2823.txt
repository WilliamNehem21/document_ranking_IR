Clark was conceived Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His dad Benjamin passed on December 6, 1948; his mom at that point moved the family to Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made for an assortment of reasons, including getting away from the more prominent typical cost for basic items in a vast city, for example, Chicago, the help Veneta's family in Arkansas could give, and her sentiment of being an untouchable to the remaining Kanne family as she didn't share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta wedded Viktor Clark, whom she met while functioning as a secretary at a bank. Viktor brought up Wesley as his child, and authoritatively embraced him on Wesley's sixteenth birthday celebration. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name really supplanted that of Wesley's organic dad on his introduction to the world testament, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without letting him know of his Jewish heritage to shield him from the counter Jewish exercises of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. In spite of the fact that his mom was Methodist, Clark picked a Baptist church in the wake of moving to Little Rock and kept going to it all through his youth.
