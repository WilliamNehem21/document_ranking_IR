At the following court session on July 15, examiners submitted proof that V. N. had gotten 13,500US$ from an obscure source just before she abjured the charges amid the May court session. The indictment presented the proof trying to demonstrate that V. N's. unique articulations and want to press the charges were legitimate, and later endeavors to abnegate were in dishonesty. Darker at that point stood up yet wouldn't respond to inquiries concerning why his underlying explanations to Japanese police were unique in relation to what Takaesu later expressed in court had really occurred on the night being referred to. The investigator asked Brown, "Your unique articulation that she made lewd gestures was false?" Brown answered, "I am not going to answer that." When inquired as to why he would not reply, Brown answered, "In light of the fact that I need the open door for this court to see freely the sort of debasement and twisting of proof by the police and the examiner." Takaesu later said that another purpose behind Brown's refusal to respond to the majority of the inquiries was on the grounds that his answers could be utilized by the USMC in discrete military equity activities against Brown.
