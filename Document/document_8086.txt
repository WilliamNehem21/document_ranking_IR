Borah would not face leaving the Republican Party and did not bolster any of the presidential competitors (the Democrats assigned New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). At the point when Roosevelt came to Boise on a crusade swing in October, Borah felt he needed to welcome the previous president and sit on the stage as Roosevelt talked, however he was reluctant to embrace him. Roosevelt told in his discourse of a not insignificant rundown of state delegate cast a ballot he said had been stolen from him, and after each, swung to Borah and asked, "Isn't that in this way, Senator Borah?" giving him no decision however to gesture. It isn't certain whether Borah voted in favor of Roosevelt or Taft, he later expressed both at various occasions. The fundamental issue in Idaho was Borah's re-appointment, which was popular to the point that those disappointed at the congressperson for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt stayed silent. Idahoans helped choose Wilson, however sent 80 Republican lawmakers out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats swore to help Borah if essential), who on January 14, 1913 returned William Borah for a second term.
