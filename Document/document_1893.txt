The first parkway along a significant part of the USÃÂ 113 passage was a post street built up in the late 18thÃÂ century that associated Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, at last prompting Wilmington and Philadelphia. The DoverÃ¢ÂÂ Milford part of the post street pursued the King's Highway set up in the late 17thÃÂ century to interface Dover with Lewes, the first area seat of Sussex County. South of Milford, the post street pursued a phase street from Dover to Dagsboro developed to interface the new district seat of Georgetown with Dover during the 1790s. A 1796 demonstration of the Delaware General Assembly called for studying a straighter clear way in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, an interstate that wound up known as the State Road by the mid-19thÃÂ century. In Maryland, the post street pursued what is currently MDÃÂ 12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton to Snow Hill and the Old Stage Road from north of Showell to the Delaware state line, and a different street associated Pocomoke City and Snow Hill. By 1898, the earth street from Pocomoke City to Berlin by means of Snow Hill was the primary lane of Worcester County.
