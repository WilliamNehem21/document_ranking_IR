A workmanship history specialist outlined this lyricism, composing that Knaths' way to deal with Cubism was sentimental as opposed to scholastic or exacting. Another composed that Knaths' artworks are close to home articulations of both hypothesis and feeling which emerge from his affection for nature, his nearby security with his locale, and a "graceful reflection on human life."

The unlooked-for things that occur during the time spent work are the vital ones." A nitty gritty depiction of Knaths' use of hypothesis to his routine with regards to craftsmanship is given in "Four American Expressionists: Doris Caesar, Chaim Gross, Karl Knaths, Abraham Rattner", pp.ÃÂ 16Ã¢ÂÂ 17 (New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1959) and furthermore in "Karl Knaths To Teach at Art Gallery," Alice Graeme, "The Washington Post", February 20, 1938, p.
