Several of the songs on "In Utero" had been written years prior to recording; some of them dated back to 1990. With tracks like "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle", Cobain favored long song titles in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that utilized single-word titles. Cobain continued to work on the lyrics while recording at Pachyderm Studio. Nonetheless, Cobain told Darcey Steinke in "Spin" in 1993 that, in contrast to "Bleach" and "Nevermind", the lyrics were "more focused, they're almost built on themes." Michael Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs. Azerrad also noted that "[v]irtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease". In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books he had read. "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle" was inspired by "Shadowland", a 1978 biography of actress Frances Farmer, with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school. The song "Scentless Apprentice" was written about "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer", a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the "ultimate perfume" by killing virgin women and taking their scent.
