In December 1967, the gathering included guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth individual from Pink Floyd. Gilmour definitely knew Barrett, having examined with him at Cambridge Tech in the mid 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later bummed a ride and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while an individual from Joker's Wild, Gilmour had viewed the Tea Set. Morrison's right hand, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's home with a pay of ÃÂ£30 every week (), and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises declared Gilmour as the band's most up to date part; the second guitarist and its fifth part, the band proposing to proceed with Barrett as a nonperforming lyricist. Jenner remarked: "The thought was that Dave wouldÃÂ ... spread for [Barrett's] whimsies and when that got the opportunity to be not serviceable, Syd was simply going to compose. Just to attempt to keep him included". In a statement of his dissatisfaction, Barrett, who was relied upon to review extra hit singles to pursue "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", rather presented "Have You Got It Yet?" to the band, deliberately changing the structure on every execution to make the melody difficult to pursue and learn. In a January 1968 photograph shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photos show Barrett looking withdrew from the others, gazing into the separation.
