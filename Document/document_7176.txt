After Lemaire resigned from training, the Devils declared that the group's untouched driving scorer, John MacLean, would turn into their new head mentor. Amid the off-season, the Devils marked Kovalchuk to a 15-year, $100ÃÂ million contract, keeping him in New Jersey until the finish of the 2024Ã¢ÂÂ 25 season; the move came after the NHL had rejected a 17-year contract for purportedly bypassing the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The League still punished the Devils for endeavoring to dodge the NHL compensation top with a cash fine, a third-round draft pick in 2011 and one future first-round pick inside the following four seasons. MacLean drove the group to a record of 9Ã¢ÂÂ 22Ã¢ÂÂ 2, and in the wake of sitting in last spot in the NHL on December 23, he was evacuated for Lemaire, leaving retirement for his third stretch as head mentor of the Devils and second in under two seasons. Only a couple of days after the fact, battling commander Jamie Langenbrunner was exchanged back to Dallas after nine seasons with New Jersey. With the harmed Parise missing a large portion of the ordinary season, the group battled obnoxiously, completing toward the end in objectives scored. In spite of this, the Devils dealt with a mid-season turnaround, winning 22 out of the following 25 diversions. Be that as it may, the Devils still neglected to meet all requirements for the playoffs out of the blue since 1996, finishing their 13-year streak.
