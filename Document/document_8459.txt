"Exercises for Children" and "Psalms in Prose" had, for kids' books, an extraordinary effect; in addition to the fact that they influenced the verse of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Jane Taylor, they were likewise used to show a few ages of schoolchildren. Youngsters' writing researcher William McCarthy states, "Elizabeth Barrett Browning could in any case quote the opening lines of "Exercises for Children" at age thirty-nine." Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox criticized Barbauld's kids' books and trusted that she was squandering her gifts, Barbauld herself saw such composition as honorable and urged others to pursue her. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer clarifies, "She offered eminence to the composition of adolescent writing, and by not bringing down her standard of composing for youngsters, she propelled others to compose on a comparative elevated requirement." indeed, as a result of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were motivated to compose for poor kids just as sort out a substantial scale Sunday School development, Ellenor Fenn to compose and plan a progression of perusers and amusements for white collar class kids, and Richard Lovell Edgeworth to start one of the main deliberate investigations of youth advancement, which would come full circle in an instructive treatise wrote by Maria Edgeworth and him, and in a huge body of kids' accounts by Maria.
