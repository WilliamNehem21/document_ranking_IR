Wheatley had the best season of his career in the 2000 as Raiders went 12â4 and reached the American Football Conference championship game of the 2000â01 NFL playoffs. Wheatley amassed 1,046Â yards rushing and 9Â touchdowns on 232Â carries and added 20Â receptions for 156Â yards. Wheatley combined effectively with Kaufman to form an inside and outside attacking combination in these first two years. Wheatleyâs 4.5Â yards per carry ranked ninth in the NFL. Not only did Wheatley amass a career-high three 100-yard rushing games that season, but he also had his three highest career single-game performances: 156Â yards on only 15Â carries on October 22 at home against the Seattle Seahawks, 146Â yards on December 16 at Seattle and 112Â yards on November 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs. The 100-yard performances against Seattle were his second and third in his first four games against them as a Raider. In the playoffs, Wheatley only posted a total of 63Â yards rushing on 31 carries and one reception for four yards in two home playoff games. On January 6, 2001, Wheatley posted what would turn out to be his career (seven career games) playoff high 56Â yards rushing and his only playoff touchdown. In the January 14 conference championship against the Baltimore Ravens he only rushed for 7Â yards on 12 carries.
