The trials with "Chesma" greatly affected the armour protection design of the "Borodino"-class ships. The Krupp cemented-armour plates were resized to match the frames and provide support for their joints; they were also locked together with mortise-and-tenon joints to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact. The waterline belt covered the middle of the ship. It had a total height of , of which was above the design waterline and below. The remaining portion of the waterline was protected by plates. The upper belt was thick and had a height of . It thinned to 75Â millimetres forward of the casemates and extended all the way to the bow. The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upward extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates. Those casemates were protected by 100-millimetre transverse bulkheads. Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was thick between the middle and lower decks and decreased to between the middle and upper decks. The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75Â millimetres divided between a 50-millimetre plate of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC) layered above a 25-millimetre nickel-steel plate. The forward end of the armoured citadel was protected separately and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75Â millimetres thick. The rear bulkhead had no other protection and was thick between the middle and lower decks, decreasing to 75Â millimetres at the level of the armour belt.
