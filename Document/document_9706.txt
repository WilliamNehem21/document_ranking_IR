"Science Fantasy" was digest-sized for its initial two issues. The size expanded to a vast summary for the following four issues, yet with issue seven it came back to a little overview once more, and stayed in that position until the JuneÃ¢ÂÂ July 1964 issue, which was issued in soft cover design. The rest of the issues, including each one of those under the "Motivation" title, were distributed as soft cover books. It at first was estimated at 2/ - ; the cost was sliced to 1/6 for the third issue, yet came back to 2/ - with the seventh issue. With issue 11 (December 1954) the value came back to 2/ - , and it rose to 2/6 with issue 46 and to 3/ - with issue 61. At the point when the organization changed to soft cover with issue 65 the cost dropped again to 2/6, and stayed there until the title change to Impulse. All the twelve "Motivation" issues were estimated at 3/6. The page check started at 96, and rose to 128 with issue 7. Issues 36 through 63 were 112 pages, and the last overview estimated issue was 124 pages. The soft cover issues were 128 pages under the "Science Fantasy" title, and 160 pages for the "Drive" issues. Volume numbering started with two volumes of three issues, yet the second volume started with volume 2, number 4 as opposed to restarting the issue number at 1 as would generally be finished. From issue 7 the volume number was dropped totally.
