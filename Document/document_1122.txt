Inability to ensure the trustworthiness of its units was the most antagonistic of a few complaints felt by the territorials against what they saw as an unfriendly and disparaging disposition from the military experts. Regional officers and pros, for example, specialists, vets, drivers, cooks and dispatch riders got less pay than their partners in New Army and standard units. Officers were viewed as junior to their standard partners of a similar position, driving some to expel the 'T' symbol from their outfits as an identification of mediocrity, and administrators of second-line units and third-line contingents were a rank lower than their customary partners. In spite of the fact that the Territorial Force gave numerous officers to the customary armed force, not many were delegated to higher directions, regardless of pre-war guarantees by Haldane that they would be. In 1918, government endeavors to protect the military record on senior regional advancements neglected to recognize that most were brief and in home units. Ian Macpherson, Under-Secretary of State for War, yielded that only ten regional officers told detachments and just three had been elevated to most noteworthy evaluation of General Staff Officer. The territorials got inadequate acknowledgment for their initial excitement. The Army Council would not allow any extraordinary embellishments for the individuals who had acknowledged the Imperial Service Obligation before the war. The Territorial War Medal, granted to the individuals who had volunteered for administration abroad in the principal months of the war, was denied to volunteers who had been kept down despite the fact that they rendered precious administration preparing the remainder of the military. The individuals who served in India got no battle award.
