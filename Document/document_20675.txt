Before the 1987â88 NBA season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the Celtics did so in the 1969 NBA Finals. Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6Â points, 11.9Â assists, and 6.2Â rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury. In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4â3Â series against the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, who with players such as Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Vinnie Johnson and Dennis Rodman were known as the "Bad Boys" for their physical style of play. Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36Â points, 16Â rebounds, and 10Â assists, and led his team to a 108â105Â win. Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1Â points on .550Â shooting, 13.0Â assists, and 5.7Â rebounds per game. It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career.
