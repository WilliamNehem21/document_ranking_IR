According to special relativity, the energy of an object with rest mass "m" and speed "v" is given by , where "Î³" is the Lorentz factor defined above. When "v" is zero, "Î³" is equal to one, giving rise to the famous formula for massâenergy equivalence. The "Î³" factor approaches infinity as "v" approachesÂ "c", and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is experimentally established in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum.
More generally, it is normally impossible for information or energy to travel faster thanÂ "c". One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the relativity of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two eventsÂ A andÂ B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied byÂ "c" then there are frames of reference in whichÂ A precedesÂ B, others in whichÂ B precedesÂ A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster thanÂ "c" relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and causality would be violated. In such a frame of reference, an "effect" could be observed before its "cause". Such a violation of causality has never been recorded, and would lead to paradoxes such as the tachyonic antitelephone.
