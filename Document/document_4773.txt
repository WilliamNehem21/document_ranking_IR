Subside's first exercise started the morning after Zotov was delegated. After the books were sprinkled with heavenly water, Zotov started his guidance; first in the letters in order, and after that the Prayer Book. He showed the Bible, from which Peter adapted long entries that he could at present discuss from memory forty years after the fact. Zotov additionally shown his understudy to sing, and in his later years Peter regularly precipitously went with choirs at faith gatherings. Albeit at first entrusted just to show perusing and composing, Zotov observed Peter to be mentally inquisitive, and intrigued by all that he could give. Dwindle requested exercises on Russian history, fights, and saints. At Zotov's solicitation, the Tsaritsa requested inscriptions of "remote urban areas and royal residences, cruising boats, weapons and verifiable occasions" to be brought from the Ordnance Office. Zotov set them in the examination room, alongside a fairly precise globe for the time, to occupy Peter when he ended up exhausted with his investigations. Other casual "alternative" coaches (remote and residential) and hirelings, were acquired for boisterous open air recreations with live ammo. They were likewise to teach Peter in different subjects, for example, imperial and military history, blacksmithing, carpentry, joinery, printing, and, uncommonly for Russian respectability at the time, cruising and shipbuilding.
