Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practical speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. "New Zealand" and "Indomitable" were the slowest of Beatty's ships, and gradually fell behind the newer battlecruisers. Despite this, "New Zealand" was able to open fire on "BlÃ¼cher" by 9:35, and continued to engage the armoured cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour, "New Zealand" had knocked out "BlÃ¼cher"s forward turret, and "Indomitable" began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced the German ship's armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room four minutes later. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port turrets, while the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed dropped to , and jammed her steering gear. At 10:48, Beatty ordered "Indomitable" to attack her, but the combination of a signalling error by Beatty's flag lieutenant and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship "Lion", which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards, caused the rest of the British battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in "New Zealand", to think that that signal applied to them. In response, they turned away from Hipper's main body and engaged "BlÃ¼cher". "New Zealand" fired 147 shells at "BlÃ¼cher" before the German ship capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed by "Arethusa". Captain Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform during the battle, and the lack of damage to "New Zealand" was once more attributed to its good luck properties.
