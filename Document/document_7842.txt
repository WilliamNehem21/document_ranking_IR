In 1880, Wallace distributed the book "Island Life" as a spin-off of "The Geographical Distribution of Animals". It overviewed the dispersion of both creature and plant species on islands. Wallace grouped islands into three unique sorts. Maritime islands, for example, the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (at that point known as the Sandwich Islands) framed in mid-sea and never part of any vast mainland. Such islands were described by a total absence of earthly warm blooded creatures and creatures of land and water, and their occupants (with the exemptions of transient winged animals and species presented by human action) were commonly the aftereffect of inadvertent colonization and consequent development. He isolated mainland islands into two separate classes relying upon whether they had as of late been a piece of a landmass (like Britain) or substantially less as of late (like Madagascar) and talked about how that distinction influenced the widely varied vegetation. He discussed how segregation influenced development and how that could result in the protection of classes of creatures, for example, the lemurs of Madagascar that were remainders of once far reaching mainland faunas. He widely talked about how changes of atmosphere, especially times of expanded glaciation, may have influenced the appropriation of greenery on certain islands, and the principal bit of the book examines conceivable reasons for these incredible ice ages. "Island Life" was viewed as an imperative work at the season of its distribution. It was examined widely in logical circles both in distributed audits and in private correspondence.
