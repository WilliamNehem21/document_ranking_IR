In surveying the debut arrival of "Shojo Beat", IGN's Jessica Chobot pointedly condemned the magazine. She felt it looked and read "like a teenie-bopper magazine" and alluded to the issue's spread as a "splendid, hot-pink, headache instigating, bubble-lettered scene". She considered the substance exhausting, and couldn't help contradicting Viz's choice of arrangement, taking note of, "it's as though Viz had taken everything from their upheld up reject heap and attempted to pull one over on the female people. 90% of what I was perusing was either ineffectively drawn or inadequately composed (as a general rule, it was both)." "Comic World News"' David Welsh dissented, as he felt that the magazine had a few decent arrangement, and he applauded "Nana", "Total Boyfriend" and "Blood red Hero" as the best three arrangement of the underlying issue. Greg McElhatton, fellow benefactor of "" and previous analyst for iComics.com, adulated the magazine's standard appearance, considering it a "brilliant" choice, as it would attract its intended interest group by outwardly demonstrating to them that it's a magazine for young ladies. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the debut issue had powerless openings, he found that the magazine was "set for a decent, if not extraordinary begin".
