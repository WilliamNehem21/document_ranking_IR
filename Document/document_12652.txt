The book takes its name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, North East England, in whose tomb it was set, most likely a couple of years after his passing in 687. In spite of the fact that it was for quite some time viewed as Cuthbert's own duplicate of the Gospel, to which there are early references, thus a relic of the holy person, the book is currently thought to date from soon after Cuthbert's passing. It was likely a blessing from MonkwearmouthÃ¢ÂÂ Jarrow Abbey, where it was composed, planned to be set in St Cuthbert's pine box in the couple of decades after this was set behind the special stepped area at Lindisfarne in 698. It probably stayed in the casket through its long goes after 875, constrained by Viking attacks, finishing at Durham Cathedral. The book was found inside the pine box and expelled in 1104 when the internment was indeed moved inside the house of God. It was kept there with different relics, and imperative guests had the capacity to wear the book in a calfskin sack around their necks. It is suspected that after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England by Henry VIII somewhere in the range of 1536 and 1541, the book go to authorities. It was in the long run given to Stonyhurst College, the Jesuit school in Lancashire.
