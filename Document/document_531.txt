Performing artist Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) condemned the early stories as exhausting and lacking captivating substance. She felt that early "Endeavor" contents disregarded essential principles of "Star Trek" order, and offered "uncovering outfits rather than character improvement". UPN officials expressed that the male-situated scenes of "Big business" did not work with the viewership of its other top shows, for example, "Top Model" and "Veronica Mars". Brannon Braga proposed that the explanation behind the wiping out was watcher weariness, taking note of that "following 18 years and 624 hours of "Star Trek", the group of onlookers started to have a tad of needless excess." Fans, in the mean time, scrutinized Berman and Braga for overlooking "Star Trek" ordinance and declining to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news facilitator for SyFy Portal, expressed that notwithstanding the oversaturation of "Star Trek", there "additionally is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't kick back and state, 'You know, we can't keep this new.' No, it was increasingly about their inept consciences, and their irrational 'Regardless of whether it's penniless, don't fix it' frame of mind." Braga guarded the arrangement, taking note of that "The Next Generation" confronted little challenge from other sci-fi appears, while "Undertaking" needed to fight with a plenty of shows, for example, "Battlestar Galactica".
