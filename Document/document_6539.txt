The second season got commonly positive audits. "Bop Gun" was especially acclaimed; it was named one of the ten best scenes of the arrangement by "The Baltimore Sun", and the "Star Tribune" called Williams' execution one of the ten best visitor star crossroads in TV history. The execution of Andre Braugher was likewise especially adulated, particularly for his scene in "Beat up", in which Pembleton convinces a suspect to admit to a homicide he didn't submit. Gail Pennington of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" said the second season was an improvement over the main, which she said was astounding yet "would in general interest a dreadful part from watchers". Pennington said the conditioned down visual style and more grounded accentuation on single stories better engaged the show, including: ""Homicide" is extraordinary TV, and NBC puts stock in it enough to give it what might be the system's best vacancy." Bob Langford of "The News and Observer" called "Manslaughter" "completely splendid" and adulated it for concentrating not on the violations but rather on its impacts, just as the reasonable topics with respect to race, for example, worries in "Bop Gun" that the homicide would deflect white sightseers from visiting Baltimore. Langford said it was at times long winded, however stated, "Once in a while, a great lesson is the thing that we need. Astonishing that one this amazing can emerge out of a TV appear."
