MacLean affirmed that in his discourses with George Orsborne, he had shaped the feeling that the commander was part-proprietor of the vessel. Orsborne had referenced to him the likelihood of taking part in productive exercises, for example, weapon running and sneaking. John Moore, the overseeing executive of Marstrand's, expressed that he had expected Orsborne to take "Young lady Pat" angling in a territory of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was angling effectively. At the point when Moore was interviewed, the resistance's "not kidding charges" were uncovered. It was put to Moore that he had taught George Orsborne not to go angling, however to dispose of the vessel so the organization could guarantee its protection esteem, of which Orsborne would be remunerated with an offer. The protection claimed that the organization was fit as a fiddle, and that its boats were intensely sold. Moore denied that he had made any such recommendation to Orsborne. The organization, he demanded, was monetarily stable, the home loans on its vessels were generally low, and he had never examined protected qualities with Orsborne. The protection further claimed that when taken out "Young lady Pat" had been in an unseaworthy condition, insufficiently provisioned and unfit for an ordinary angling voyage. This recommendation was likewise denied by Moore.
