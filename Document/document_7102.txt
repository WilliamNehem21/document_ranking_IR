At the gathering of the Estates, Henry expressed gratitude toward Catherine for all she had done. He called her the mother of the ruler as well as the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his arrangement for an answer for his issues. On 23 December 1588, he solicited the Duke from Guise to approach him at the ChÃÂ¢teau de Blois. As Guise entered the ruler's chamber, the Forty-five dove their edges into his body, and he kicked the bucket at the foot of the lord's bed. At a similar minute, eight individuals from the Guise family were gathered together, including the Duke of Guise's sibling, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the following day in the royal residence prisons. Following the homicide of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's room on the floor underneath and reported, "It would be ideal if you pardon me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He won't be talked about once more. I have had him slaughtered. I have done to him what he would do to me." Catherine's quick response isn't known; however on Christmas Day, she told a minister, "Goodness, vomited man! What has he done?ÃÂ ... Petition God for himÃÂ ... I see him hurrying towards his ruin." She visited her old companion Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to disclose to him she was certain he would before long be liberated. He yelled at her, "Your words, Madam, have driven all of us to this butchery." She left in tears.
