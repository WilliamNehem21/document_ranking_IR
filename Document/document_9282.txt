From the time numismatists wound up mindful of 1804 dollars, they have instructed high costs, both in connection to their presumptive worth and the numismatic estimation of other silver dollars. Some early models were kept up in the Mint's coin bureau for use in exchanges, and in 1859, vendors started offering Class II dollars valued at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt supposedly offered a Philadelphia coin seller three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was allegedly bought in Vienna for $740, and a Class I example was unloaded for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, a model sold for $1,800, and a similar coin apparently sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar got $28,000 at a bartering directed by Stack's, a coin firm, and a similar coin came to $36,000 at another Stack's deal in 1963. A Class I example brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's sale, and amid a 1980 ascent in coin costs, a Class III model sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I model came to $990,000 at a Superior Galleries closeout in 1990, and a precedent once possessed by mint piece gatherer Louis Eliasberg turned into the initial 1804 dollar to outperform $1 million at sale, selling for $1,815,000 at a deal led by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.
