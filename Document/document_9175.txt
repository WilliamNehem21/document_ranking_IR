The SaigÃÂ family was one part of the recognized Kikuchi group of Kyushu that had moved northward to Mikawa Province in the fifteenthÃÂ century. In 1524, the powers of Matsudaira Kiyoyasu (1511Ã¢ÂÂ 1536), the granddad of Tokugawa Ieyasu, raged and took the SaigÃÂ tribe's central command at Yamanaka Castle amid his success of the Mikawa district. Not long after the fight, SaigÃÂ Nobusada, the third leader of the SaigÃÂ, submitted to the Matsudaira group. Following the inconvenient passing of Kiyoyasu in 1536, and the incapable administration and early demise of Matsudaira Hirotada (1526Ã¢ÂÂ 1549), the leaderless Matsudaira family at long last submitted to Imagawa Yoshimoto (1519Ã¢ÂÂ 1560) of Suruga Province, east of Mikawa. At the point when the Matsudaira tumbled to the Imagawa, the families of their retainers, which incorporated the SaigÃÂ, in like manner submitted to the Imagawa. Following the Battle of Okehazama (1560), SaigÃÂ Masakatsu endeavored to re-declare the autonomy of the tribe while yielding some land concessions to the Imagawa. Accordingly, Imagawa Ujizane captured thirteen SaigÃÂ men, and had them vertically skewered close Yoshida Castle. The executions did not deflect the SaigÃÂ, and in 1562 the Imagawa propelled corrective intrusions of east Mikawa and assaulted the two principle SaigÃÂ mansions. Masakatsu was slaughtered in the clash of Gohonmatsu Castle; his oldest child Motomasa was executed amid the fight for Wachigaya Castle. Group authority go to Masakatsu's child, SaigÃÂ Kiyokazu (1533Ã¢ÂÂ 1594), who promised his unwaveringness to the Matsudaira tribe, under the administration of Tokugawa Ieyasu, in their common battle against the Imagawa. In 1569, the intensity of the Imagawa finished with the Siege of Kakegawa Castle.
