Elworthy proposed that the Ooser was a delineation of the Devil, a thought bolstered by Dewar, who trusted that, as the Devil, its symbolism was "planned to rouse fear in the brains of the silly and the fiendish". On the other hand, others have recommended that it is a delineation of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book "The God of the Witches", Margaret Murray associated the Ooser to her adaptation of the witch-faction speculationÃ¢ÂÂthe possibility that those aggrieved in the Early Modern witch preliminaries were followers of an enduring pre-Christian ripeness religionÃ¢ÂÂguaranteeing that the cover was a clique thing that reflected proceeding with love of the religion's Horned God. Murray's theory is currently ruined. The antiquarians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have expressed that "today, researchers are concurred that Murray was something other than wrong [regarding the presence of the witch-cult] Ã¢ÂÂ she was totally and embarrassingly wrong on almost every last bit of her fundamental premises". The Ooser's pre-Christian beginning hypothesis was resounded in the "Peruser's Digest" reference book of British fables, "Old stories, Myths and Legends of Britain", where it was portrayed as "the icon of a previous divine force of richness". Despite the fact that not trusting that the Ooser was a particular portrayal of an enduring pre-Christian god, Dewar proposed that the symbolism of the Devil, and in this manner of the Ooser, was initially drawn from the pre-Christian divine forces of "phallic or fruitfulness adore".
