The golden-crowned sifaka lives in dry deciduous, gallery, and semi-evergreen forests and is found at altitudes up to , though it seems to prefer lower elevations. Surveys have shown it to be limited to highly fragmented forests surrounding the town of Daraina in an area encircled by the Loky and Manambato rivers in northeastern Madagascar. The golden-crowned sifaka has one of the smallest geographic ranges of all indriid lemur species. Out of 75Â forest fragments studied by researchers, its presence could be definitively reported in only 44, totaling . This study, published in 2002, also estimated the total species population and observed population densities. Home range size varied between per group. With an average group size of five individuals, the population density ranged between 17 and 28Â individuals per km. Another home range size estimate of has also been suggested with a population density range of 10 and 23Â individuals per km. The forested area available to the species within its desired elevation range was estimated at , yielding an estimated population of 6,120â10,080 and a breeding population between 2,520 and 3,960Â individuals. However, a study published in 2010 using line transect data from 2006 and 2008 in five major forest fragments yielded an estimated population of 18,000 individuals.
