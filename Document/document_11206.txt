"Oryzomys couesi" is a medium-sized to expansive rodent with coarse hide that is buff to rosy above, getting to be paler towards the sides and cheeks and darker on the posterior and face. The underparts are white to buff. The hide is shorter, more splendid, and more extreme in shading than in the swamp rice rodent. The nose closes gruffly and the reasonably huge eyes show ruddy eyeshine. The little ears are dark outwardly and within is secured with short, dim to buff or red hairs. The long tail is dim dark colored above and white to light darker underneath. The feet are long and strong. On the forefeet, the ungual (tufts of hair on the digits) are available. A considerable lot of the cushions on the hindfeet are decreased, similar to the ungual tufts, and little interdigital networks might be available in probably a few examples. A portion of these characteristics are regular adjustments to life in the water in oryzomyines. As in most different oryzomyines, females have eight mammae. Head and body length is , tail length is , hindfoot length is , ear length is , and weight is . Concentrates in Texas and El Salvador found that guys are somewhat bigger than females.
