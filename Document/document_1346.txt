The four mosaic blessed messengers in the pendentives, which improved its high adjusted dividers legitimately beneath the congregation's vault and filled in as the setting beds for a huge number of tesserae, were seriously harmed. Portions of the fallen mosaics were stolen, however later returned secretly. The heavenly attendants' harm caused extensive pieces of mortar and glass to tumble to the floor eighty feet underneath , while different areas "were left hanging by the sheer geometry of their curved shape". An eight-foot mosaic area of a holy messenger's left wing in the congregation's upper east corner tumbled to the floor. A few stones from the east curve divider fell onto seats in the gallery, and the organ-space railing fallen internal. In spite of the fact that the harm was minor, the congregation stayed shut until 1992 while rebuilding, just as a propping venture to shield the structure from future tremors, without changing the structure's enrichments, was completed. The college procured a group of contractual workers, basic designers, modelers, and preservation pros to build up a redesign plan, which was paid for by a $10 million raising money drive. Numerous gifts originated from students, and the college's leading group of trustees affirmed the arrangement before its financing was set up on the grounds that they perceived the congregation's significance to Stanford.
