"Temeraire" appropriately gotten requests to join the Cadiz bar, and having cruised to meet with Collingwood, Harvey anticipated Nelson's landing. Nelson's lead, the 100-weapon , touched base off Cadiz on 28 September, and he took over direction of the armada from Collingwood. He spent the following couple of weeks framing his arrangement of assault in anticipation of the normal fight of the Franco-Spanish armada, issuing it to his skippers on 9 October as a reminder. The reminder called for two divisions of boats to assault at right edges to the adversary line, disjoining its van from the inside and back. A third development squadron would be conveyed as a save, with the capacity to go along with one of the lines as the course of the fight directed. Nelson set the biggest and most dominant boats at the leaders of the lines, with "Temeraire" allocated to lead Nelson's very own section into fight. The armada watched an extensive separation from the Spanish coast to bait the joined armada out, and the boats accepted the open door to practice and get ready for the coming fight. For "Temeraire" this most likely included painting her sides in the Nelson Chequer configuration, to empower the British boats to tell companion from enemy in the perplexity of fight.
