Both LutosÃÂawski's symphonious and aleatory procedures are delineated by "precedent 1", a selection from "HÃÂ©sitant", the primary development of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a prompt to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who at that point play their parts time permitting, with no endeavor to synchronize with different instrumentalists. The amicability of this segment depends on a 12-note harmony worked from significant seconds and flawless fourths. After every one of the instrumentalists have completed their parts, a two-second broad respite is shown (P.G. 2" at upper right of the model). The conductor at that point gives a prompt at number 8 (and shows the beat of the accompanying area) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each have their influence, again with no endeavor to synchronize with different players. The amicability of this part depends on the hexachord FÃ¢ÂÂ GÃ¢ÂÂ AÃ¢ÂÂ CÃ¢ÂÂ DÃ¢ÂÂ D, orchestrated so that the agreement of the segment never incorporates any sixths or thirds. At the point when the conductor gives another prompt at number 9, the players each proceed until they achieve the recurrent sign, and after that stop: they are probably not going to end the area in the meantime. This "hold back" (from numbers 8 to 9) repeats all through the development, somewhat changed each time, however constantly played by twofold reed instruments which don't play somewhere else in the development: LutosÃÂawski accordingly likewise cautiously controls the symphonic palette.
