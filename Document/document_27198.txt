Meyers is not believed to have had much experience building bridges and set about construction in a unique manner. The timber framework was first assembled in a field next to the sawmill, with each new piece bolted into place after being cut. If a piece did not fit, more careful measurements were made and a new piece was cut and tested. The outlines of the sections for curved beams for the Burr arch were first marked with chalk on the wood, then the saw crew lifted and guided it by hand against the sawblade to cut the curve. After the framework was completed in the field, it was taken apart, loaded onto the same ox carts used to bring the logs to the mill, and taken to the bridge site. There the framework was reassembled on the bridge abutments. Bolts were used to hold all of the large pieces together, while cross-pieces and small braces were nailed in place.
The Cogan House Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980 and was listed on the 2009 National Bridge Inventory (NBI). According to the NBI, the covered bridge is long, with a roadway wide, and a maximum load of . According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is , the load is , and the clearance height is . The width is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic. As of 2011, the clearance height posted on the bridge itself has been reduced to , and the posted maximum load has been reduced to . According to Landis, the top of the Burr arch is nearly above the floor of the bridge.
