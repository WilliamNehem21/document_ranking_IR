The Admiralty's 1905 draft building plan called for four capital ships in the 1907â1908 Naval Programme, but the new Liberal government cut one of these ships in mid-1906 and postponed another to the 1908â1909 Naval Programme, pending the conclusion of the ongoing Hague Peace Convention. The failure of the Germans to agree to any sort of naval arms control caused the government to reinstate the third ship. The Admiralty took until 12 June 1907 to decide not to build one of them as a battlecruiser, in favour of a squadron of four homogeneous battleships. Three of these would be part of the "St Vincent" class, while the single battleship planned for the 1908â1909 Naval Programme was later authorised as .
The design of the "St Vincent" class was derived from the preceding , with more powerful guns and a slight increase in size and armour. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. In comparison to the "Bellerophon" class, the displacement of the "St Vincent"s was increased by , the length by and the beam by ; their crews numbered about 755 officers and ratings upon completion and 835 during the war.
