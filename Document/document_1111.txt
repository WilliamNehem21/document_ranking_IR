In 1910, the Austria-Hungary Naval Technical Committee started the structure and improvement of a beach front torpedo vessel, indicating that it ought to be fit for continuing for 10 hours. This determination was based a desire that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be barred by threatening powers amid a future clash. In such conditions, there would be a requirement for a torpedo watercraft that could cruise from the Austro-Hungarian Navy () base at the Bocche di Cattaro (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait amid the night, find and assault barricading boats and come back to port before morning. Steam turbine control was chosen for impetus, as diesels with the essential power were not accessible, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the functional experience to run turbo-electric vessels. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was chosen for the agreement to assemble the initial eight vessels, assigned the T-gathering. Another delicate was mentioned for four additional vessels, however when Ganz and Danubius marked down their cost by 10%, a sum of sixteen water crafts were requested from them, assigned the F-gathering. The F-bunch assignment connoted the area of Ganz and Danubius' fundamental shipyard at Fiume. "96 F" was the fifteenth vessel of the F-gathering to be finished.
