Following CortÃÂ©s' visit, no Spanish endeavored to visit the warlike Itza occupants of NojpetÃÂ©n for just about a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan monks set out from MÃÂ©rida in YucatÃÂ¡n set for endeavor the serene change of the still agnostic Itza in focal PetÃÂ©n. BartolomÃÂ© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were joined by some Christianised Maya. AndrÃÂ©s Carrillo de PernÃÂ­a, a "Criollo" who was the "alcalde" of Bacalar (a pioneer official), joined the gathering at Bacalar and escorted them upriver to the extent Tipuj, coming back to Bacalar once he was sure of the monks accepting a decent welcome there. Following a difficult half year venture the explorers were generally welcomed by the current Kan EkÃÂ¼. They remained at NojpetÃÂ©n for some days trying to proselytize the Itza, however the Aj Kan EkÃÂ¼ would not disavow his Maya religion, in spite of the fact that he demonstrated enthusiasm for the majority held by the Catholic teachers. Kan EkÃÂ¼ educated them that as indicated by antiquated Itza prescience it was not yet time for them to change over. In the time since CortÃÂ©s had visited NojpetÃÂ©n, the Itza had made a statue of the revered pony. Juan de Orbita was shocked when he saw the icon and he quickly crushed it into pieces. Fuensalida had the capacity to spare the lives of the guests from the chafed locals by methods for an especially articulate lesson that brought about them being excused. Endeavors to change over the Itza fizzled, and the ministers left NojpetÃÂ©n on well disposed terms with Kan EkÃÂ¼.
