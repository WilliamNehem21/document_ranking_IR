The CoE erroneously trusted that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover the zone of the huge inns, so those bundles were added to the land they bought for the venture. Dallas Barrack, who claimed Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been dealt with ineffectively and had gotten significantly less than his property was value. The CoE held a fixed offer sale and J. G. Cheers obtained what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He wanted to move the leftovers of Oklahoma Row out of the way of the rising lake waters. So as to do this, it was first important to expel the log part or shell of the inn. The first windows and entryways were disassembled for the move and later reinstalled. The chimneys, just as the majority of the significant stonework were later torn down. Likewise sold at closeout were two huge solid seats that had been at the base of the amphitheater. They were purchased by Mr. what's more, Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were utilized to adorn the yards of their Town and Country eatery and motel. The seats are as yet situated in Rogers; be that as it may, they currently sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park with no plaque or marker showing their centrality. The solid lounge chair was left set up at the base of the amphitheater, in light of the fact that nobody needed to endeavor to move it.
