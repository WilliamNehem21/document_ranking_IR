Following seven days of reports primarily worried about survival records and tributes, on October 18 "The New York Times" swung to "Exercises Concerning Means of Security on Ocean Steamers". Among a few suggestions were: the obligatory utilization of steam whistles or trumpets as mist flags; the development of lasting watertight bulkheads in all traveler conveying ships; sorted out raft drills for travelers; better control and all the more preparing among sailors. Maybe a couple of these recommended changes were embraced quickly; calls for steamships cruising under the U.S. banner to convey adequate rafts for everybody on board were opposed until after the loss of 58 years after the fact. In December 1854 "The New York Times" required an official enquiry into the fiasco: "Whatever might be the degree of their legitimate obligation, the proprietors, the officers and the team of the "Ice" are capable to the open judgmentÃÂ ... They reserve no privilege to oppose any endeavor that might be made to characterize the degree of that obligation, nor to expostulate any level of investigation into their lead". No such examination was ever established, and nobody was prosecuted for their activities. A portion of the crew members who arrived in Quebec evaded inquiries by not coming back to the United States; as indicated by Shaw they "vanished on the waterfronts along the St Lawrence River and found the lack of definition they needed".
