Other than the verifiable issues that the jury was approached to mediate, there was a lawful issue of what comprised "temptation" under the law. The premise of the case was a two-hundred-year-old tort which enabled a man to sue anyone who impregnated his female worker. The reason for harms under such a case was the worker's failure to play out her obligations to the inconvenience of the business. The tort was later expanded to enable the seductee's dad to sue; just in resolution in 1903 was the law corrected to offer remaining to the lady herself. At issue was what harm, assuming any, she expected to appear so as to have a reason for activity. The resistance contended that in all points of reference there had been a pregnancy coming about, and that without one the offended parties couldn't guarantee harms. Accordingly, MacLean underscored the not so much consensual nature of the supposed relationship. Brownlee himself reacted that if the supposed relationship had been non-consensual, he ought to have been charged under the criminal law for assault, not sued for temptation; that the offended parties had not endeavored to squeeze criminal allegations was proof, he accepted, of their dishonesty and monetary inspiration.
