In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet worked by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and crashed into a van traveling eastbound on the A40 Western Avenue; the flying machine was conveying a performing artist destined for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the on-screen character and van driver all endured minor wounds. The following examination by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the group's absence of getting English and military airport regulation strategies had contributed essentially to the accident. In this manner, after nearly thirty years of extended thought, an ILS was in the end fitted to Northolt's re-imagined Runway 25. Furthermore, total filled security pits were introduced at each finish of the runway by 21 January 1998 to ensure street clients in case of another business stream or military transport neglecting to stop or climb before the finish of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the transformation of RAF Northolt to a conceivable branch of Heathrow Airport during the 1990s. While the current runways would make flying machine cross the flight ways of those utilizing Heathrow, new parallel runways were proposed. These recommendations were contradicted by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and in the long run advanced no further.
