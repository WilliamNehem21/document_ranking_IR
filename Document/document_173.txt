Attebery credited Le Guin, among others, of restoring age deliver stories during the 1990s, yet composed that their creators moved the accentuation of such stories from people towards investigating shared activity and conviction. Le Guin wished to concentrate on the "center ages" in such stories; those ages that experienced their voyage in disconnection. As indicated by Attebery, Le Guin had the capacity to investigate these lives since writers before her had composed of the start and completion of age deliver ventures. An audit of "The Found and the Lost" in the online sci-fi magazine "Tor.com" thought about "Heavens Lost" and "Vaster than Empires and More Slow", expressing that while the two stories analyzed the difficulties of interstellar travel and the disengagement it expedited, the contrasts between them were "as obvious as they are entrancing". It proceeded to state that "Heavens Lost" investigated the issue of seclusion in space travel with "sympathy and persistence", and considered the story the "summit of the gathering, [which drew] together the network building and existential disquietude of all the past stories into a spellbinding and conflicted end". Talking about the volume all in all, "Tor.com" expressed that it perusers home to places they've never visited, and making the commonplace more bizarre more unusual still".
