On MayÃÂ 14, 1810, the British war clipper HMS "Mistletoe" landed at Buenos Aires with European papers that announced the disintegration of the Supreme Central Junta the past January. The city of Seville had been attacked by French armed forces, which were at that point ruling the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula. The papers announced that a portion of the previous individuals from the Junta had taken asylum on the Isla de LeÃÂ³n in Cadiz. This was affirmed in Buenos Aires on MayÃÂ 17, when the British frigate HMS "John Paris" touched base in Montevideo; the latest papers announced that individuals from the Supreme Central Junta had been expelled. The Council of Regency of Cadiz was not seen as a successor of the Spanish opposition however as an endeavor to reestablish absolutism in Spain. The Supreme Central Junta was viewed as thoughtful to the new thoughts. South American nationalists dreaded both a total French triumph in the landmass and an absolutist reclamation. Cisneros checked the British warships and caught their papers, to hide the news, however a paper came under the control of Belgrano and Castelli. They spread the news among different loyalists and tested the authenticity of the Viceroy, who had been delegated by the fallen junta. At the point when Cornelio Saavedra, leader of the regiment of Patricians, was educated of this news, he concluded that it was at long last the perfect time to make a move against Cisneros. MartÃÂ­n RodrÃÂ­guez proposed to oust the Viceroy by power, yet Castelli and Saavedra rejected this thought and proposed the assembling of an open cabildo.
