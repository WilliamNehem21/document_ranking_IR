Correspondents and artists on the "Diary" regularly worked in sets. Davenport was collaborated with Lewis and the two before long manufactured a strong relationship. In mid 1896, Lewis went to Ohio to explore the main possibility for the Republican presidential selection, that state's previous representative, William McKinley. To meet the hopeful, Lewis was required to experience a meeting himself, with McKinley's political administrator, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Hanna had put aside his business vocation to deal with McKinley's crusade, and was paying all costs for a political machine which helped make McKinley the leader in the Republican race. Lewis got his meeting with McKinley, at that point stayed in Ohio, examining Hanna. In 1893, Governor McKinley had been called upon to pay the commitments of a companion for whom he had co-marked advances; Hanna and other McKinley supporters had purchased up or paid these obligations. Lewis saw Hanna as controlling McKinley, ready to destroy the competitor by bringing in the obtained notes. Ending up progressively offended by what he esteemed as Hanna's buy of the Republican designation, thus likely the administration, Lewis started to promote this view in the pages of the "Diary". The primary Davenport animation portraying Hanna showed up before long.
