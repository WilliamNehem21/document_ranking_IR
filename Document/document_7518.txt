Jack and Helen were started into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons received the Thelemic aphorism of "Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae", a Latin mistranslation of "The foundation of Thelema through the customs of affection". The initials of this maxim illuminated T.O.P.A.N., additionally filling in as the statement "To Pan". Remarking on Parsons' mistakes of interpretation, jokingly Crowley said that "the aphorism which you notice is framed in a language past my forces of comprehension". Parsons additionally embraced the Thelemic title "Frater T.O.P.A.N"Ã¢ÂÂ with "T.O.P.A.N" spoke to in Kabbalistic numerology as "210"the name with which he every now and again marked letters to mysterious partnersÃ¢ÂÂwhile Helen ended up known as "Soror Grimaud". Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was "an extremely superb manÃÂ ... He has an amazing personality and much preferable astuteness over myselfÃÂ ... JP will be truly significant". Wolfe kept in touch with German O.T.O. delegate Karl Germer that Parsons was "an A1 manÃÂ ... Crowleyesque in accomplishment truly", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley agreed with such evaluations, educating Smith that Parsons "is the most esteemed individual from the entire Order, with no special case!"
