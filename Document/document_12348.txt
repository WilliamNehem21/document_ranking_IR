Two more battle forms of the PanzerÃÂ I were planned and delivered somewhere in the range of 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the structure idea had been supplanted by medium and overwhelming tanks and neither one of the variants was created in adequate numbers to really affect the advancement of the war. These new tanks shared nothing for all intents and purpose with either the Ausf.ÃÂ A or B aside from name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.ÃÂ C, was structured together between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to give a sufficiently shielded and outfitted observation light tank. The Ausf.ÃÂ C flaunted a totally new skeleton and turret, a cutting edge torsion-bar suspension and five "Schachtellaufwerk"- style interleaved roadwheels. It likewise had a most extreme reinforcement thickness of 30ÃÂ millimeters (1.18ÃÂ in), over twice that of either the Ausf.ÃÂ A or B, and was furnished with a Mauser EW 141 self-loader hostile to tank rifle, with a 50-round drum, discharging ground-breaking covering puncturing 7.92x94mm Patrone 318 enemy of tank rounds. Forty of these tanks were created, alongside six models. Two tanks were conveyed to first Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were sent to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps amid the Normandy arrivals.
