Campbell's arrangements for "Obscure" were spread out in the February 1939 issue of "Bewildering", in the declaration of the new magazine. He contended that "it has been the nature of the dream that you have perused in the past that has made the very word utter horror ... ["Unknown"] will offer dream of a quality so far not the same as that which has showed up in the past as to change your whole comprehension of the term". The primary issue, the next month, drove with Russell's "Evil Barrier", the novel that had influenced Campbell to set his arrangements for a dream magazine into movement: the plot, including outsiders who possess mankind, has been depicted by sf student of history Mike Ashley as "a bizarre blend of sci-fi and mysterious dream". Campbell approached Russell for corrections to the story to underscore the awesome components, yet at the same time requested that Russell work out the legitimate ramifications of his premises. This turned into a characterizing normal for the fiction distributed in "Obscure"; in Ashley's words, Campbell "conveyed the sci-fi justification to dream". The primary issue additionally contained Horace L. Gold's "Issue with Water", a comic dream about a cutting edge New Yorker who insults a water little person; in its whimsicality and naturalistic converging of an advanced foundation with an exemplary dream figure of speech, "Issue with Water" was a superior sign than "Vile Barrier" of the course "Obscure" would take. Campbell remarked in a letter at the time that "Vile Barrier", "Issue with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the main stories in the principal issue that precisely mirrored his objectives for the magazine.
