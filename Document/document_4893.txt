The crusade was for the most part directed by a gathering of Whig congressmen in Washington, including Clay, who pooled their mailing records; there were associations in every district entrusted with running the neighborhood battle and getting out the vote. Much work was additionally done by the new political managers, as Thurlow Weed of New York, who likewise assumed responsibility for a significant part of the raising money. Greeley, by then proofreader of the generally circled Harrison crusade diary, "The Log Cabin", stressed that the steady requests for cash would drive the well off from legislative issues; this did not happen. A great part of the cash originated from those, for example, land examiners, who might profit by the interior enhancements to transportation that were upheld by the Whigs. Subsidizing for neighborhood tasks was relied upon to be raised locally, some of the time through game plans like kickbacks from Pennsylvania trench temporary workers, something actualized by Thaddeus Stevens. Erie Canal laborers were relied upon to pay a toll to Weed to back Whig tasks. Feeling that each hand was expected to crush Van Buren, Whig pioneers enabled ladies to help: in spite of the fact that they couldn't cast a ballot, they could impact men. This was the first occasion when that an American ideological group included ladies in battle exercises on an across the board scale.
