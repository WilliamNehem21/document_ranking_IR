Unmistakable highlights of "Ramaria botrytis" incorporate its substantial size, the orange, rosy, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with measurements averaging 13.8 by 4.7ÃÂ ÃÂµm, and a frail amyloid recoloring response of the stem tissue. "R.ÃÂ rubripermanens" has rosy terminal branches, a strong structure, and striate spores, however might be recognized from "R.ÃÂ botrytis" by its a lot shorter spores. Different species with which "R.ÃÂ botrytis" might be confounded include: "R.ÃÂ formosa", which has branches that are pinker than "R.ÃÂ botrytis", and yellow-tipped; "R.ÃÂ caulifloriformis", found in the Great Lakes district of the United States, whose branch tips obscure with age; "R.ÃÂ strasseri", which has yellow to dark colored branch tips; "R.ÃÂ rubrievanescens", which has branches in which the pink shading blurs subsequent to picking or in develop natural product bodies; and "R.ÃÂ botrytoides", which is most dependably recognized from "R.ÃÂ botrytis" by its smooth spores. The European species "R.ÃÂ rielii", regularly mistook for "R.ÃÂ botrytis" and in some cases thought about synonymous, can be recognized by infinitesimal qualities: "R.ÃÂ reilii" comes up short on the clasped hyphae of "R.ÃÂ botrytis", its spores are longer and more extensive, and they have moles rather than striations. The North American species "R.ÃÂ araiospora", however externally like "R.ÃÂ botrytis", has a few distinctive attributes: it develops under hemlock; it has rosy to maroon branches with orange to yellowish tips; it comes up short on any noticeable smell; it has warted, fairly tube shaped spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7ÃÂ ÃÂµm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Consistently hued brilliant pink to ruddy, "R.ÃÂ subbotrytis" has spores estimating 7Ã¢ÂÂ 9 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ 3.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm.
