Notwithstanding his powerless military circumstance, Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t tried to upset the arranging of a false submission that DiÃ¡Â»Âm had booked to dismiss BÃ¡ÂºÂ£o ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i as head of state. Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t appropriated a handout denouncing DiÃ¡Â»Âm as an American manikin, declaring that the PM was going to "Catholicize" the nation; the choice was mostly supported by the U.S. government and different Roman Catholic associations. DiÃ¡Â»Âm had solid help from American Roman Catholic government officials and the incredible Cardinal Francis Spellman and his senior sibling, Pierre Martin NgÃÂ´ ÃÂÃÂ¬nh ThÃ¡Â»Â¥c, was Archbishop of HuÃ¡ÂºÂ¿. Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t perceptively noticed that the submission was a methods ""for Diem to assemble the general population from all towns and power them to show one objective: to oust Bao Dai and declare the manikin Diem as the head of-province of Vietnam."" upon the arrival of the survey, Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t's men forestalled casting a ballot in the outskirt districts which they controlled, and wandered out of the wildernesses to assault surveying stations in CÃ¡ÂºÂ§n ThÃÂ¡. Notwithstanding that disturbance, DiÃ¡Â»Âm was falsely credited with over 90% of help in HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o-controlled region, and a close consistent turnout was recorded in the region. These outcomes were repeated the country over, and DiÃ¡Â»Âm ousted BÃ¡ÂºÂ£o ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i.
