In September 1922, Filkins again unearthed at Coldrum, this time with the guide of Gravesend inhabitant Charles Gilbert. Their undertaking was financed through gifts given by the British Association and the Society of Antiquaries, with Filkins noticing that at the season of its initiation, "a smaller than normal wilderness" had grown up around the site which must be cleared. Removal proceeded sporadically until no less than 1926. Human remains were found, and put into the ownership of Sir Arthur Keith of the Royal College of Surgeons, despite the fact that it is additionally recorded that sooner or later somewhere in the range of 1939 and 1945 human remains that had been found at the site were reburied in the churchyard at Trottiscliffe. This unearthing uncovered all the current sarsens encompassing the landmark, a few which had recently been covered. The stones of the chamber were shored up with solid establishments where Filkins regarded it fundamental. Despite the fact that Filkins' removal was far reaching, it ignored stone gaps, pressing stones, and their relationship to the hill. In 1998, Ashbee noticed that while from "a present-day viewpoint, it is conceivable to see weaknesses [in Filkins' excavation...] as far as the general models of the early piece of this century, there is a lot to praise."
