Only one out of every odd observer concurred with Colquhoun's gauge, which turned into "the most generally cited whole", however in the supposition of Cindy McCreery the way that the vast majority concurred there were dreadfully numerous whores in London is demonstrative of across the board worry about the exchange. Frames of mind towards prostitution solidified toward the finish of the eighteenth century, with many survey whores as revolting and shameless, and it was in this environment that "Harris' List" met its death. Books, for example, the "Meandering Whore" and Edmund Curll's "Venus in the Cloyster" (1728) are frequently referenced close by "Harris's" as instances of suggestive writing. Alongside the namelessly expressed "Fifteen Plagues of a Maidenhead" (1707), Garfield and Curll's works were associated with cases that helped structure the eighteenth century lawful idea of "vulgar defamation"Ã¢ÂÂ which was a checked change from the past accentuation on controlling rebellion, sacrilege and sin, generally the ministerial courts' territory. No laws existed to preclude the production of sex entertainment; along these lines, when Curll was captured and detained in 1725 (the primary such arraignment in almost 20ÃÂ years), it was under danger of a criticism charge. He was discharged a couple of months after the fact, just to be bolted up again to distribute different materials esteemed hostile by the experts. Curll's involvement with the blue pencils was exceptional, however, and arraignments dependent on disgusting productions remained an irregularity. In spite of the fact that their court activity spelled the end for "Harris' List", regardless of the best endeavors of the Proclamation Society (later the Society for the Suppression of Vice), the distribution of sex entertainment proceeded apace; increasingly obscene material was distributed amid the Victorian time than whenever beforehand.
