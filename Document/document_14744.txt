Napoleon's militaries involved WÃÂ¼rttemberg from 1800Ã¢ÂÂ 01, driving the duke and duchess to escape to Vienna. The royals returned when Frederick II concurred in 1803 to promise faithfulness to Napoleon and part with WÃÂ¼rttemberg's region on the Left Bank, a region of . In return, agreeing Treaty of LunÃÂ©ville, Frederick II was named an Elector-ruler and given of Right Bank an area. Frederick II, presently Elector Frederick I, presently entrusted his court modeler Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret with revamping the royal residence in the Neoclassical style. Thouret began in the Ahengalerie and the Ordensbau, working there from 1803 to 1806. For two days in October 1805, Napoleon visited Ludwigsburg to constrain Frederick I into joining the Confederation of the Rhine and along these lines turning into his partner, remunerating WÃÂ¼rttemberg with neighboring domains in the Holy Roman Empire and Frederick I with the title of King. Frederick I again entrusted Thouret with a redesigning, from 1808 to 1811, of the Ordenskapelle and the ruler's loft. The last modernizations requested by the ruler occurred from 1812 to 1816 in the Schlosstheater and Marble Hall. Amid this time, the roof frescoes of the Guard Room and the fundamental staircases of the Neuer Hauptbau were repainted. When Frederick I passed on in 1816, most of the royal residence had been changed over to mirror the most recent style.
