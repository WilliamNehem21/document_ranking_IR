In addition to her live performances of "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" in awards ceremonies and televised shows, the song was included on the set list for her tours The BeyoncÃ© Experience and I Am... World Tour. John Aizlewood of "Daily Mail" described the performance of the song during The BeyoncÃ© Experience as "head-spinning". During BeyoncÃ©'s performance of "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" at a concert in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think BeyoncÃ© would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Ann Powers of "Los Angeles Times" discussed about the malfunction, saying: "As a pop queen, BeyoncÃ© is almost too perfect... [a] 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." During the I Am... World Tour, BeyoncÃ© did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" after her entrance on stage. During the revue I Am... Yours which was a part of the tour, BeyoncÃ© performed a jazz medley of "DÃ©jÃ  Vu", "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" and "Bootylicious" and continued with a full version of the first song. Concert performances of "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" were included on her live albums "The BeyoncÃ© Experience Live" (2007), "" (2009) and "I Am... World Tour" (2010).
BeyoncÃ© performed DÃ©jÃ  Vu during her 2018 Coachella Performances on April 14 and April 21, 2018 with a guest appearance by Jay Z, along with a live orchrestra. It had been more than 8 years since she last performed the song.
