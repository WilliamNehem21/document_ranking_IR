Foss is named by English Heritage as the foremost supporter for "Redemore" as the fight site. He recommends the name is gotten from ""Hreod Mor"", an Anglo-Saxon expression that signifies "reedy marshland". Putting together his conclusion with respect to thirteenth and sixteenth century church records, he trusts "Redemore" was a region of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the town of Dadlington, and was near the Fenn Lanes, a Roman street running east to west over the locale. Foard trusts this street to be the most plausible course that the two armed forces took to achieve the war zone. Williams rejects the idea of "Redmore" as a particular area, saying that the term alludes to a vast zone of ruddy soil; Foss contends that Williams' sources are neighborhood stories and defective understandings of records. In addition, he suggests that Williams was affected by William Hutton's 1788 "The Battle of Bosworth-Field", which Foss faults for presenting the thought that the fight was battled west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the River Sence. Hutton, as Foss recommends, misconstrued an entry from his source, Raphael Holinshed's 1577 "Narrative". Holinshed expressed, "Lord Richard pitched his field on a slope called Anne Beame, revived his troopers and took his rest." Foss trusts that Hutton mixed up "field" to signify "field of fight", in this manner making that the battle occurred on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To "[pitch] his field", as Foss clears up, was a period articulation for setting up a camp.
