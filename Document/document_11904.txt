The star framework is the model of a gathering of overshadowing parallel stars named Algol factors, however it has a third part to make up what is really a triple star framework. The most brilliant part is a blue-white fundamental grouping star of ghostly kind B8V, which is 3.5 occasions as monstrous and multiple times as radiant as the Sun. The optional segment is an orange subgiant star of sort K0IV that has started cooling and growing to 3.5 occasions the range of the Sun, and has 4.5 occasions the glow and 80% of its mass. These two are isolated by just 0.05 galactic units (AU)Ã¢ÂÂ five percent of the separation between the Earth and Sun; the principle plunge in brilliance emerges when the bigger fainter partner goes before the more sweltering more brilliant essential. The tertiary part is a principle succession star of sort A7, which is situated all things considered 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose essential part is a B-type fundamental grouping star with an obvious size of 6.69. Phi Persei is a twofold star, in spite of the fact that the two segments don't overshadow one another. The essential star is a Be star of otherworldly sort B0.5, conceivably a goliath star, and the optional friend is likely an outstanding leftover. The auxiliary has a comparable ghostly sort to O-type subdwarfs.
