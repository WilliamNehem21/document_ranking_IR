Activity Uranus caught somewhere in the range of 250,000 and 300,000 Axis troopers inside a territory extending from east to west and north to south. The pocket contained four infantry corps, a panzer corps having a place with the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and enduring components of two Romanian divisions, a Croat infantry regiment and other master units. Caught gear included around 100 tanks, 2,000 big guns pieces and mortars and 10,000 trucks.

Scaffolds traversing the Don River were stuck with traffic, as enduring Axis troopers quickly advanced eastwards in the driving rain climate, endeavoring to escape Soviet covering and infantry taking steps to cut them off from Stalingrad. Many injured Axis work force were trampled, and a large number of the individuals who endeavored to cross the stream by walking on the ice fell through and suffocated.

The last stragglers crossed the Don River by 24 November, and crushed the extensions to close the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies from the Soviets in Stalingrad.
