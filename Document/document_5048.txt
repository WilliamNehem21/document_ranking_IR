All through his vocation Monteux experienced being thought of as an authority in French music. The music that implied most to him was that of German arrangers, especially Brahms, yet this was regularly neglected by show advertisers and recording organizations. Of the four Brahms ensembles, he was welcomed by the chronicle organizations to record just one, the Second. Accounts of his live exhibitions of the First and Third have been discharged on CD, however the discography in Canarina's life story records no chronicle, live or from the studio, of the Fourth. The pundit William Mann, alongside numerous others, viewed him as a "remarkably legitimate" conductor of Brahms, however Cardus dissented: "In German music Monteux, normally enough, missed symphonious weight and the privilege intensely jumped rhythm. His mood, for instance, was excessively pointed for, state, Brahms or Schumann." "Gramophone"s commentator Jonathan Swain fights that no conductor knew more than Monteux about expressive conceivable outcomes in the strings, asserting that "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument essentially doesn't have the foggiest idea how to get the distinctive sounds; and the bow has such significance in string playing that there are possibly 50 diverse methods for creating a similar note"; In his 2003 memoir, John Canarina records nineteen "noteworthy world debuts" led by Monteux. Notwithstanding "Petrushka" and "The Rite of Spring" is a further Stravinsky work, "The Nightingale". Monteux's different debuts for Diaghilev incorporated Ravel's "Daphnis et ChloÃÂ©" and Debussy's "Jeux". In the show lobby he debuted works by, among others, Milhaud, Poulenc and Prokofiev. In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky stated "everybody can value your energy and your honesty as to the contemporary works of different inclinations that you have had event to protect."
