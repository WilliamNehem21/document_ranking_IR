Virginia Tech got the diversion's opening kickoff in their end zone for a touchback, and the Tech offense started at its 20-yard line. On the amusement's first play, Tech submitted a five-yard false begin punishment. Running back Shyrone Stith was ceased for a misfortune on the first non-punishment play of the amusement, yet Tech made up both that misfortune and the punishment when quarterback Michael Vick mixed for 25ÃÂ yards and a first down. Vick then kept running for another nine yards, pushing the line of scrimmage close midfield. Tech executed an alternative raced to Stith, who kept running inside the Florida State 30-yard line. Tech got a couple of yards with a keep running up the center, at that point Vick finished a go to Davis, giving the Hokies a first down at the Florida State 13-yard line. Stith grabbed seven yards on a race to the six-yard line, yet the Seminole protection solidified, and Tech was unfit to get the staying three yards required for a first down. Confronting a fourth down and requiring not exactly a yard to get another first down inside the Florida State three-yard line, Tech head mentor Frank Beamer kept his offense on the field to endeavor to pick up the first down instead of kick a field objective. On the endeavor, notwithstanding, Vick bobbled the ball forward into the end zone, where Florida State recouped it for a touchback. Virginia Tech was in this way precluded the principal score from securing the diversion, and Florida State's offense entered the amusement out of the blue.
