The eighth Battalion was brought up in Bristol in September 1914. It landed in France in July 1915 as a feature of the 57th Brigade in the nineteenth (Western) Division and saw its first activity the following year amid the Battle of Albert, in which it helped catch La Boisselle. The division's 58th Brigade had caught the western portion of the town on 2ÃÂ July, and the eighth Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment and tenth Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, both of the 57th Brigade, aided the catch of the remainder of the town the following day. A German counter-assault recaptured the eastern portion of the town, and the eighth Glosters endured 302 losses when it battled close by the tenth Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment to help retake it. Amid the fight, the Glosters' boss, Lieutenant-Colonel Adrian Carton de Wiart, expected direction of every one of the four 57th Brigade units when the other three leaders moved toward becoming setbacks, and for his activities in deflecting a genuine turn around he was granted the VC. Later that month, amid the Battle of PoziÃÂ¨res, the contingent made two ineffective assaults against the German line east of the town which together cost it 374 setbacks, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major Lord A.G. Thynne, both injured. On 18ÃÂ November, the most recent day of the Somme hostile, the force endured 295 losses when it caught Grandcourt amid the Battle of the Ancre.
