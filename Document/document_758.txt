Holst made couple of vast scale works in his last years. "A Choral Fantasia" of 1930 was composed for the Three Choirs Festival at Gloucester; starting and consummation with a soprano soloist, the work, likewise including melody, strings, metal and percussion, incorporates a considerable organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, "knows something of the 'huge and secretive's depression of "Egdon Heath"". Aside from his last uncompleted ensemble, Holst's residual works were for little powers; the eight "Groups" of 1932 were committed to his understudies, however in Imogen's view that they present a considerable test to the most expert of artists. The "Rivulet Green Suite" (1932), composed for the symphony of St Paul's School, was a late friend piece to the "St Paul's Suite". The "Verse Movement" for viola and little symphony (1933) was composed for Lionel Tertis. Calm and pondering, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was moderate to pick up prominence among violists. Robin Hull, in "Penguin Music Magazine", commended the work's "unmistakable excellenceÃ¢ÂÂdifficult to confuse with the specialty of some other arranger"; in Dickinson's view, be that as it may, it remains "a slight creation". Holst's last organization, the instrumental scherzo development of an anticipated ensemble, contains highlights normal for quite a bit of Holst's before musicÃ¢ÂÂ"a summing up of Holst's symphonic craftsmanship", as per Short. Dickinson recommends that the to some degree easygoing accumulation of material in the work gives little sign of the orchestra that may have been composed.
