Isabella, Mortimer and the rulers touched base in London on 4 January 1327. Because of the earlier year's spate of killings, Londoners had been illegal to remain battle ready, and after two days all residents had making a solemn vow to keep the harmony. Parliament met on 7 January to consider the condition of the domain now the King was imprisoned. It had initially been called by Isabella and the Prince, for the sake of the King, on 28 October the earlier year. Parliament had been planned to collect on 14 December 1326, yet on 3 DecemberÃ¢ÂÂstill for the sake of the KingÃ¢ÂÂfurther writs were issued conceding the sitting until early the following year. This, it was suggested, was because of the King being abroad, instead of detained. Along these lines, parliament would need to be held before the Queen and Prince Edward. "The History of Parliament Trust" has portrayed the lawfulness of the writs as being "very faulty", and C. T. Wood called the sitting "a show of pseudo-parliamentary normality", "arrange oversaw" by Mortimer and Thomas, Lord Wake. For Isabella and Mortimer, overseeing through parliament was just a transitory answer for an established issue, on the grounds that sooner or later their positions would probably be tested legitimately. Subsequently, proposes Ormrod, they needed to uphold an answer great to Mortimer and the Queen, using any and all means they could.
