On 25 April, the UstaÃÂ¡e captured a Serb named Milan RadovanoviÃÂ when he halted by the Bjelovar police headquarters to hand over his rifle. He had battled with the VKJ at the season of the intrusion and went through about fourteen days stowing away in the woodlands before coming back to his home in Prgomelje. His generally late return kept him from giving over his rifle before the UstaÃÂ¡e due date on 24 April. On the morning of 26 April, as RadovanoviÃÂ and another Serb detainee were being escorted from the province correctional facility by two UstaÃÂ¡e watches, two unidentified shooters opened flame on the prisoners and watchmen. A clash resulted, and RadovanoviÃÂ and one of the gatekeepers were slaughtered. The second gatekeeper was injured. That evening, a Croatian Home Guard (or "domobran") was slaughtered by a stray projectile in his yard while on leave. Kvaternik quickly accused the passings for "Serb fomenters". In their interior reports, the UstaÃÂ¡e ascribed the passings to "neighborhood Chetniks", a case that has never been demonstrated. A few history specialists have theorized that the assault on the district prison and the passing of the Home Guard were false banner assaults proposed to rally Croats against neighborhood Serbs. This claim has likewise never been demonstrated.
