Joseph expanded her showing responsibilities by regularly delegating for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She likewise proceeded in her job of the author's amanuensis, and was welcome to go to the private debut of "The Planets", on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult directed the Queen's Hall ensemble. She later expressed: "From the snapshot of MarsÃÂ ... to the last solid of Neptune, it was a major thing that will last for our entire lives, I think". She had the capacity to draw on her established training at Girton when she deciphered the spurious work "The Acts of John" from the first Greek, to give the content to Holst's "Song of Jesus" (1917); for a similar work she arranged a vocal score and a course of action for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst joined to create a ladies' voices rendition (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's "Mass for Three Voices", and Joseph worked alone to deliver an instrumental backup for Samuel Wesley's "Sing Aloud with Gladness". This last work was set up for the 1917 Whitsun melodic celebration, one of a yearly arrangement of such celebrations that Holst planned, first at the place where he grew up of Thaxted, in later years at grouped settings including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph turned into a key figure in these celebrations, as coordinator, entertainer and arranger. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her structures were performed: "Song" for female voices (presently lost), and a symphonic piece, "Barbara Noel's Morris", which Joseph wrote to stamp her fellowship with the little girl of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.
