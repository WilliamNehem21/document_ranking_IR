In a meeting with "The A.V. Club", Ward said the show's composition procedure more often than not started with the essayists disclosing to one another what they had done the earlier week to discover something clever to expand on. He likewise stated, "A ton of the time, in case we're truly stuck, we'll begin saying everything that rings a bell, which is typically the most exceedingly bad stuff, and after that another person will imagine that is horrible however it'll give him a superior thought and the ball just begins moving that way". On account of the bustling calendar of composing and organizing a TV arrangement, the journalists did not have sufficient energy to play "Cells and Dragons", yet despite everything they composed stories they would "need to play D&D with". Here and there, the journalists and storyboard craftsmen met and played composition recreations. One amusement that was frequently utilized is called choice carcass; one essayist begins a story on a sheet of paper, and another author attempts to complete it. Be that as it may, while a couple of scenes, (for example, the fifth-season scene "Puhoy" and the 6th season scene "Jake the Brick") have been created utilizing this amusement, Ward has admitted that "the thoughts are generally awful". Previous storyboard craftsman and imaginative executive Cole Sanchez said scene contents are either made by growing the smart thoughts delivered by these composition amusements, or depend on a thought proposed by a storyboard craftsman in the expectation it tends to be formed into a scene.
