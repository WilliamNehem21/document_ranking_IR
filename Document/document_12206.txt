Shapiro reacts to Goodin's contention by testing his verifiable supposition that people would starve on the off chance that they denied the workfare throffer. In state-supported (see welfare state) workfare frameworks, he guarantees, just money related help is wiped out by a refusal to acknowledge the throffer, while in private frameworks (that is, non-state philanthropies or associations offering contingent guide), different gatherings than the one working a workfare framework exist. In either framework, beneficiaries of welfare may likewise swing to family and companions for help. Thus, he doesn't consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin trusts it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, progressively critical) protest is additionally displayed. State welfare without authorizations neglects to reflect the way that working people who don't depend on welfare installments assume liability for their lives. On the off chance that an individual who works quits working, Shapiro watches, at that point they will normally locate their monetary circumstance intensified. Genuine state welfare does not mirror this, and rather mirrors the abnormal position of the individual who might be no more terrible off on the off chance that they would not work. As unequivocal welfare does not reflect the circumstance of conventional laborers, it is unfit to decide if individuals are eager to assume liability for their lives.
