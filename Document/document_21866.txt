On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting "more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with" at half a guinea an hour. He also worked as a rÃ©pÃ©titeur. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for Richard D'Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of "The Yeomen of the Guard" at the Savoy Theatre in 1888. His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur Sullivan about the score. Jacobs describes Wood's memoirs as "vivacious in style but factually unreliable".
It is certain, however, that Wood was rÃ©pÃ©titeur at Carte's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera "Ivanhoe" in late 1890 and early 1891, and for AndrÃ© Messager's "La Basoche" in 1891â92. He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to FranÃ§ois Cellier on "The Nautch Girl" in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, "St. Dorothea" (1889), a light opera, "Daisy" (1890), and a one-act comic opera, "Returning the Compliment" (1890).
