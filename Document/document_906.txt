In spite of the fact that it currently has measurements of and a width of , researchers think the first breakdown breadth was . It currently incorporates a few little magma vaults and ash cones, including Wizard Island and the submerged fountain of liquid magma Merriam Cone. The most noteworthy height in the Mazama Complex is presently Mount Scott, situated at a rise of , with an alleviation of above Crater Lake's surface waters. Aside from the tallest slants of the unpredictable, the sum total of what cones have been secured with stores from the climactic ejection at Mazama 7,700 years prior. Researchers currently utilize the uncovered substance of the caldera edge divider to examine ejections and mapping the eruptive history of the district. All through its known ejections, Mazama has delivered 43ÃÂ percent rhyodacite, 42ÃÂ percent andesite, 15ÃÂ percent dacite, and under 1ÃÂ percent basaltic andesite. The majority of the rhyodacite has been delivered inside the previous 30,000 years of action, proposing that provincial and neighborhood dispersion of pieces were not uniform after some time. Andesite and dacite magma streams from the spring of gushing lava more often than not have plagioclase as their major phenocryst, however augite and hypersthene are additionally present, the last progressively bottomless. Olivine structure minor phenocrysts, which are found all through magma streams from Mazama, and hornblende can be found in some andesite magma streams. Basalt and mafic andesite magma streams from Mazama and adjacent eruptive vents have generally higher measures of olivine and need hypersthene, and the mafic andesite stores show surfaces that demonstrate they experienced more prominent blending than andesite and dacite stores.
