The Puerto Rican amazon achieves sexual development at 4ÃÂ years of age in the wild and at 3ÃÂ years in bondage. The species for the most part repeats once every year between the long periods of January and July (the dry season). Fornication between sets is by all accounts firmly identified with sustenance exchanges, with this conceivably filling in as a trigger for intercourse. Amazons have a sex design like that found in different parrots all through the Americas, with the male holding a roost with one leg while inactively putting the other in the female's back. As the ideal opportunity for egg-laying approaches the pair invests more energy in the home, with the male giving sustenance to the female by means of spewing forth. The female lays 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ eggs that she only broods for a time of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be available in the region of the home while giving sustenance. Females just leave the home on uncommon events including repulsing predators or if the male has not acquired sustenance an all-inclusive time period. The chicks are nourished by the two guardians until they leave the home, as a rule 60 to 65ÃÂ days after they bring forth. In any case, they stay reliant on their folks and travel with them until the following rearing season.
