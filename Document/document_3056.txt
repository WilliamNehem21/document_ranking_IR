A late change in the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham supplant Gordon Buxton to guide the Dark Blues, turning into the eighth female cox ever of race. Oxford's Royle noticed that Buxton's structure had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was "taking care of the weight significantly better." Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, proposed that female coxes were not as cultivated as their male partners: "We had one cox who was astoundingly great at giving back rubs yet on the wholeÃÂ ... they're not forceful or sufficiently intense." Oxford additionally observed a change to their team in the week going before the race. Old Etonian undergrad Ed Haddon (who had paddled for Isis in 1992) was dropped for German Philipp Schuller. Schuller had touched base at Oxford only two months sooner, however dismissed proposals that his late incorporation was symptomatic of the ongoing convergence of "experts" to the race. Of his choice, he noted: "You can't have a standout amongst the most regarded races on the planet and afterward constrain it to English individuals between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would influence the pontoon to go quickest. It was done totally on legitimacy." Schuller's countryman and rival Dirk Bangert had battled with the move to blades, thinking that its hard to change his planning: "I almost didn't make it. I couldn't get this mood until around three weeks prior and didn't know of my place."
