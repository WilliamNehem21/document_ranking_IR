At first idea to have come up short on the sigmoid bend common of theropods, the neck of "Baryonyx" appears to have framed a S shape, however straighter than in different theropods. The cervical vertebrae of the neck decreased towards the head and turned out to be dynamically longer front to back. Their zygapophyses (the procedures that associated the vertebrae) were level, and their epipophyses (procedures to which neck muscles connected) were all around created. The hub vertebra (the second neck vertebra) was little in respect to the measure of the skull and had a very much created hyposphene. The neural curves of the cervical vertebrae was not generally sutured to the centra (the collections of the vertebrae), and the neural spines there were low and meager. The cervical ribs were short, like those of crocodiles, and potentially covered each other fairly. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae of the back were comparable in size. Like in different theropods, the skeleton of "Baryonyx" demonstrated skeletal pneumaticity, decreasing its weight through fenestrae (openings) in the neural curves and (empty dejections) in the centra (basically close to the transverse procedures). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and heavy to tall and wide. One disengaged dorsal neural spine was modestly stretched and thin, showing that "Baryonyx" may have had a protuberance or edge along the focal point of its back (however from early on created contrasted with those of different spinosaurids). "Baryonyx" was one of a kind among spinosaurids in having a checked narrowing from side to side in a vertebra that either had a place with the sacrum or front of the tail.
