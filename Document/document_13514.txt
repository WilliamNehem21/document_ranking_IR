Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy offers an arrangement to Sweet: she will replace her sister in the event that she can't slaughter him. At the point when asked by Sweet what she supposes about existence, Buffy gives her skeptical interpretation of its importance ("Something to Sing About"). At the point when the others arrive, she reveals that Willow took her from paradise, and Willow responds with ghastliness at discovering what she's finished. After unveiling this fact, Buffy abandons singing and moves so excitedly that she starts to smoke Ã¢ÂÂ very nearly combusting as Sweet's different unfortunate casualties have been appeared to do Ã¢ÂÂ until Spike stops her, revealing to her that the best way to go ahead is to simply continue carrying on with her life. Xander then uncovers that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, trusting he would be appeared upbeat completion for his marriage plans. Sweet, in the wake of discharging Xander from the commitment to be Sweet's "lady of the hour", tells the gathering how much fun they have been ("What You FeelÃ¢ÂÂReprise") and vanishes. The Scoobies understand that their connections have been changed irreversibly by the mysteries uncovered in their melodies ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, yet Buffy tails him out, and they kiss ("Coda").
