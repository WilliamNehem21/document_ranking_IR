McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome on board "Lord and Winge", an American-enlisted walrus seeker, while "Bear" at long last cruised for Wrangel Island. On 25 August "Bear" was ceased by ice from the island, and in the wake of neglecting to compel a path through, Cochran needed to come back to Nome for more coalÃ¢ÂÂa choice which, says Bartlett, gave him "days to attempt a man's spirit". Back in Nome Bartlett met Olaf Swenson, who had contracted "Ruler and Winge" for the season and was going to cruise for Siberia. Bartlett mentioned that, if conceivable, "Lord and Winge" stop by Wrangel Island and search for the stranded "Karluk" party. "Bear" left Nome on 4 September, a couple of days after Swenson's ship. "Ruler and Winge", with McConnell still on board, came to Wrangel Island on 7 September. That morning the gathering at Rodgers Harbor were stirred promptly toward the beginning of the day by the sound of a ship's whistle, and discovered "Lord and Winge" lying a fourth of a mile seaward. They were quickly exchanged to the ship, which at that point grabbed the rest of the stranded party who were stayed outdoors along the coast at Cape Waring. By the evening every one of the 14 survivors were on board.
