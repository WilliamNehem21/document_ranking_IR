"Banksia blechnifolia" is a prostrate shrub that grows to about high and spreads to across. It has thick horizontal stems up to long and thick that lie on top of the ground. They are covered in fine rusty-brown fur, which turns grey with age. The leathery herringbone leaves rise vertically from the stems on thick long petioles, which have two narrow ribs on the undersurface. The leaves themselves are long, with 8â22 deep lobes on each leaf edge. Narrowly triangular to roughly linear in shape and long, these lobes are either oppositely or alternately arranged along the leaf midline, and arise at 60â80 degrees. The leaf blade narrows for the top third of its length to a pointed apex. Flowering occurs from mid September to late November, with the flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arising at the ends of the stems. Up to high and wide, they are overall red-brown to salmon-coloured. The individual flowers are reddish pink with a cream base, fading to light brown and then grey as they age. The perianth is long, includes a 3.5â5Â mm limb and is covered in fine fur. Old flowers remain on the spike, obscuring the developing seed pods known as follicles. Up to 25 in number, these are covered in fur and oval, measuring long, by high, and wide.
