In 1973, the tambalacoque, otherwise called the dodo tree, was believed to color out on Mauritius, to which it is endemic. There were as far as anyone knows just 13 examples left, all assessed to be around 300 years of age. Stanley Temple estimated that it relied upon the dodo for its engendering, and that its seeds would sprout simply in the wake of going through the fowl's stomach related tract. He guaranteed that the tambalacoque was currently almost coextinct in view of the vanishing of the dodo. Sanctuary neglected reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds sprouted, but in all respects once in a while, without being scraped amid absorption. Others have challenged his theory and recommended that the decay of the tree was overstated, or seeds were additionally disseminated by other terminated creatures, for example, "Cylindraspis" tortoises, natural product bats or the expansive charged parrot. As indicated by Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two specialists in the nature of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while uncommon, has sprouted since the death of the dodo and numbers a few hundred, not 13 as asserted by Temple, subsequently disparaging Temple's view with regards to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.
