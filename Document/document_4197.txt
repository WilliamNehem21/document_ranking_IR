After Maiden Castle, Wheeler directed his concentration toward France, where the archeological examination of Iron Age locales had lingered behind advancements in Britain. There, he managed a progression of studies and unearthings with the guide of Leslie Scott, starting with an overview voyage through Brittany in the winter of 1936Ã¢ÂÂ 37. After this, Wheeler chose to uncover the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, close Huelgoat, FinistÃÂ¨re. Notwithstanding expediting numerous British archeologists to work the site, he procured six neighborhood Breton laborers to help the undertaking, going to the conviction that the oppidum had been raised by nearby Iron Age clans to protect themselves from the Roman attack driven by Julius Caesar. In the interim, Scott had been set responsible for an unearthing at the littler adjacent slope stronghold of Kercaradec, close Quimper. In July 1939, the undertaking concentrated on Normandy, with unearthings starting at the Iron Age slope fortresses of Camp de Canada and Duclair. They were conveyed to an unexpected end in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the group cleared back to Britain. Wheeler's exhuming report, co-composed with Katherine Richardson, was in the end distributed as "Slope fortifications of Northern France" in 1957.
