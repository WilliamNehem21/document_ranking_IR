In the 1962 Marsh Chapel Experiment, which was controlled by Pahnke at the Harvard Divinity School under the supervision of Timothy Leary, practically the majority of the advanced education godlikeness understudy volunteers who got psilocybin announced significant religious encounters. One of the members was religious researcher Huston Smith, writer of a few course books on relative religion; he later portrayed his experience as "the most dominant vast homecoming I have ever experienced." In a 25-year followup to the test, the majority of the subjects given psilocybin depicted their experience as having components of "an authentic supernatural nature and described it as one of the high purposes of their profound life". Hallucinogenic specialist Rick Doblin considered the investigation in part defective because of mistaken usage of the twofold visually impaired strategy, and a few uncertain inquiries in the otherworldly experience survey. By the by, he said that the investigation cast "a significant uncertainty on the affirmation that otherworldly encounters catalyzed by medications are in any capacity sub-par compared to non-sedate magical encounters in both their quick substance and long haul impacts". This supposition was reverberated by therapist William A. Richards, who in a 2007 survey expressed "[psychedelic] mushroom use may establish one innovation for inspiring life-changing encounters that are comparable, if not indistinguishable, to those that happen through purported unconstrained modifications of mind science."
