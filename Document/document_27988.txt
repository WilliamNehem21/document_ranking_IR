On 2 June the French liner "Jamaique" reported a small boat, flying the British flag and steaming southwards, near the Bissagos Islands south of Dakar. Although this was at first assumed to be "Girl Pat", the next reported sighting, on 9 June, was more than to the west, on the other side of the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the "Lorraine Cross," an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, north-east of Cayenne. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the "Margaret Harold" bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was "undoubtedly a British fisherman", and thought it was "Girl Pat". In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise at this new location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named "Margaret Harold".
