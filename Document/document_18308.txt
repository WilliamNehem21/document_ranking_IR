Despite his weak military situation, Ba Cá»¥t sought to disrupt the staging of a fraudulent referendum that Diá»m had scheduled to depose Báº£o Äáº¡i as head of state. Ba Cá»¥t distributed a pamphlet condemning Diá»m as an American puppet, asserting that the prime minister was going to "Catholicize" the country; the referendum was partly funded by the U.S. government and various Roman Catholic organisations. Diá»m had strong support from American Roman Catholic politicians and the powerful Cardinal Francis Spellman and his elder brother, Pierre Martin NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Thá»¥c, was Archbishop of Huáº¿. Ba Cá»¥t presciently noted that the referendum was a means ""for Diem to gather the people from all towns and force them to demonstrate one goal: to depose Bao Dai and proclaim the puppet Diem as the chief-of-state of Vietnam."" On the day of the poll, Ba Cá»¥t's men prevented voting in the border regions which they controlled, and ventured out of the jungles to attack polling stations in Cáº§n ThÆ¡. Despite that disruption, Diá»m was fraudulently credited with more than 90% of support in HÃ²a Háº£o-controlled territory, and a near unanimous turnout was recorded in the area. These results were replicated across the nation, and Diá»m deposed Báº£o Äáº¡i.
