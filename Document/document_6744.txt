To spread his expenses over more magazines, Silberkleit before long chose to dispatch two extra titles. In November 1939 the primary issue of "Future Fiction" showed up; it was followed in July 1940 by "Sci-fi Quarterly". Hornig was editorial manager for each of the three of the magazines. In October 1940, Hornig, who was a radical, got his military call-up. He chose to move to California and register as a pacifist; he kept on editting the magazines from the west coast, yet Silberkleit was discontent with the game plan. Silberkleit permitted Hornig to hold his post as supervisor of "Sci-fi", and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. Moskowitz declined, saying a short time later that he "could never strike at a man's activity", however Donald Wollheim, an individual from a gathering of hopeful scholars called the Futurians, caught wind of the offer. Wollheim disclosed to Robert W. Lowndes, another individual from the Futurians, about the opening, and asked him to write to Silberkleit. Lowndes later reviewed Wollheim's thought: "In the letter, I'd propose that it may be a smart thought to add a sci-fi title to the rundown, offering my administrations as proofreader at a marginally lower cost than Hornig was being paid, and furthermore criticize the various sf titles by and by out, however especially with Hornig's". Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the goad and enlisted him in November 1940; Hornig reviews the detachment as being by shared assent due to his turn to California. Lowndes thusly concurred this was probably going to be the genuine reason Silberkleit supplanted Hornig.
