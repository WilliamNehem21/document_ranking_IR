A third types of Lujiatun psittacosaur, the first to be named, was depicted as "Hongshanosaurus houi" in 2003. The nonexclusive name "Hongshanosaurus" was gotten from the Mandarin Chinese words Ã§Â´Â ("hÃÂ³ng": "red") and Ã¥Â±Â± ("shÃÂn": "slope"), just as the Greek word "sauros" ("reptile"). This name alludes to the old Hongshan culture of northeastern China, who lived in a similar general region in which the fossil skull of "Hongshanosaurus" was found. The sort and just named species, "H. houi", respects Hou Lianhai, an educator at the IVPP in Beijing, who curated the example. Variety and species were both named by Chinese scientistss You Hailu, Xu Xing, and Wang Xiaolin in 2003. Sereno (2010) viewed its unmistakable extents as because of squashing and pressure of the "Hongshanosaurus" skulls. He respected "Hongshanosaurus" as a lesser equivalent word of "Psittacosaurus", and conceivably equivalent to "P. lujiatunensis". He didn't synonymise the two species due to challenges with the holotype skull of "H. houi", rather considering new mix "P. houi" a "nomen dubium" inside "Psittacosaurus". Sereno's theory was upheld by a morphometric ponder in 2013, which discovered "P. houi" and "P. lujiatunensis" to be synonymous. While "P. houi" is the most seasoned accessible name, the scientists contended that on the grounds that the sort example of "P. lujiatunensis" was better safeguarded, the right name for this species ought to be "P. lujiatunensis" as opposed to "P. houi", which would regularly have need.
