The Second World War dedication appears as a semi-roundabout indented garden situated behind the First World War Memorial, to its north in Trinity Square Gardens. The possibility of a depressed greenery enclosure seems to have started from dialogs promptly following the finish of the war. There was an inclination among the new age of craftsmen and designers that the detailed and creative commemorations to the First World War did not catch the national disposition of grieving for the new flood of losses and that spaces, for example, gardens, which gave an area to singular grieving and reflection, were increasingly appropriate. As per the engineering history specialist Philip Ward-Jackson, Maufe's remembrance gives the impression of being a wing of a fanciful destroyed church, total with gave seatsÃ¢ÂÂa picture which would have had "amazing reverberation in the shelled City" (a great part of the encompassing region, including the Port of London Authority building, was seriously harmed by German besieging). The building student of history Nikolaus Pevsner depicted Maufe's expansion as "less self-assured" than the first dedication; he applauded the possibility of a remembrance to the missing as a void (the depressed greenery enclosure), yet felt it was let somewhere near Wheeler's "abnormally carefree" reliefs between the arrangements of names.
