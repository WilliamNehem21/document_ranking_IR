The game was first shown to the public at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2005 in a short pre-rendered trailer. It was later announced during Nintendo's press conference at the E3 2006. Nintendo revealed in May 2006 that "Corruption" would be released as a launch game for the Wii console, but a few months later it was delayed to 2007. In April 2007, Fils-AimÃ© stated in an interview that "Corruption" was "not going to ship by June" and set it at a summer 2007 release date at the earliest. Later he opined, "when we release it, it will be perfect. And if that's a little later than folks would have liked, I'm hoping they're going to be happy." In late April 2007, IGN editor Matt Casamassina revealed that "Corruption" would be shown in detail during May of that year, and that the game would be released on August 20, 2007, in the United States. Nintendo of America later announced to have moved the release date to August 27, 2007, but Nintendo finally announced an "in stores" date of August 28, 2007. The game was later released in Europe on October 26, 2007, and in Japan on March 6, 2008. In the Japanese version, the game's difficulty level is decided by answering to "a questionnaire from the Galactic Federation", in contrast to the North American version where the difficulty level is chosen directly by the player. "Metroid Prime" series producer Kensuke Tanabe said that an idea for a questionnaire came from Retro Studios.
