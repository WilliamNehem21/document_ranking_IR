Hoult was cast as Nux in George Miller's action film ""; the project spent several years in development hell because plans for a fourth film in the "Mad Max" franchise encountered financial difficulties. Filming was planned for mid-2010, but heavy rain caused severe delays during pre-production in Australia. With no other immediate commitments, Hoult began to look for other prospects. He was eventually cast in the role of Hank McCoy / Beast for the "X-Men" film series owing to his ability to play somebody "gentle with a capability of being fierce". Although earlier reports had said Benjamin Walker was to play the role, Hoult was finalised for the 2011 Matthew Vaughn-directed instalment "", a prequel to the franchise's earlier films. Before filming began, Hoult familiarised himself with his character; he said he "formulated [his] own version of the Beast" and took inspiration from Kelsey Grammer's performance in the previous "X-Men: The Last Stand" because he wanted to emulate Grammer's charm and eloquence. Hoult learnt to speak in a dialect similar to Grammer's without trying to imitate it. He also underwent physical training and gained weight to better suit his character. The film, which was widely praised by critics for its script and performances, performed moderately well at the box office, collecting about $353 million against a production budget of $160 million. Although it was the lowest-ranked production in the entire series in terms of revenue, Chris Aronson of 20th Century Fox deemed it "an excellent start to a new chapter of the franchise".
