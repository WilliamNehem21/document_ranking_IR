"Tricholoma pardinum" is found crosswise over Europe, where it is progressively basic in the south. It is inexhaustible in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The species is found in Belgium and Germany, yet has not been recorded from the Netherlands or the British Isles. A chronicled record from Estonia has been disposed of on the grounds that no herbarium examples could be found. In Asia, it has been recorded from Izmir Province in southwestern Turkey, China, and Sado Island in Japan. It is found generally crosswise over calm North America, where Santa Cruz County and Sierra Nevada in focal California in the west of the mainland, and the focal Appalachians in the east structure the southern furthest reaches of its dispersion. "T.ÃÂ pardinum" is ordinarily connected with conifers in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, and with tanoak ("Lithocarpus densiflorus") and madrone ("Arbutus" spp.) in California. The mushroom can be plentiful in certain years, particularly hotter years with higher precipitation, yet absent or uncommon for quite a long while in the middle. In Europe, it is found on pale soil in forest with beech and fir in summer and harvest time, where it inclines toward territories of some rise. In spite of the fact that it might be found in gatherings or pixie rings, it most usually happens separately.
