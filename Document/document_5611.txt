By 2004, Kapoor was enthused about expanding her range as an on-screen character and subsequently chose to depict all the more testing jobs. Under the bearing of Sudhir Mishra, Kapoor assumed the job of a brilliant hearted prostitute in "Chameli", a film relating the tale of a youthful whore who meets with a bereft speculation financier (played by Rahul Bose). At the point when Kapoor was at first offered the film she declined it, clarifying that she would be awkward in the job. She yielded when Mishra moved toward her for the second time, and in anticipation of the job, visited a few of Mumbai's shady areas of town during the evening to contemplate the quirks of sex specialists and the manner in which they dressed. "Chameli" was generally welcomed by commentators and the film denoted a critical defining moment in her vocation, winning Kapoor an uncommon jury acknowledgment at the 49th Filmfare Awards. Indiatimes lauded her "natural splendor" and expressed that she had surpassed all desires. Rediff.com, be that as it may, discovered her depiction unconvincing and unnecessarily clichÃÂ©, portraying her as "sounding more like an adolescent playacting than a reckless, solidified streetwalker" and contrasting her peculiarities with a cartoon.
