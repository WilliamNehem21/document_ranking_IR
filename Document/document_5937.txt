Athenian slaves were the property of their lord (or of the state), who could discard them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, lease, or give them. A slave could have a companion and youngster, however the slave family was not perceived by the state, and the ace could dissipate the relatives whenever. Slaves had less legal rights than natives and were spoken to by their lord in every single legal continuing. An offense that would result in a fine for the liberated person would result in a flagellating for the slave; the proportion appears to have been one lash for one drachma. With a few minor special cases, the declaration of a slave was not acceptable aside from under torment. Slaves were tormented in preliminaries since they frequently stayed faithful to their lord. A renowned case of a trusty slave was Themistocles' Persian slave Sicinnus (the partner of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, in spite of his Persian source, sold out Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Regardless of torment in preliminaries, the Athenian slave was secured in a roundabout way: on the off chance that he was abused, the ace could start case for harms and intrigue (/"dikÃÂ blabÃÂs"). On the other hand, an ace who too much abused a slave could be arraigned by any native (/"graphÃÂ hybreÃÂs"); this was not ordered for the slave, yet to stay away from savage overabundance (/"hubris").
