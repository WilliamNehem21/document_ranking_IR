Stearn made real commitments to plant scientific categorization and its history. In 1950 the Seventh International Botanical Congress was held in Stockholm, and the RHS would have been spoken to by Chittenden, however he had become sick. Bowles then orchestrated Stearn and Gilmour to speak to the general public in his stead. The congress delegated an exceptional panel to consider nomenclatural issues identified with developed plants, which wound up known as the Committee for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (the "Stockholm Committee"), with Stearn as secretary (1950Ã¢ÂÂ 1953). Stearn then proposed an International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the "Developed Code"), delivering the main draft that day. The code was acknowledged on a basic level by the board, restrictive on its endorsement by a parallel council of the International Horticultural Congress (the Horticultural Nomenclature Committee), which would next meet in London in 1952 (the "London Committee"). Soon thereafter Stearn was additionally named secretary of the London Committee with the goal that he currently spoken to the two associations. The two boards of trustees at that point met mutually on 22Ã¢ÂÂ 24 November 1951 at the RHS working in London to draft a last joint suggestion that was distributed by Stearn as secretary of a publication advisory group and embraced by the thirteenth International Horticultural Congress the next year.
