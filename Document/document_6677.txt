The Jordan River is the Utah Lake's solitary surge, and starts at the northern end of the lake between the urban communities of Lehi and Saratoga Springs. It at that point winds north through the north end of Utah Valley for roughly until it goes through a chasm in the Traverse Mountains, known as the Jordan Narrows. The Utah National Guard base at Camp Williams lies on the western side of the stream through a significant part of the Jordan Narrows. The Turner Dam, situated from the waterway's mouth (or at stream mile 41.8) and inside the limits of the Jordan Narrows, is the first of two dams of the Jordan River. Turner Dam occupies water to one side or easterly into the East Jordan Canal and to one side or westerly toward the Utah and Salt Lake Canal. Two siphoning stations, arranged beside Turner Dam, occupy water toward the west into the Provo Reservoir Canal, Utah Lake Distribution Canal and Jacob-Welby Canal. The Provo Reservoir Canal runs north through Salt Lake County, Jacob-Welby runs south through Utah County and the Utah Lake Distribution Canal runs both north and south in the long run driving once again into Utah Lake. Outside the strait, the stream achieves the second dam, known as Joint Dam, which is from the waterway's mouth. Joint Dam occupies water toward the east for the Jordan and Salt Lake City Canal and toward the west for the South Jordan Canal.
