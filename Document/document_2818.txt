Byrne recorded every one of the tracks, as they were after Belew had performed on them, to a tape and looked to Africa to break his temporarily uncooperative mind. He understood that, when African performers overlook words, they frequently ad lib and make new ones up. He utilized a convenient recording device and attempted to make onomatopoeic rhymes in the style of Eno, who trusted that verses were never the focal point of a melody's significance. Byrne persistently tuned in to his recorded scatting until persuaded that he was never again "hearing drivel". After he was fulfilled, Harrison welcomed Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the collection. She was exhorted widely on her vocal conveyance by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and frequently sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were trailed by the overdubbing procedure. Metal player Jon Hassell, who had been taking a shot at parts of "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts", was procured to perform trumpet and horn segments. In August 1980, half of the collection was blended by Eno and designer John Potoker in New York City with the help of Harrison, while the other half was blended by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.
