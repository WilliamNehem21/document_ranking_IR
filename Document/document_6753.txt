The second Test was severely influenced by climate and Hirst did not bat or bowl, and in the third Test in Sheffield, lost by England, he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets. Despite the fact that he fizzled at Sheffield, Hirst was the main all-rounder in England and in this manner probably not going to be let alone for the group. In any case, the England chief, Archie MacLaren, was occupied with a debate with the group selectors over the piece of his side. He was given just 12 players to browse for the fourth Test. Fred Tate was one of the twelve and the selectors likely included him as they trusted MacLaren couldn't in any way, shape or form pick him in the last eleven over another player thus would be compelled to handle the side they needed. MacLaren reacted by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of displeasure towards the selectors. The pitch was delicate, which would have favored the bowling of Tate, yet "Wisden" detailed that while this offered some legitimization for dropping Hirst, "it implied playing a bowler unadulterated and basic in inclination to a top notch all-round man, and the outcome demonstrated anything besides upbeat." Tate bowled only 16 overs in the diversion, dropped an essential catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the arrangement; later essayists asserted that Tate's execution was in charge of losing the match.
