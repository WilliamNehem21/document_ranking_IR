Jackson did not find the comments until they were distributed again in January 1817 because of a Boston paper's analysis of Kentucky minute men. He wrote to the "Kentucky Reporter" around then, reprimanding the comments as a falsification. The "Columnist" examined and distributed a clarification of how Thomas' comments had been credited to Jackson. They didn't republish Jackson's letter since they felt his case that the comments had been deliberately forgedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂa charge which was presently observed to be falseÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂwas excessively fiery. The editors guaranteed that if their withdrawal did not fulfill Jackson, they would completely distribute any of his extra comments regarding the matter. In Jackson's April 1817 reaction, he inferred that Adair had deliberately distorted the comments, and reasserted that they had been fashioned, perhaps by Adair himself. Adair trusted Jackson's references to the comments as a "produced dish, wearing the genuine Spanish style" was a not so subtle reference to Adair's supposed cooperation in the Burr connivance. As apparent verification that he was not inclined against Kentuckians, Jackson likewise inferred that he had not detailed extra disreputable conduct by Kentucky minute men amid the fight. This letter push the debate into the national spotlight and provoked Adair to continue correspondence with him both to shield Davis' men and disprove Jackson's charges of scheme. In his May 1817 reaction, he reasserted his protection of the Kentucky minute men at New Orleans and expelled a large number of Jackson's charges as irrelevant and false. He straight precluded the presence from securing an intrigue, and chastised Jackson for making charges without supporting proof. Reacting to Jackson's mention to Spain, Adair reviewed that Jackson had likewise been ensnared with Burr.
