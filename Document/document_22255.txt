The cost of building a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material. It is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around Â£200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which was built in the late 12thÂ century for Â£1,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about Â£7,000 between 1181 and 1191. Spending on the scale of the vast castles such as ChÃ¢teau Gaillard (an estimated Â£15,000 to Â£20,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from Â£1,000 to Â£10,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord's finances. Costs in the late 13thÂ century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing Â£14,500 and Â£9,000 respectively. Edward I's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost Â£80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and Â£95,000 between 1277 and 1329. Renowned designer Master James of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:
