Woods would not roll out any improvements to address the objections, so a formal hearing started on November 7. Woods was spoken to by celebrated lawyer Max Steuer, who was likewise a co-proprietor of the Eltinge Theater. The observers against the show included John S. Sumner, official secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, and Edward J. McGuire, bad habit executive of the Committee of Fourteen. On November 14, McAdoo decided that the play was vulgar, portraying it as "coarsely profane, blatantly and suggestively improper, sullied in word and activity". Woods was put on safeguard, and the case was alluded to the Court of Special Sessions for a wrongdoing allegation of arranging a revolting show. Woods effectively mentioned that the case be exchanged to the Court of General Sessions, which gave jury preliminaries and required a prosecution by a fantastic jury. He was blamed for disregarding area 1140a of the New York state punitive law, which precluded contribution in "any revolting, disgusting, shameless or sullied dramatization, play, display, show or excitement". The fantastic jury heard the case on December 23, 1921, however rejected it that equivalent day, despite the fact that they had heard just observers supporting the arraignment.
