Prior to leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's grasp and delegated him mutually with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to the workplace of Chief Justiciar, around then not carefully a legal office. Rather, the justiciar was the individual depended with a great part of the ruler's power when the lord was outside the kingdom, ready to act in the lord's name. Alongside Puiset, the ruler named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as partners in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges all through the nation to visit the shires on legal visits, despite the fact that he had no past learning of the legal executive. Longchamp and Puiset were unfit to cooperate, thus in March 1190 Richard gave expert north of the River Humber to Hugh, and specialist south of the waterway to Longchamp. Student of history's conclusions are partitioned whether Richard unequivocally made Longchamp better than Puiset right now, or if in principle the two should corresponding in their individual circles. By June, Longchamp had backed Puiset out of intensity and the justiciar's office. He likewise got a commission as an ecclesiastical legate from Pope Clement III as of now. As far as anyone knows Richard paid 1,500ÃÂ marks (ÃÂ£1,000) to the papacy to verify the legateship for Longchamp.
