For the job of Nellie, Rodgers looked for Mary Martin, who had about been cast to start the job of Laurey in "Oklahoma!" Martin was assuming the title job in the visiting organization of "Annie Get Your Gun". After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they requested that her think about the part. Martin was hesitant to sing inverse Pinza's ground-breaking voice; Rodgers guaranteed her he would make sure the two never sang in the meantime, a guarantee he for the most part kept. Rodgers and Martin lived close to one another in Connecticut, and after her visit Rodgers welcomed Martin and her better half, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three melodies for the melodic that he had finished, none of them for Nellie. "Some Enchanted Evening" particularly struck Martin, and albeit frustrated the melody was not for her, she consented to do the part. In spite of the fact that Nellie and Emile were at that point completely created characters in Michener's accounts, amid the formation of "South Pacific", Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan started to adjust the jobs explicitly to the abilities of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.
