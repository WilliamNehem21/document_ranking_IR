The soundtrack and sound were generally welcomed by faultfinders. Scullion trusted it to be the best out of any "Super Mario" amusement, announcing that each track coordinates the conditions included all through the diversion. Ward considered the coordinated music better than the visuals, saying that the dynamic sounds were "quintessentially Mario" yet uniquely complex. Reiner expressed that the organized soundtrack was excellent just as nostalgic, with Robinson also refering to it as "astonishing". Navarro lauded the modernized organized soundtrack, expressing that it was both great and "first rate". Williams thought the amusement highlighted the best stable on the Wii, expressing that unique soundtrack would "stand out forever" as Nintendo's best first-party exertion. An analyst from "GamesRadar" expressed that "Super Mario Galaxy" included the best instrumental pomposity at any point heard in a diversion. Bedigan stated that the soundtrack was "another progression forward" in computer game music, lauding the music as moving and amazing. Casamassina made a decision about the diversion's music "so excellent" and "completely sublime", abridging that it had the best music out of any Nintendo amusement to date. Hudak reprimanded the "customary Mario-esque" absence of voice acting, regardless of conceding that if the diversion featured voice acting it would "most likely appear to be faltering and off-base".
