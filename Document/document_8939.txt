Albeit pretty much every story that showed up in "Planet" could be depicted as space musical drama, there was some assortment of way to deal with the fundamental topics. Earth was some of the time compromised, however more frequently the move made spot on different universes, bringing Earthmen into neighborhood clashes. This frequently included excellent local princesses, however the sentimental storylines were stereotyped: in one story which showed up in Fall 1940, Carl Selwyn's "Venus Has Green Eyes", the Venusian princess is prevented from her contempt of people when the legend catches her and kisses her; she slaps him, yet surrenders to his appeal. Some rest from these delineations of ladies was given by Leigh Brackett, who depicted her very own courageous women as "typically on the obnoxious sideÃ¢ÂÂwarm-blooded, hot-tempered, however gutty and insightful" (with "disagreeable" proposed as a compliment). Amid World War II, it was in "Planet Stories" that a peruser was well on the way to run over a female character who could battle, rather than just being battled about. Sex itself had for quite some time been forbidden in the mash magazines, yet a few stories in "Planet" delineated sexuality more straightforwardly than the contending magazines would. The perusers were not continually tolerating; one peruser in a letter in 1949 upheld "casting off the taboos", yet a letter essayist in 1946 protested "Lorelei of the Red Mist", saying that he required "a half quart of Listerine to wash the grimy taste out of my mouth". The spread work of art for the most part underscored sex too, with what sf writer and faultfinder Harry Harrison cynically alluded to as "sexual dimorphism in space": overwhelming, practical spacesuits for the men, and straightforward suits through which swimming outfits or bathing suits could be seen for the ladies.
