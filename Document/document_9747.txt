ÃÂthelberht kicked the bucket in 616, amid Laurence's residency; his child Eadbald relinquished Christianity for Anglo-Saxon agnosticism, compelling a considerable lot of the Gregorian preachers to escape the agnostic kickback that pursued ÃÂthelberht's passing. Among them in Gaul were Mellitus, who was Bishop of London, and Justus, who was Bishop of Rochester. Staying in Britain, Laurence prevailing with regards to reconverting Eadbald to Christianity. Bede relates the story that Laurence had been set up to surrender when he was visited by St Peter in a fantasy or vision. St Peter chastised Laurence and whipped him, and the characteristics of the whipping stayed after the vision or dream finished. Laurence then shown them to Eadbald, and the ruler was changed over on the spot. Bede, notwithstanding, indications that it was the passing of a portion of the pioneers of the agnostic party in fight that truly induced Laurence to remain. As indicated by Benedicta Ward, an antiquarian of Christianity, Bede utilizes the narrative of the whipping for instance of how enduring was a notice of Christ's languishing over people, and how that model could prompt transformation. Wright contends that another point Bede is making is that it is a direct result of the mediation of St Peter himself that the mission proceeded. David Farmer, in the "Oxford Dictionary of Saints", proposes that the whipping story may have been a mixing of the "Quo Vadis" story with some data given by Jerome in a letter.
