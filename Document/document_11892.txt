Charles Harmison was conceived in Franklin County, Illinois, to Nathaniel and Lydia Harmison, and wedded Bettie Ann Smith (1827Ã¢ÂÂ 1903) on May 4, 1854, in Taylor County, West Virginia. Bettie, the little girl of C.C. also, Martha W. Smith, was raised at Western View (their Fauquier County, Virginia, home). By 1867, Harmison and his family were living in Harrison County. His more established sibling had moved to Romney, where he set up and worked the Virginia House inn. In 1867, Charles Harmison's sibling discovered that the Parsons ranch on the Collins Tract was available to be purchased, and he prompted Charles to get it. Charles' better half, who needed to live closer to Virginia, additionally asked Charles to purchase the property. Charles obtained the ranch and he, his significant other, their seven youngsters, and a youthful African American kid named Snoden moved from Harrison County to Hampshire County in three days. They went on the Northwestern Turnpike in a rescue vehicle Charles had purchased after the war. Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and homestead Valley View, which was affected by the name of her youth home, Western View, and the perspective on the South Branch Potomac River valley from their property.
