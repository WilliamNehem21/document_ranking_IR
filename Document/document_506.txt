A general decision was brought in Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins, suddenly lost a vote in the Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month prior to decision day, Smith was drawn closer by individuals from the resistance Liberal Party who approached him to represent them in Selukwe. Jacob Smit's Liberals, regardless of their name, were unequivocally illiberal, primarily speaking to business cultivating, mining and modern interests. Smith was at first hesitant, saying he was too caught up with sorting out his life to stand, yet concurred after one of the Liberal authorities recommended that a political vocation may enable him to protect the qualities he had battled for in the Second World War. With their wedding scarcely a fortnight away, Janet was dumbfounded to learn of Smith's choice to keep running for parliament, having at no other time heard him examine legislative issues. "I can't state that I am truly keen on gathering legislative issues," Smith disclosed to her, "however I've generally been most inspired by sound government." Smith appropriately turned into a Liberal Party lawmaker, concluded his buy of Gwenoro, and wedded Janet, embracing her two kids as his own, all in half a month in August 1948. They delighted in a couple of days' wedding trip at Victoria Falls, at that point went straight into the race battle.
