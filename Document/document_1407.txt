Following the downfall of the Calusa and Tequesta, Native Americans in southern Florida were alluded to as "Spanish Indians" during the 1740s, most likely because of their friendlier relations with Spain. Between the Spanish thrashing in the Seven Years' War in 1763 and the finish of the American War of Independence in 1783, the United Kingdom ruled Florida. The main known utilization of the expression "Seminolie" is from a British Indian specialist in a report dated 1771. The beginnings of the clan are unclear, however records demonstrate that Creeks attacked the Florida landmass, vanquishing and acclimatizing what was left of pre-Columbian social orders into the Creek Confederacy. The blending of societies is clear in the language impacts present among the Seminoles: different Muskogean dialects, prominently Hitchiti, and Creek, just as Timucuan. In the mid nineteenth century, a US Indian operator clarified the Seminoles along these lines: "The word Seminole implies runaway or severed. HenceÃÂ ... relevant to every one of the Indians in the Territory of Florida as every one of them ran awayÃÂ ... from the CreekÃÂ ... Country". Semantically, the expression "Seminole" originates from a debasement of the Spanish word "cimarron," comparing their transitory history to wild ponies. The customary Muskogee Creek Language does not have a rhotic phoneme. There was a metathesis of the penultimate and extreme syllables.
