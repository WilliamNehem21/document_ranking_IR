In March 1944, Bedri Pejani, the administrator of the Second League of Prizren, an association made after the Italian surrender to propel the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a power of 120,000Ã¢ÂÂ 150,000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to battle the Yugoslav and Albanian partisans. Pejani requested that the German authority give the Albanians hardware and supplies to battle the socialist rebellion, and mentioned the development of the fringes of the German manikin province of Albania to the detriment of the German involved region of Serbia and the German involved domain of Montenegro. These solicitations were not satisfied. In any case, in April 1944, Himmler requested the foundation of the new Albanian volunteer division that Hitler had approved. It was consequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior Skanderbeg. By this point, the Germans and a few individuals from the Albanian manikin government trusted that around 50,000 ethnic Albanians could be enlisted to join the "Waffen-SS". The Germans had at first imagined a power of 10,000Ã¢ÂÂ 12,000 men for the Albanian SS division. Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential wellspring of labor in Germany's war against the Yugoslav Partisans, who confronted noteworthy challenges in enlisting Kosovo Albanians to join their positions.
