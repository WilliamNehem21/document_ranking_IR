While in its origins, Joy was experiencing upper-level wind shear, but as it approached the jet stream while turning to the southwest, conditions became more favourable for intensification. The storm quickly intensified, reaching the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on 21Â December. At 00:00Â UTC on 23Â December, the Bureau estimated Joy reached peak 10-minute sustained winds of , which made the system a category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Around the same time, the JTWC also estimated the same peak winds, but sustained over one minute. Joy developed an eye about in diameter with concentric eyewalls. The storm began moving slowly off the northeast coast of Australia, passing within of Cairns, and the motion shifted to a southeast drift. A building high pressure area to the south caused the change in movement, and there were initial concerns the storm would loop to the west and affect Cairns again. Drier air caused Joy to weaken gradually from its peak to the equivalent of a strong tropical storm. At 06:00Â UTC on 26Â December, after turning back to the southwest, the storm made landfall near Townsville, Queensland, with winds estimated at . That day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and on 27Â December, Joy dissipated inland over Queensland. A remnant system persisted into early January, producing continued rainfall across Queensland.
