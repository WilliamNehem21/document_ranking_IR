Andreas GrÃ¼nschloÃ analyzes the Xenu text in "The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements", within the context of a discussion on UFO religions. He characterizes the text as "Scientology's secret mythology (contained especially in the OT III teachings)". GrÃ¼nschloÃ points out that L. Ron Hubbard, "also wrote a science fiction story called "Revolt in the Stars", where he displays this otherwise arcane story about the ancient ruler Xenu in the form of an ordinary science fiction novel". GrÃ¼nschloÃ posits, "because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard's novels and specific Scientology teachings, one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction (or fantasy literature generally) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement." Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth, GrÃ¼nschloÃ writes, "Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other 'techno-logical' disclosures of Hubbard, they are highly appreciated by participants, and Hubbard's literary output in this realm (including the latest movie, "Battlefield Earth") is also well promoted by the organization." Writing in the book "UFO Religions" edited by Christopher Partridge, GrÃ¼nschloÃ observes, "the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology. Indeed, even the highly arcane story of the intergalactic ruler XenuÂ ... is related by Hubbard in the style of a simple science fiction novel".
