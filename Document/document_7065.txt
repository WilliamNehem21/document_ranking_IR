In 1938 Horne enrolled in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on low maintenance preparing plan. He was charged as an acting pilot officer in No. 911 (County of Warwick) Squadron, a blast swell unit in Sutton Coldfield, and was called up into the RAF full-time on the flare-up of war. In the underlying months of the contentionÃ¢ÂÂthe Phony WarÃ¢ÂÂHorne's obligations were undemanding, and he framed a show party from his companions and associates. In November 1940 he was elevated to flight lieutenant, and to squadron pioneer per year later. In mid 1942, the BBC maker Bill McLurg asked whether the RAF station at which Horne was put together could put with respect to a release of his program "Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer". Horne was requested to put on the show, and he made his telecom debut on 16 April 1942, as the compere. In spite of the fact that the standard of the ability on the show was not high, McLurg was awed with Horne's introduction, particularly the manner in which he facilitated the program's test; he welcomed Horne to be the program's ordinary quizmaster, a job the last satisfied on more than fifty "Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer" tests throughout the following two years. In January 1943 he wound up one of the show's ordinary comperes and introduced the whole show out of the blue.
