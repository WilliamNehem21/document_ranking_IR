Spain's push to recover sway over Gibraltar was fuelled by the decolonisation plan of the United Nations, which had been started in 1946. In that year, Britain had recorded Gibraltar among other "Abroad Dependent Territories" related to the drive towards decolonisation, yet it was not acknowledged at the time that Gibraltar was in a special position; because of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it must be British or Spanish and couldn't pick up freedom. Franco's administration determined that Britain would surrender a costly belonging that never again had a lot of military esteem, however this ended up being a major misjudgement. The British government pursued an arrangement of enabling its provinces to end up self-administering elements before giving them the choice of freedom. Practically all took it, getting to be free republics. That alternative was not accessible to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain at any point surrendered control it was to be given back to Spain. The Gibraltarians unequivocally restricted this and sorted out a submission in September 1967 in which 12,138 voters picked to stay with Britain and just 44 bolstered association with Spain. Spain expelled the result of the choice, calling the city's occupants "pseudo-Gibraltarians" and expressing that the "genuine" Gibraltarians were the relatives of the Spanish occupants who had resettled somewhere else in the district more than 250 years sooner.
