"Expressway 61 Revisited" has stayed among the most exceptionally acclaimed of Dylan's works. Biographer Anthony Scaduto acclaims its rich symbolism, and depicts it as "a standout amongst the most splendid pop records at any point made. As shake, it slices through profoundly of the musicÃ¢ÂÂa hard driving beat without ruffles, without reluctance." Michael Gray calls "Thruway 61" "progressive and staggering, for its vitality and panache as well as in its vision: combining radical, electrical musicÃÂ ... with verses that were light a very long time in front of anybody else's; Dylan here joins the power of blues-based rock'n'roll with the intensity of verse. The entire shake culture, the entire post-Beatle pop-shake world, thus in an imperative sense the 1960s began here." In the sentiment of "PopMatters" faultfinder Hank Kalet, the collection was the most "jolting" shake and move record ever and "one of a bunch of collections (counting the Beatles' "Elastic Soul" and "Pistol") that gave educated rockers the green light to make a sort of shrewd, examining rock music that had not existed previously". "This original people shake great" exhibited "Dylan's fuming, not-exactly wild vocal conveyance and an unpleasant and-tumble instrumental assault", just as his "change from a society artist to a stone and roller", Sam Sutherland wrote in "High Fidelity".
