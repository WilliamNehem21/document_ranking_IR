VV Corvi is a nearby spectroscopic twofold, its two part stars circling each other with a time of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white principle arrangement stars of ghostly kind F5V, however the essential has started extending and cooling as it nears the finish of its time on the primary grouping. The mass proportion of the two stars is 0.775 ÃÂ± 0.024. A tertiary friend was found amid the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an overshadowing paired that shifts in splendor from evident greatness 11.16 to 12.5 more than 9 hours. Its period has expanded by 1/4 second over a century. It is an uncommon framework in that its two stars are near one another yet have distinctive surface temperatures, and thus warm exchange isn't occurring obviously. SX Corvi is an overshadowing paired that is additionally a contact parallel known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two segment stars circle firmly enough to one another for mass to have been exchanged between themÃ¢ÂÂfor this situation the optional having exchanged a lot of mass to the essential. RV Corvi is another overshadowing twofold. Its splendor differs from clear size 8.6 to 9.16 more than 18 hours. The framework is made out of stars of ghastly sorts F0 and G0, which circle each other each 0.7473 days.
