In 2006, Weems protected his 2003 appraisal of "Eubrontes", and proposed a creature like "Dilophosaurus" as conceivable trackmaker of various "Kayentapus" trackways of the Culpeper Quarry in Virginia. Weems proposed adjusted impressions related with a portion of these trackways to speak to hand impressions lacking digit follows, which he deciphered as a hint of quadrupedal development. In 2009 the American scientistss Andrew R.C. Milner and partners utilized the new mix "Kayentapus soltykovensis", and proposed that "Dilophosauripus" may not be particular from "Eubrontes" and "Kayentapus". They proposed that the long paw denotes that were utilized to recognize "Dilophosauripus" might be a curio of hauling. They found that "Gigandipus" and "Anchisauripus" tracks may in like manner additionally simply speak to varieties of "Eubrontes". They called attention to that contrasts between ichnotaxa may reflect how the track-producer collaborated with the substrate as opposed to scientific categorization. They additionally discovered "Dilophosaurus" an appropriate counterpart for an "Eubrontes" trackway and resting follow (SGDS.18.T1) from the St.George Dinosaur Discovery Site in the Moenave Formation of Utah, however the dinosaur itself isn't known from the arrangement, which is somewhat more established than the Kayenta Formation. Weems expressed in 2019 that "Eubrontes" tracks don't mirror the gracile feet of "Dilophosaurus", and contended they were rather made by the bipedal sauropodopormph "Anchisaurus".
