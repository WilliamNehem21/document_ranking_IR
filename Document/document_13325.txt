The focal point of act 3, maybe of the whole musical show, is Orfeo's all-inclusive aria "Possente spirto e formidabil nume" ("Mighty soul and incredible heavenliness"), by which he endeavors to convince Caronte to enable him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso backup give what Carter depicts as "a standout amongst the most convincing visual and aural portrayals" in early musical drama. Instrumental shading is given by a chitarrone, a pipe-organ, two violins, two cornetts and a twofold harp. This exhibit, as per music history specialist and examiner John Whenham, is expected to recommend that Orfeo is tackling all the accessible powers of music to help his request. In act 4 the unoriginal briskness of the Underworld is broken by the glow of Proserpina's singing for the benefit of Orfeo, a glow that is held until the sensational minute at which Orfeo "thinks back". The virus hints of the sinfonia from the earliest starting point of act 3 at that point advise us that the Underworld is, all things considered, totally without human inclination. The concise last act, which sees Orfeo's salvage and transformation, is confined by the last appearance of La musica's ritornello and the vivacious moresca that closes the musical show. This move, says Ringer, reviews the dances moved toward the finish of Shakespeare's disasters, and gives a methods for taking the gathering of people back to their regular world, "similarly as the toccata had driven them into another domain around two hours prior. The toccata and the moresca join cultured reality with operatic dream."
