Despite the fact that Elgar is frequently viewed as a normally English arranger, the majority of his melodic impacts were not from England but rather from mainland Europe. He felt himself to be an untouchable, musically, yet socially. In melodic circles ruled by scholastics, he was a self-educated arranger; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was respected with doubt in certain quarters; and in the class-cognizant society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was intensely delicate about his unassuming starting points even after he accomplished acknowledgment. He in any case wedded the little girl of a senior British armed force officer. She enlivened him both musically and socially, however he attempted to make progress until his forties, when after a progression of respectably effective works his "Conundrum Variations" (1899) turned out to be quickly well known in Britain and abroad. He pursued the Variations with a choral work, "The Dream of Gerontius" (1900), in view of a Roman Catholic content that caused some restlessness in the Anglican foundation in Britain, however it progressed toward becoming, and has remained, a center repertory work in Britain and somewhere else. His later full-length religious choral works were generally welcomed yet have not entered the ordinary repertory.
