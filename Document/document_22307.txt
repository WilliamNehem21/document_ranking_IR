Adverse winds as well as damaged and leaky boats slowed the American fleet's progress. At Schuyler Island, "Providence" and "Jersey" were sunk or burned, and crude repairs were effected to other vessels. The cutter "Lee" was also abandoned on the western shore and eventually taken by the British. Around 2:00Â pm, the fleet sailed again, trying to make headway against biting winds, rain, and sleet. By the following morning, the ships were still more than from Crown Point, and the British fleet's masts were visible on the horizon. When the wind finally changed, the British had its advantage first. They closed once again, opening fire on "Congress" and "Washington", which were in the rear of the American fleet. Arnold first decided to attempt grounding the slower gunboats at Split Rock, short of Crown Point. "Washington", however, was too badly damaged and too slow to make it, and she was forced to strike her colors and surrender; 110 men were taken prisoner.
Arnold then led many of the remaining smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship "Congress". The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found "Trumbull", "New York", "Enterprise", and "Revenge", all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as "Liberty", which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.
