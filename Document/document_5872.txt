In early matches of the 1938 season, with an Ashes arrangement against Australia pending, Hutton made three centuries and scored 93 not out. Chosen for a Test preliminary, he shared a century opening association with Bill Edrich, and was chosen for the main Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham starting on 28 June. In a little more than three hours, Hutton scored 100 from 221 conveyances on his Ashes debut, including 219 with Charlie Barnett for the main wicket. Britain, in Wally Hammond's first match as Test chief, posted an aggregate of 658 for eight wickets, yet the match was drawn. Hutton bombed in the second Test, with two single figure scores in another drawn amusement. He was commonly fruitless with the bat in the next weeks, amid which the third Test was completely rained off. Following a grouping of low scores for Yorkshire, Hutton's finger was broken in a match against Middlesex played on a perilous pitch at Lord's. Therefore, he couldn't play in the fourth Test, played at his home ground, Headingley, in which England were soundly beaten. In the wake of missing a month of cricket, Hutton played only two amusements before his determination for the last Test of the arrangement.
