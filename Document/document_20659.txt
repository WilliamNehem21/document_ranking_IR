The underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, "Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "The Monster That Challenged the World". Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: "The Thing from Another World", which Gottlieb described as "a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel"; and "It Came From Outer Space", where "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself". Scholars such as Thomas Schatz described how "Jaws" melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half provides a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the "Orca", and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. Ian Freer describes "Jaws" as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as "King Kong" and "Godzilla". Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared "Jaws" to "Godzilla"; and Spielberg cited "Godzilla, King of the Monsters!" (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the "masterful" way in which "it made you believe it was really happening."
