Heinlein quickly ended up a standout amongst the most productive supporters of "Surprising", distributing just about two dozen short stories in the following two years, alongside three books: "If This Goes OnÃ¢ÂÂ", "6th Column", and "Methuselah's Children". In September 1940, van Vogt's first novel, "Slan", started serialization; the book was incompletely roused by a test Campbell set down to van Vogt that it was difficult to recount to a superman story from the perspective of the superman. It ended up being a standout amongst the most mainstream stories Campbell distributed, and is a case of the manner in which Campbell worked with his essayists to encourage them thoughts and produce the material he needed to purchase. Asimov's "Robot" arrangement started to come to fruition in 1941, "Reason" and "Liar!" showing up in the April and May issues; as with "Slan", these accounts were somewhat roused by discussions with Campbell. The September 1941 issue incorporated Asimov's short story "Dusk", a standout amongst the most commended sf stories at any point composed, and in November, "Second Stage Lensmen", a novel in Smith's "Lensman" arrangement, started serialization. The next year saw the start of Asimov's "Establishment" stories, with "Establishment" showing up in May and "Harness and Saddle" in June. Van Vogt's "Enrolling Station", in the March issue, was the principal story in his "Weapon Shop" arrangement, depicted by John Clute as the most convincing of all van Vogt's work.
