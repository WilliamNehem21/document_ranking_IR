The spread utilized for discharges in Japan and PAL districts was drawn by Ueda himself, and was enlivened by the Italian craftsman Giorgio de Chirico and his work "The Nostalgia of the Infinite". Ueda trusted that "the surrealistic universe of de Chirico coordinated the allegoric universe of Ico". The North American form comes up short on this spread just as extra highlights that become accessible after the player finishes the amusement once. The improvement group was unfit to give Ueda's spread or the extra highlights, for example, the two-player mode in time for Sony's arranged North American discharge date, yet included them for the later discharges in Japan and PAL locales. On reflection, Yasuhide Kobayashi, VP of Sony's Japan Studio, trusted the North American box craftsmanship and absence of a recognizable English title prompted the amusement's poor deals in the United States, and expressed designs to address that for the arrival of "The Last Guardian". For its unique discharge, a restricted version of the diversion was accessible in PAL areas that incorporated a cardboard wrapping showing work of art from the amusement and four craftsmanship cards inside the crate. The diversion was re-discharged as a standard version in 2006 over all PAL districts aside from France after the 2005 arrival of "Shadow of the Colossus", "Ico"s profound spin-off, to enable players to "fill the hole in their accumulation".
