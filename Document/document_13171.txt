Commander S. H. Carlill expected direction on 24 June and the "Famous" continued deck-landing preparing. On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 research air ship made the first since forever arrivals by a cleared wing airplane on board a bearer. This flying machine was one of the predecessors of the Supermarine Swift warrior. After a month the ship started a four-month refit and facilitated the main bearer arriving of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she facilitated the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet. Chief C. T. Jellicoe mitigated Carlill on 27 August and the ship carried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta starting on 1 October. She traded them for Firebrands for the arrival voyage. On 3 November she started stacking the 39th Infantry Brigade of the third Infantry Division in light of the mobs in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt repealed the Anglo-Egyptian bargain of 1936. She set sail two days after the fact and touched base at Famagusta on 11 November. She came back to Portsmouth on 19 November and started stacking the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the first Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days after the fact. "Famous" set sail on 23 November and came to Famagusta on 29 November. She came back to Portsmouth on 7 December and she didn't leave harbor until 30 January 1952 when she continued her standard job as a preparation transport.
