Friedrich's cutting edge restoration picked up force in 1906, when thirty-two of his works were included in a presentation in Berlin of Romantic-period workmanship. His scenes practiced a solid effect on crafted by German craftsman Max Ernst (1891Ã¢ÂÂ 1976), and thus different Surrealists came to see Friedrich as an antecedent to their development. In 1934, the Belgian painter RenÃÂ© Magritte (1898Ã¢ÂÂ 1967) paid tribute in his work "The Human Condition", which legitimately echoes themes from Friedrich's craft in its scrutinizing of discernment and the job of the watcher. A couple of years after the fact, the Surrealist diary "Minotaure" included Friedrich in a 1939 article by pundit Marie Landsberger, along these lines presenting his work to a far more extensive hover of specialists. The impact of "The Wreck of Hope" (or "The Sea of Ice") is obvious in the 1940Ã¢ÂÂ 41 painting "Totes Meer" by Paul Nash (1889Ã¢ÂÂ 1946), an intense admirer of Ernst. Friedrich's work has been refered to as a motivation by other major twentieth century specialists, including Mark Rothko (1903Ã¢ÂÂ 1970), Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), Gotthard Graubner and Anselm Kiefer (b. 1945). Friedrich's Romantic sketches have likewise been singled out by author Samuel Beckett (1906Ã¢ÂÂ 89), who, remaining before "Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon", said "This was the wellspring of "Sitting tight for Godot", you know."
