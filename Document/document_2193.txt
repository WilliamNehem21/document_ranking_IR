In the late 2000s RNC experienced noteworthy rebuilding as it reacted to changes in the realm of work and in this way the courses that it offered its understudies. Notwithstanding, a portion of the school's progressions incited analysis from staff and understudies who contended these were not to RNC's greatest advantage. There was some debate over the school's choice to lessen the accessibility of courses in piano tuning, customarily viewed as a protected calling for outwardly debilitated individuals, while fears were communicated that the abatement in A Level subjects would prompt RNC turning into a game instead of a scholarly orientated school. Reacting to these worries in July 2008, the then essential Christine Steadman told "In Touch", the BBC Radio 4 news program for outwardly debilitated audience members; "It's about what the neighborhood specialists, what the learning and aptitudes chamber, what the Welsh Assembly for government will buy from us. Also, right now we are diminishing few A Level courses and yet we're broadening different courses, for instance we have level 3 Braille being instructed out of the blue at the school, we're not cutting A Levels, we're simply reacting to the necessities of the students that are getting through our entryways." In a meeting in January 2010, the then key Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be educated at the school if there was an interest for it, and proposed RNC could hope to acquiring universal understudies to fill places.
