Amid the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, colossal stores of uranium were amassed and a huge number of atomic weapons were made utilizing advanced uranium and plutonium produced using uranium. Since the separation of the Soviet Union in 1991, an expected 600ÃÂ short tons (540ÃÂ metric tons) of profoundly advanced weapons grade uranium (enough to influence 40,000 atomic warheads) to have been put away in regularly insufficiently monitored offices in the Russian Federation and a few other previous Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on no less than 16 events from 1993 to 2005 have caught shipments of carried bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, the vast majority of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, worked by the central legislature of the United States, spent roughly US $550 million to help shield uranium and plutonium stores in Russia. This cash was utilized for upgrades and security improvements at research and storerooms. "Logical American" revealed in February 2006 that in a portion of the offices security comprised of steel wall which were in extreme conditions of dilapidation. As per a meeting from the article, one office had been putting away examples of enhanced (weapons grade) uranium in a floor brush wardrobe before the improvement venture; another had been monitoring its supply of atomic warheads utilizing record cards kept in a shoe box.
