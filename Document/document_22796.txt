Now parallel and north of London Line, the former route of HighwayÂ 7 (the predecessor route between Sarnia and London),
the freeway jogs north to travel along the back lot line of farmland fronting London Line and the concession road north of HighwayÂ 402.
In this manner, the freeway did not divide any farms when it was constructed, instead running between them. It meets Lambton County RoadÂ 21 (Oil Heritage Road), the northern terminus of the Oil Heritage Route, north of the town of Wyoming. The county road is also a former southern extension of HighwayÂ 21, which itself begins as Forest Road to the east. HighwayÂ 21 is also known as the Bluewater Route, as most of its length is parallel to the shore of Lake Huron.
After passing an interchange with Forest Road, the freeway is crossed by London Line and momentarily diverges from its straight alignment to dip south of Warwick. It continues east through large patches of farmland, then meets with Middlesex County RoadÂ 81 (Victoria Street) at an interchange as it passes north of Strathroy.
Shortly thereafter it curves to the southeast and zig-zags towards London, bisecting farms and dividing woodlands. The freeway passes to the west of the town of Delaware and curves east. It enters London and meets interchanges with Colonel Talbot Road south of Lambeth, as well as with Wonderland Road before merging into Highway 401. Access to westbound and from eastbound Highway 401 is provided via Colonel Talbot Road or HighwayÂ 4 (Wonderland Road).
