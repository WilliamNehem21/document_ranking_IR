Emanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, presented the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee was the main advisory group to think about the bill. The board's positioning Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), for the most part upheld extending casting a ballot rights, yet he contradicted both the survey charge boycott and the inclusion recipe, and he drove resistance to the bill in advisory group. The board of trustees in the end affirmed the bill on May 12, however it didn't record its advisory group report until June 1. The bill included two alterations from subcommittee: a punishment for private people who meddled with the privilege to cast a ballot, and a preclusion of all survey charges. The survey charge preclusion picked up Speaker of the House John McCormack's help. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose seat, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), contradicted the bill and postponed its thought until June 24, when Celler started procedures to have the bill released from board of trustees. Under strain from the bill's advocates, Smith enabled the bill to be discharged seven days after the fact, and the full House began discussing the bill on July 6.
