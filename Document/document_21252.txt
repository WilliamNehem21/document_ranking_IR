With extremely few exceptions, all Rossini's compositions before the "PÃ©chÃ©s de vieillesse" of his retirement involve the human voice. His very first surviving work (apart from a single song) is however a set of string sonatas for two violins, cello and double-bass, written at the age of 12, when he had barely begun instruction in composition. Tuneful and engaging, they indicate how remote the talented child was from the influence of the advances in musical form evolved by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven; the accent is on cantabile melody, colour, variation and virtuosity rather than transformational development. These qualities are also evident in Rossini's early operas, especially his "farse" (one-act farces), rather than his more formal "opere serie". Philip Gossett notes that these early works were written at a time when "[t]he deposited mantles of Cimarosa and Paisiello were unfilled" â these were Rossini's first, and increasingly appreciated, steps in trying them on. The Teatro San MoisÃ¨ in Venice, where his "farse" were first performed, and the La Scala Theatre of Milan which premiered his two-act opera "La pietra del paragone" (1812), were seeking works in that tradition; Gossett notes that in these operas "Rossini's musical personality began to take shapeÂ ... many elements emerge that remain throughout his career" including "[a] love of sheer sound, of sharp and effective rhythms". The unusual effect employed in the overture of "Il signor Bruschino", (1813) deploying violin bows tapping rhythms on music stands, is an example of such witty originality.
