Cordray challenged the Ku Klux Klan's entitlement to erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's solicitation amid the 1993 Christmas occasion. He contended that the emblematic importance of the cross was not the same as the Christmas tree and menorah, which the state licenses. The Klan won in the sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and raised a 10-foot (3ÃÂ m) cross the next day. A similar board denied the Klan a license to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) because of the gathering's inability to pay a $15,116 greenback from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to present a bond on spread costs for the proposed rally. At the point when the equivalent sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upset the choice to deny the 1994 grant, the state decided not to bid. The next year the Klan again connected to erect a cross for the Christmas season, and the sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the earlier running the show. The United States Supreme Court did not consent to hear contentions on the point until half a month after Cordray left his specialist general position. After his renunciation in 1994 he a few times spoke to the central government in the U.S. Preeminent Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by arrangement of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Shrub Justice Department.
