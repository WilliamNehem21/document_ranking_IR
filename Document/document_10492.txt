On April 21, 1775, Governor Dunmore had the Royal Marines under his order catch explosive from the magazine in Williamsburg and take it to a maritime ship. The explosive had a place with the legislature, to be issued if there should be an occurrence of need, for example, a slave uprising. Dunmore's activities insulted numerous Virginians. Henry had withdrawn for Philadelphia, having been chosen an agent to the Second Continental Congress, yet a flag-bearer got up to speed with him before he left Hanover County, and he came back to assume responsibility for the neighborhood civilian army. Looking for the rebuilding of the powder, or that the pilgrims be made up for it, on May 2, Henry drove his troops towards Williamsburg with, as Dunmore expressed, "every one of the Appearances of real War". At this point, expression of the Battles of Lexington and Concord had arrived, and numerous Virginians trusted that war with Britain had started. With his troops fortified by enthusiastic volunteers from close-by regions, Henry likely had power enough to take Williamsburg and arrangement Dunmore a mortifying thrashing, yet progressively noticeable flag-bearers encouraging alert hindered his development, and in New Kent County, still some from Williamsburg, three of Henry's individual agents to Congress influenced him to leave off his walk. As Henry demanded the pioneers be redressed, an individual from the Governor's Council consented to pay the estimation of the powder by bill of trade.
