Ganesha pictures were pervasive in numerous pieces of India by the sixth century. The thirteenth century statue envisioned is run of the mill of Ganesha statuary from 900Ã¢ÂÂ 1200, after Ganesha had been entrenched as an autonomous god with his very own faction. This precedent highlights a portion of Ganesha's normal iconographic components. A for all intents and purposes indistinguishable statue has been dated between 973Ã¢ÂÂ 1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost, and another comparable statue is dated c.ÃÂ 12th century by Pratapaditya Pal. Ganesha has the leader of an elephant and a major stomach. This statue has four arms, which is basic in portrayals of Ganesha. He holds his very own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he tests with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The theme of Ganesha turning his trunk pointedly to one side to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is an especially obsolete component. An increasingly crude statue in one of the Ellora Caves with this general structure has been dated to the seventh century. Subtleties of different hands are hard to make out on the statue appeared. In the standard design, Ganesha regularly holds a hatchet or a prod in one upper arm and a pasha (noose) in the other upper arm. In uncommon examples, he might be portrayed with a human head.
