A second activity pursued on 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16 December. This foray was the commencement of a methodology received by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the administrator of the High Seas Fleet. Chief of naval operations von Ingenohl expected to utilize the battlecruisers of "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to strike British beach front towns so as to draw out parts of the Grand Fleet where they could be pulverized by the High Seas Fleet. Right off the bat 15 December the armada left port to attack the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That night, the German fight armada of eight pre-gunboats and twelve battleships, including "Oldenburg" and her three sisters, came to inside of a disengaged squadron of six British warships. Conflicts between the opponent destroyer screens in the dimness persuaded von Ingenohl that he was looked with the whole Grand Fleet, so von Ingenohl severed the commitment and turned the fight armada back toward Germany, compelled from Kaiser Wilhelm II to abstain from taking a chance with the armada pointlessly.
