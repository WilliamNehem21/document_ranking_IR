"Supernature" received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 27 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". In a review rated four out of five stars, "The Guardian" said that the album was "a brash, beautiful celebration of love and dancing". In a review for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand said that "[a]lthough "Supernature" lacks the imagination of "Felt Mountain" and the saucy brilliance of "Black Cherry", it doesn't pander to the pop crowd." Lauren Gitlin of "Rolling Stone" said the album was "[t]oxic and delicious" and that ""Supernature" will make you do bad thingsâand like it." However, Pitchfork Media reviewer Nitsuh Abebe was less impressed, and wrote that the album's songs "keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop." Michael Hubbard of musicOMH wrote a review for every song on "Supernature", and although he felt that it was a "curious, rather than classic, record", he criticised it for "fading out early on, with poor, low quality songs at the end which leave the listener feeling cheated". AllMusic critic Heather Phares called "Supernature" "Goldfrapp's most accessible album" and named "Ooh La La" as its best song.
