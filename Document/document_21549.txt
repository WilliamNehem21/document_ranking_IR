Late on the evening of 11 July, Hausser, the commander of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by "Leibstandarte" very difficult. The plan was for "Totenkopf" to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the KartashÑvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. "Leibstandarte" was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and "Das Reich" were to wait until "Totenkopf"s attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which "Leibstandarte" was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To "Leibstandarte"s right, elements of "Das Reich" were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, then turn south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources.
