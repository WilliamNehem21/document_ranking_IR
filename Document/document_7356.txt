Soegija was conceived in Surakarta, Dutch East Indies, to a Muslim retainer and his better half. The family moved to close-by Yogyakarta when Soegija was as yet youthful; there he started his instruction. Known as a brilliant kid, around 1909 he was asked by Father Frans van Lith to enter Xaverius College, a Jesuit school in Muntilan, where Soegija gradually wound up intrigued by Catholicism. He was submersed on 24ÃÂ December 1910. Subsequent to moving on from Xaverius in 1915 and going through a year as an educator there, Soegija went through two years at the on location theological school before setting off to the Netherlands in 1919. He started his two-year newcomer with the Society of Jesus in September 1920 in Grave, and completed his juniorate there in 1923. Following three years examining rationality at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch, he was sent back to Muntilan as an educator for a further two years. In 1928, he came back to the Netherlands to examine religious philosophy at Maastricht, where he was appointed by Bishop of Roermond Laurentius Schrijnen on 15ÃÂ August 1931; Soegija then included "pranata" to the back of his name. He was then sent back to the Indies to lecture and turned into a parochial vicar at the ward in Kidul Loji, Yogyakarta, and in 1934 he was given his very own area in Bintaran. There he concentrated on making a feeling of Catholicism inside the local network, underlining the requirement for solid securities between Catholic families. Soegijapranata was blessed as the vicar missional of the recently settled Apostolic Vicariate of Semarang in 1940.
