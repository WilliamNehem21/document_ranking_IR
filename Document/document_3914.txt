In the late spring of 1834 Balzac started to take a shot at a heartbreaking anecdote about a dad who is dismissed by his little girls. His diary records a few undated lines about the plot: "Subject of Old GoriotÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ A decent manÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ working class lodging-houseÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 600 fr. incomeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ having stripped himself exposed for his little girls who both have 50,000 fr. incomeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ kicking the bucket like a pooch." He composed the main draft of "Le PÃÂ¨re Goriot" in forty harvest time days; it was distributed as a sequential in the "Revue de Paris" among December and February. It was discharged as a novel in March 1835 by the distributing place of Werdet, who likewise distributed the second version in May. A much-changed third release was distributed in 1839 by Charpentier. Just like his custom, Balzac made overflowing notes and changes on verifications he got from distributers, with the goal that the later releases of his books were regularly fundamentally not the same as the most punctual. On account of "Le PÃÂ¨re Goriot", he changed some of the characters into people from different books he had composed, and included new passages loaded up with detail.
