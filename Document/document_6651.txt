At the point when the Korean War broke out on 25ÃÂ June 1950, No.ÃÂ 77 (Fighter) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was based at Iwakuni, Japan. For the past four years, furnished primarily with North American P-51 Mustangs, it had presented with the British Commonwealth Air Group, the air segment of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), at first as a component of No.ÃÂ 81 Wing RAAF. No.ÃÂ 81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948, leaving No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron as Australia's sole air unit in Japan. It was currently the biggest squadron in the RAAF, involving 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three CAC Wirraways, two Douglas C-47 Dakotas and two Austers. The squadron was getting ready to come back to Australia when it was set on backup for activity over Korea; it started flying missions as a component of the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping power seven days after the fact. No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron's leader, Wing Commander Lou Spence, was executed in real life on 9ÃÂ September 1950, and Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, Chief of Staff at BCOF, briefly assumed responsibility at Iwakuni, pending the arrangement of a general association for help and organization at the base. Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell touched base on 17ÃÂ September to expect order of No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron.
