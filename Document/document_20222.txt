In its natural state, the Colorado River poured about into the Gulf of California each year, amounting to an average flow rate of . Its flow regime was not at all steady â indeed, "prior to the construction of federal dams and reservoirs, the Colorado was a river of extremes like no other in the United States." Once, the river reached peaks of more than in the summer and low flows of less than in the winter annually. At Topock, Arizona, about upstream from the Gulf, a maximum historical discharge of was recorded in 1884 and a minimum of was recorded in 1935. In contrast, the regulated discharge rates on the lower Colorado River below Hoover Dam rarely exceed or drop below . Annual runoff volume has ranged from a high of in 1984 to a low of in 2002, although in most years only a small portion of this flow, if any, reaches the Gulf.
Between 85 and 90Â percent of the Colorado River's discharge originates in snowmelt, mostly from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. The three major upper tributaries of the Colorado â the Gunnison, Green, and San Juan â alone deliver almost per year to the main stem, mostly from snowmelt. The remaining 10 to 15Â percent comes from a variety of sources, principally groundwater base flow and summer monsoon storms. The latter often produces heavy, highly localized floods on lower tributaries of the river, but does not often contribute significant volumes of runoff. Most of the annual runoff in the basin occurs with the melting of Rocky Mountains snowpack, which begins in April and peaks during May and June before exhausting in late July or early August.
