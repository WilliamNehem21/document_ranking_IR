As the crusade advanced, apprehensions developed among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was excessively vain, obstinate, erratic and difficult to pursue their headings. Undoubtedly, Adams felt to a great extent let well enough alone for Washington's organization and did not see himself as a solid individual from the Federalist Party. He had commented that Hamilton's monetary program, revolved around banks, would "cheat" poor people and release the "gangrene of ravenousness." Desiring "a more malleable president than Adams," Hamilton moved to tip the decision to Pinckney. He forced South Carolina Federalist voters, vowed to vote in favor of "most loved child" Pinckney, to disperse their second votes among applicants other than Adams. Hamilton's plan was fixed when a few New England state voters knew about it and made a deal to avoid voting in favor of Pinckney. Adams composed not long after the race that Hamilton was a "pleased Spirited, prideful, hopeful Mortal continually professing to Morality, with as debased Morals as old Franklin who is a greater number of his Model than any one I know." Throughout his life, Adams owned exceedingly basic expressions about Hamilton. He made harsh references to his womanizing, genuine or claimed, and slurred him as the "Creole knave."
