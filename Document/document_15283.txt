"Armillaria luteobubalina" was first described in 1978 by mycologists Roy Watling and Glen Kile, who studied its effects on a fast-growing plantation of "Eucalyptus regnans" near Traralgon, Victoria. The plantation, established in 1963, consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about . A cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary pathogen, that is, one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other, secondary pathogens. This finding was inconsistent with the pathogenic behaviour of the known "Armillaria" species in Australia at the time, "A.Â mellea" and "A.Â elegans". Further study over the next few years showed that the fungus spread by the growth of underground mycelia in root systems, expanding outward from the initial infected stump at an average of per year. Most Australian records of "Armillaria" infections referred to "A.Â mellea", based on the presence of black rhizomorphs. For over one hundred years, "A.Â mellea" was thought to be a pleiomorphic (occurring in various distinct forms) species with a widespread distribution and host range, and variable pathogenicity. which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike. In 1973, Veikko Hintikka reported a technique to distinguish between "Armillaria" species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures. Using similar techniques, mycologists eventually determined that the "Armillaria mellea" species complex in Europe and North America in fact consisted of five and ten distinct "biological species", respectively.
