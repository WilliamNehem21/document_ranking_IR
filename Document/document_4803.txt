Benita Eisler, in 2000, contends that Giraud was one of a significant number of Byron's expected sexual victories. In spite of the fact that, as Eisler claims, Byron was at first unfit to achieve "that condition of aggregate and complete fulfillment" of a sexual association with Giraud, he kept in touch with Charles Matthews proclaiming that he would before long overcome any of the kid's outstanding hindrances. Amid Byron's sickness, Byron bragged to Hobhouse and Lady Melbourne that he kept on engaging in sexual relations with one such occurrence nearly causing his passing. Despite the fact that it is questionable, as indicated by Eisler, "Regardless of whether this surfeit of sensual satisfaction included just Nicolo as accomplice, he doesn't state. He was as yet sufficiently affectionate of the kid, yet his sexual fixation, with its orderly scorekeeping, appears to have run its course." Nigel Leask, in 2004, contends that Hobhouse would have objected to Byron's association with Giraud, and Fiona MacCarthy notes in her 2002 account that Lady Melbourne "would have comprehended his accomplice to be female". In a review of the different true to life conclusions and differences about Byron's connections, including Giraud, composed before 2004, Douglass calls attention to that "in spite of the more prominent conviction about his sexual irresoluteness, the precise idea of those connections stays subtle".
