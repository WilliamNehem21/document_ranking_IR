Eventually, he was disappointed with the Treaty of Ghent that finished the war. At the point when William Henry Harrison was being considered by Congress for the situation of general-in-boss in late 1813 and mid 1814, Desha restricted giving him the title since he guaranteed that Harrison had decided not to seek after British General Henry Procter following the Battle of the Thames and had just done as such after strenuous asking by Isaac Shelby.
