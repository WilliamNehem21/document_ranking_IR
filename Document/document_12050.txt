While concentrating under F.ÃÂ M. Cornford at Cambridge, Havelock started to scrutinize the got knowledge about the idea of pre-Socratic theory and, specifically, about its association with Socratic idea. In "The Literate Revolution in Greece", his penultimate book, Havelock was struck by a disparity between the language utilized by the rationalists he was examining and the intensely Platonic saying with which it was deciphered in the standard writings. It was notable that a portion of these philosophical writings (Parmenides, Empedocles) were composed in stanza as well as in the meter of Homer, who had as of late been distinguished (still dubiously at the time) by Milman Parry as an oral writer, however Cornford and different researchers of these early thinkers saw the training as a genuinely immaterial tradition left over from Hesiod. Havelock in the long run arrived at the resolution that the idyllic parts of early reasoning "were matters not of style but rather of substance," and that such scholars as Heraclitus and Empedocles really share more for all intents and purpose even on a scholarly dimension with Homer than they do with Plato and Aristotle. Be that as it may, he didn't freely part from Cornford until numerous years after the fact.
