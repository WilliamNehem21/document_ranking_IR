Subfossil stores and midden remains uncover that the huia was once across the board in both marsh and montane local backwoods all through the North Island, reaching out from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Just a couple huia are known from the broad entanglement stores in the karst of the Waitomo Caves zone and they are likewise uncommon or missing in fossil stores in the focal North Island and Hawke's Bay; it appears to have favored natural surroundings that are not very much examined by the stores known at present. The huia evaporated from the northern and western North Island following MÃÂori settlement in the fourteenth century, due to over-chasing, woodland leeway, and presented kiore going after homes. When of European settlement during the 1840s it was just discovered south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, over the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range reached out to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports gathered by Walter Buller and a solitary "waiata" (MÃÂori tune) recommend that the huia was once additionally found in the Marlborough and Nelson locale of the South Island; be that as it may, it has never been recognized in the rich fossil stores south of Cook Strait, and there is no other proof of the species' quality.
