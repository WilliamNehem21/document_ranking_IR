The main chronicles of Delius' works, in 1927, were directed by Beecham for the Columbia name: the "Stroll to the Paradise Garden" break from "A Village Romeo and Juliet", and "On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring", performed by the ensemble of the Royal Philharmonic Society. These started a long arrangement of Delius accounts under Beecham that proceeded for the remainder of the conductor's life. He was not the only one, nonetheless; Geoffrey Toye in 1929Ã¢ÂÂ 30 recorded "Brigg Fair", "In a Summer Garden", "Summer Night on the River" and the "Stroll to the Paradise Garden". Fenby describes that on his first day in Grez, Jelka played Beecham's "First Cuckoo" recording. In May 1934, when Delius was near death, Fenby played him Toye's "In a Summer Garden", the last music, Fenby says, that Delius at any point heard. Before the finish of the 1930s Beecham had issued forms for Columbia of the vast majority of the principle instrumental and choral works, together with a few melodies in which he went with the soprano Dora Labbette on the piano. By 1936 Columbia and HMV had issued accounts of Violin Sonatas 1 and 2, the "Requiem and Caprice", and of a portion of the shorter works.
