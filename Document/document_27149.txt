In JanuaryÂ 1998, the State Transportation Improvement Program approved a $245Â million allocation (about $ in dollars) for the expansion, and hopes were to finish construction by 2000, with traffic projected to decrease by 20Â percent on I-15. There were environmental concerns that fostered consideration of four northern alternatives. One of them was chosen in JuneÂ 1998 by the San Diego City Council, amid concerns that by moving the route away from "environmentally sensitive canyons", the freeway would be closer to residences. Some of those living in Rancho Glens Estates sued the city over these concerns in August.
Construction began on the missing portion of SRÂ 56 on OctoberÂ 21, 1999, amid allegations of a missing Army Corps of Engineers permit, at an estimated cost of $111Â million (about $ in dollars). The California Coastal Commission approved the extension on MayÂ 10, 2000, after residents lost two lawsuits relating to the proximity of the freeway. Caltrans was required to install a drainage system because of the wetlands; this requirement was similar to a court ruling for a project in the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. At this time, the completion was estimated to occur in 2004, at a cost of $151Â million (about $ in dollars). In OctoberÂ 2000, Carmel Valley Road was extended to Black Mountain Road, providing a paved alternative until SRÂ 56 was completed; commuters had to travel on a unpaved road, one of the only roads between I-5 and I-15 in North County.
