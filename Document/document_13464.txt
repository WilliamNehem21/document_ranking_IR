Matt Roush of "television Guide" called "CarnivÃÂ le" "the ideal show for the individuals who thought "Twin Peaks" was excessively open". "The Australian" said "CarnivÃÂ le" "appears to have been imagined in basically abstract terms" which "can now and then work on the page yet is fatal on the vast screen, not to mention a little one. It's practically similar to a scriptural directive against demand on TV." A commentator conceded his impulse to reject the primary period of "CarnivÃÂ le" as "too aesthetic and elusive" on the grounds that his absence of association kept him from comprehension "what the hell was going on, [which] can be an issue for a sensational TV arrangement." TV Zone anyway considered "CarnivÃÂ le" "an arrangement like no other and [...] the way that it is so open to understanding shockingly turns out to be one of its most noteworthy qualities." "CarnivÃÂ le" was praised for bringing "the misery of the Great Depression to life" and for being among the principal TV shows to demonstrate "unmitigated agony and dissatisfaction", yet analysts were not sure that watchers would discover the "gradually unfurling trouble" engaging over long or would have the tolerance or continuance to discover the significance of the show.
