"Lundomys molitor" is among the largest living oryzomyines, rivaled only by some large forms of "Holochilus" and "Nectomys", but it is substantially smaller than some of the recently extinct Antillean species, such as ""Ekbletomys hypenemus"" and "Megalomys desmarestii". Unlike in "Holochilus brasiliensis", which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body. It is sparsely haired and dark, and there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellowâbrown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts. The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous interdigital webbing, but they lack tufts of hair on the digits and several of the pads are reduced. As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, fringes of hair are present along the plantar margins and between some of the digits. The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines. The female has four pairs of teats, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of oryzomyines. The head and body length is , averaging , the tail length is 195 to 255Â mm (7.68 to 10.04Â mm), averaging , and the length of the hindfoot is , averaging .
