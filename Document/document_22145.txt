At the end of August 1941 production began on Formby's first film for Columbia, "South American George", which took six weeks to complete. Formby's move to an American company was controversial, and although his popular appeal seemed unaffected, his "films were treated with increasing critical hostility", according to John Mundy in his 2007 examination of British musical film. The reviewer for "The Times" wrote that the story was "confused" and considered that "there is not sufficient comic invention in the telling" of it. Murphy writes that the criticism "had more to do with the inadequate vehicles which he subsequently appeared in than in any diminution of his personal popularity."
In early 1942 Formby undertook a three-week, 72-show tour of Northern Ireland, largely playing to troops but also undertaking fund-raising shows for charityâone at the Belfast Hippodrome raised Â£500. He described his time in Ulster as "the pleasantest tour I've ever undertaken". He returned to the mainland by way of the Isle of Man, where he entertained the troops guarding the internment camps. After further charity showsâraising Â£8,000 for a tank fundâFormby was the associate producer for the Vera Lynn film "We'll Meet Again" (1943). In March he also filmed "Much Too Shy" which was released in October that year. Although the film was poorly received by the critics, the public still attended in large numbers, and the film was profitable.
