Firmly following "Triumph" as she went through the Franco-Spanish line over the bows of the French lead , Harvey was compelled to sheer away rapidly, simply missing "Victory"s stern. Swinging to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-firearm Spanish ship "SantÃÂ­sima Trinidad" and drew in her for twenty minutes, taking raking discharge from two French ships, the 80-weapon and the 74-weapon , as she did as such. "Redoutable"s broadside diverted "Temeraire"s mizzen topmast. While maintaining a strategic distance from a broadside from "Neptune", "Temeraire" barely evaded a crash with "Redoutable". Another broadside from "Neptune" cut down "Temeraire"s fore-yard and primary topmast, and harmed her fore pole and bowsprit. Harvey currently wound up mindful that "Redoutable" had come up close by "Triumph" and cleared her decks with black powder rifle discharge and projectiles. A substantial gathering of Frenchmen now accumulated on her decks prepared to board "Triumph". "Temeraire" was brought around; showing up all of a sudden out of the smoke of the fight and slipping crosswise over "Redoutable"s stern, "Temeraire" released a twofold shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques ÃÂtienne Lucas, skipper of "Redoutable", recorded that "...ÃÂ the three-decker ["Temeraire"]ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who had certainly seen that the "Triumph" had stopped shoot and would definitely be taken Ã¢ÂÂ ran foul of the "Redoutable" to starboard and overpowered us with the point-clear discharge of every one of her firearms. It is difficult to portray the awful butchery created by the deadly broadside of this ship. In excess of two hundred of our bold chaps were slaughtered or injured by it."
