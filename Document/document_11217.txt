Right off the bat in the main season the University of Toronto hockey group was in Boston for matches against neighborhood colleges. The group's administrator, Conn Smythe, who later claimed and dealt with the Toronto Maple Leafs, said that his group could without much of a stretch annihilation the BruinsÃ¢ÂÂRoss' group had won just two of their initial fifteen NHL diversions. This started a fight among Smythe and Ross which went on for more than 40 years, until Ross' passing; while generally bound to paper reports, they would not address each other at NHL Board of Governor gatherings. The Bruins completed their first season with six successes in thirty amusements, one of the most exceedingly terrible records ever of group. A few records were set through the span of the period; the three home successes are tied for the second least ever, and an eleven-diversion losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, outperformed in 2004 and now second longest ever.
