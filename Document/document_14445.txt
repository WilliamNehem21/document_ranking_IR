After fixes and an effective eastward intersection, "Princess Matoika" had an experience with an ice shelf off Newfoundland while conveying some 2,000ÃÂ Italian workers on her first return trip from Italy. The evening of 24ÃÂ February, the completely loaded ship struck what was accounted for in "The New York Times" as either "a chunk of ice or a submerged wreck" off Cape Race. The ship's controlling apparatus was harmed in the impact, leaving the ship loose for more than seven hours before fixes were affected. The "Matoika"s skipper demonstrated that no travelers were harmed in the crash. As per the tale of one second rate class traveler, she, suspecting there was something truly out of order, made request after the hullabaloo. A team part disclosed to her that the "Matoika" had just halted to welcome a ship going in the night. When she went on deck, tenacious on observing the other ship herself, she saw the ice sheet and watched the top of the line travelers lined up to board the effectively brought down rafts. She took her little girl with her to go along with one of the lines, and, however at first rebuked, was permitted to remain. The rafts were never sent, be that as it may, and the "Matoika" touched base in Boston, where she had been occupied because of a typhus alarm, on 28ÃÂ February moving forward without any more episode.
