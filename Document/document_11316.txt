It was not well before the Colorado River started to unleash destruction with its inconsistent streams. In harvest time, the stream would dip under the dimension of the trench channel, and transitory brush redirection dams must be built. In mid 1905, substantial floods wrecked the headworks of the channel, and water started to stream uncontrolled down the trench towards the Salton Sink. On August 9, the whole stream of the Colorado swerved into the trench and started to flood the base of the Imperial Valley. In a frantic bet to close the rupture, teams of the Southern Pacific Railroad, whose tracks went through the valley, endeavored to dam the Colorado over the channel, just to see their work destroyed by a blaze flood. It took seven endeavors, more than $3ÃÂ million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the government to for all time obstruct the break and send the Colorado on its regular course to the inlet Ã¢ÂÂ however not before part of the Imperial Valley was overflowed under a lake, the present Salton Sea. After the quick flooding danger passed, it was understood that an increasingly lasting arrangement would be expected to get control over the Colorado.
