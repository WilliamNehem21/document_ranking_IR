On 25 April 1920, the San Remo gathering Ã¢ÂÂ an outgrowth of the Paris Peace Conference gone to by the leaders of Britain, France and Italy, the , and the United States Ambassador to Italy Ã¢ÂÂ built up the essential terms for three League of Nations orders: a French command for Syria, and British orders for Mesopotamia and Palestine. Concerning Palestine, the goals expressed that the British were in charge of putting into impact the terms of the Balfour Declaration. The French and the Italians clarified their abhorrence of the "Zionist cast of the Palestinian order" and protested particularly to language that did not protect the "political" privileges of non-Jews, tolerating Curzon's case that "in the British language every single conventional right were incorporated into "social liberties"". In line with France, it was concurred that an endeavor was to be embedded in the command's procÃÂ¨s-verbal this would not include the surrender of the rights until now delighted in by the non-Jewish people group in Palestine. The limits of Palestine were left unspecified, to "be controlled by the Principal Allied Powers." after three months, in July 1920, the French annihilation of Faisal's Arab Kingdom of Syria encouraged the British need to know "what is the 'Syria' for which the French got an order at San Remo?" and "does it incorporate Transjordania?" Ã¢ÂÂ it hence chose to seek after a strategy of partner Transjordan with the commanded region of Palestine without adding it to the territory of the Jewish National Home.
