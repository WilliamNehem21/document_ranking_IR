His 2003 takeoff was his longest nonappearance from "OLTL; "he didn't come back to the arrangement until 2011. Todd was recast in 2003 with St. John, and Howarth joined "As the World Turns" as Paul Ryan until it was dropped in 2010. Malone expressed that in light of Todd's allure, which he credited to Howarth, "The system was in this way cheerful to have him come back to Llanview at whatever point Roger would return, and glad to have him move into story in significant ways." In April 2011, following a while of hypothesis, "OLTL" affirmed Howarth's arrival, despite the fact that it was vague in the event that he would depict Todd Manning. He expressed, "I am anticipating coming back to "One Life to Live"". Official maker Frank Valentini stated, "We are excited to have Roger come back to "One Life to Live"". It was in the end uncovered that St. John's form of the character was truly Victor Lord, Jr., Todd's twin sibling, molded to trust that he was Todd and expect Todd's personality, while the genuine Todd (Howarth) was held prisoner for a long time.
