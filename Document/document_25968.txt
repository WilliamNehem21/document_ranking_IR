Sampson had continued his studies of the material since 1989. In 1994, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he named "Taxon C" as a new genus and species, "Achelousaurus horneri". Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, it did not identify a holotype, a name-bearing specimen. In 1995, in a subsequent article, Sampson indicated specimen MOR 485 as the holotype specimen of "Achelousaurus horneri". The generic name consists of the words "Achelous", the name of a Greek mythological figure, and "saurus", which is Latinized Greek for lizard. Achelous (á¼ÏÎµÎ»á¿·Î¿Ï) is a Greek river deity and a shapeshifter who was able to transform himself into anything. During a fight with Hercules, the mythical hero, Achelous took the form of a bull, but lost the battle when one of his horns was removed. This allusion is a reference to the supposedly transitional traits of the dinosaur and the characteristic loss of horns through ontogenetic and phylogenetic development, and thus through individual change and evolution. Dodson, in 1996, praised the generic name for being original and intelligent. The specific name honors Jack Horner, for his research on the dinosaurs of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. Sampson also named "Taxon B" as the genus "Einiosaurus" in the same article wherein "Achelousaurus" was described. He stated that paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation (i.e., variation within a species) might be mistaken for interspecific differences (between species). Until 1995, only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since "Pachyrhinosaurus" in 1950, namely "Avaceratops" in 1986. "Achelousaurus" thus holds particular importance for being one of the few ceratopsid genera named in the late twentieth century.
