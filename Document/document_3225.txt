First occupied for a brief period in the second 50% of the fourth thousand years BC, it was repopulated around 2800 BC and kept on developing. By 2000 BC, it turned into the capital of a local kingdom that spread its position over substantial swathes of the focal and southern Levant. The kingdom delighted in great relations with Mari, yet was occupied with steady fighting against Yamhad. By the fifteenth century BC, Qatna lost its authority and went under the specialist of Mitanni. It later changed hands between the previous and Egypt, until it was vanquished and sacked by the Hittites in the late fourteenth century BC. Following its demolition, the city was diminished in size before being deserted by the thirteenth century BC. It was resettled in the tenth century BC, turning into a focal point of the kingdoms of Palistin then Hamath until it was pulverized by the Assyrians in 720 BC, which diminished it to a little town that in the long run vanished in the sixth century BC. In the nineteenth century AD, the site was populated by townspeople who were emptied into the recently assembled town of al-Mishrifeh in 1982. The site has been unearthed since the 1920s.
