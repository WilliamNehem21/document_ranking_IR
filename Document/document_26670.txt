"Indefatigable" remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by "Inflexible" on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta for a refit; she then sailed to England on 14 February and joined the 2nd BCS upon her arrival. The ship conducted uneventful patrols of the North Sea for the next year and a half.
