The French government affirmed its rights to infringe on Edward's legitimate rights in Gascony. Protection from one judgment in Saint-Sardos brought about Charles IV announcing the duchy relinquish. Charles' sister, Queen Isabella, was sent to arrange and concurred a settlement that expected Edward to pay reverence in France to Charles. Edward surrendered Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his child Edward, who made a trip to France to give reverence in his stead. With the English beneficiary in her capacity, Isabella wouldn't come back to England except if Edward II rejected his top picks, and she turned into the fancy woman of Roger Mortimer. The couple attacked England and, with Henry, third Earl of Lancaster, caught the ruler. Edward II relinquished on condition that his child would acquire the position of royalty as opposed to Mortimer. Despite the fact that there is no verifiable record of the reason for death, he is famously accepted to have been killed at Berkeley Castle by having an intensely hot poker pushed into his guts. An overthrow by Edward III finished four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed. In spite of the fact that expelled from power, Isabella was dealt with well, and lived in extravagance for the following 27 years.
