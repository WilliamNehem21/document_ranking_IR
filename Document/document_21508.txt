U2 developed a style of editing in their previous concert films that involved fast cutting between shots, which Owens wanted to retain in "U2 3D". Because fast cutting in 3D would lead to motion sickness or eye strain, the film was edited to incorporate dissolves of at least four frames between shots. Many of the transitions were created by layering several frames of footage on top of one another into composite images. Each of the layered frames featured a different depth of field to enhance the 3D effects, and up to five images were layered together in a single shot. This made "U2 3D" the first 3D film to feature composite images with more than two layers, and the first to be edited specifically to prevent the viewer from experiencing motion sickness or eye strain. Software did not exist at the time to layer the 3D images, so new software had to be developed. Because the project was captured in high-definition video, each frame used nearly 20 megabytes of data on 3ality Digital's servers, and the entire film used almost a petabyte (10 bytes). The 3D editing process took longer than Owens expected, and consequently, the project went over budget, costing $15Â million to produce. Video editing took 17Â months, and the final film was cut to a length of 85Â minutesâseven shorter than originally announced.
