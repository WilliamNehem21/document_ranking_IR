Upon "Eraserhead" release, "Variety" offered a negative review, calling it "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing "Eraserhead" to Lynch's next film "The Elephant Man", Tom Buckley of "The New York Times" felt that while the latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called "Eraserhead" "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from the appearance of the deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of "The Atlantic" felt that "Eraserhead" demonstrated that Lynch was "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis BuÃ±uel's 1929 work "Un Chien Andalou" or 1930's "L'Age d'Or", Lynch's imagery "isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the "Chicago Tribune", Michael Wilmington described "Eraserhead" as unique, feeling that the film's "intensity" and "nightmare clarity" were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay "Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks", critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that "Eraserhead" represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with "Wild at Heart"âLynch's most recent feature film at that timeâsaying "even the most cursory comparison of "Eraserhead" with "Wild at Heart" reveals an artistic decline so precipitous that it is hard to imagine the same person making both films".
