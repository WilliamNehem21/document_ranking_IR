The decision of entombment place was representative. Victoria Thompson contends that if ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d had picked Edward's illustrious tomb in Winchester as the internment place for her significant other and herself, that would have underscored Mercia's subordinate status, though a customary Mercian regal entombment spot, for example, Repton would have been a provocative affirmation of autonomy; Gloucester, close to the outskirt with Wessex, was a trade off between the two. Martin Ryan sees the establishment as "something like an illustrious tomb, expected to supplant the one at Repton (Derbyshire) that had been obliterated by the Vikings". ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d kicked the bucket a couple of months too soon to see the last triumph of the southern Danelaw by Edward. She was prevailing as Lady of the Mercians by her little girl, ÃÂlfwynn, yet toward the beginning of December 918 Edward ousted her and took Mercia under his control. Numerous Mercians hated the subjection of their old kingdom to Wessex, and Wainwright depicts the Mercian annalist's portrayal of the affidavit of ÃÂlfwynn as "overwhelming with disdain". Edward kicked the bucket in 924 at Farndon in Cheshire a couple of days in the wake of putting down a resistance by Mercians and Welshmen at Chester.
