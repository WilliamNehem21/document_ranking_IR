The species all in all isn't considered especially powerless against these components, be that as it may, for what it's worth so broadly appropriated and normal. Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation does not believe it to be uncommon, and has excluded it on their Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. It in any case has high protection significance in something like one setting: it is a cornerstone mutualist in the Avon Wheatbelt, where it is the main wellspring of nectar amid a basic time of the year when no other nectar-creating plant is in blossom. The loss of "B.ÃÂ prionotes" from the area would hence mean the loss of all the honeyeaters too, and this would influence the numerous different types of plants that depend on honeyeaters for fertilization. The essential vegetation network in which "Banksia prionotes" happens in the Avon Wheatbelt is viewed as a need environmental network, and is proposed for formal gazetting as an undermined natural network under the name ""Banksia prionotes" and "Xylomelum angustifolium" low forests on transported yellow sand". Albeit as of now in close perfect and static condition, it is considered in danger because of a substantial number of compromising procedures, including land clearing, scene discontinuity, rising soil saltiness, brushing weight, rivalry with weeds, changes to the flame routine, junk dumping, and "P.ÃÂ cinnamomi" dieback.
