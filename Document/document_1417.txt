The Prince sent his troops in two lines, the conservative at his northernmost point, moored at Nippern. Leuthen filled in as the Austrian focus. Charles built up his direction post there, utilizing a congregation tower as his perception post, and positioning seven regiments in the town itself. Most of Charles' powers remained on his conservative. A little propelled post remained at Borna, yet with Frederick's landing in power, they pulled back promptly toward the east. The Austrian position converged at right edges with the primary street among Borna and Breslau, going through Frobelwitz and Lissa. He verified Nippern with eight grenadier organizations and put his rangers at Guckerwitz (present-day ). The Austrian line stretched out as far south as SagschÃÂ¼tz (present-day Zakrzyce). There, his mounted force remained at right edges to the infantry, making a line among SagschÃÂ¼tz and Gahla. The positions were verified with extra grenadiers and pickets. Troops filled towns and woods, and hurriedly made abatis and redoubts. Pickets protected all correspondence focuses just as street and way intersections. The left wing was his most limited, with mounted force set at the far end, close to a stream by the town of Gahla.
