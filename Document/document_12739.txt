The challenge at first just included the criterium being neutralizedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that is, the race executive concurred that every rider would get a similar completing time as the stage victor paying little respect to when they really went too far. After the riders rode a lap of the course, they chose rather not to challenge the phase by any stretch of the imagination, riding the initial six circuits slower than past stages. After four laps, they ceased by and large as race pioneer Di Luca tended to the despondent group to clarify their activities. The occasions for the stage did not tally, and there was no forceful riding until a last run completion. Alongside Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was viewed as the central voice representing the peloton on this day. Despite the fact that the dissent was alluded to by some as "consistent," cyclists, for example, Filippo Pozzato, who was himself bearing wounds supported in an accident that would later drive him out the race, said the riders had been excessively rushed in their choice, and that it ought to have been made convincingly before the stage started. Armstrong apologized to the fans for the impact the dissent had on what should be a fantastic exhibition, yet in addition battled that it was the right choice for the peloton to make.
