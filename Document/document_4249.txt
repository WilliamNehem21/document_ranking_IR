Their records have been vigorously impacted by the "motorik" system of 1970s krautrock gatherings, for example, Neu! what's more, Faust. Tim Gane has bolstered the correlation: "Neu! did moderation and automatons, however in an exceptionally pop manner." Dave Heaton of "PopMatters" said that their music likewise had "echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova", with their prior work "bearing solid Velvet Underground hints". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were extra motivations for the band. Stephan Davet of French paper "Le Monde" said that "Head Tomato Ketchup" (1996) had melodic impacts, for example, Burt Bacharach, and FranÃÂ§oise Hardy. The sounds affected by moderate arrangers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 collection "Cobra and Phases GroupÃÂ Play Voltage in the Milky Night." a similar collection, as per Rick Reger of "Chicago Tribune", "diagrams [a course] somewhere close to the Beach Boys and Kraftwerk." Stereolab's style additionally fuses simple listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Barney Hoskyns wrote in an audit for "Spots and Loops" (1997) that the gathering moved "far from the one-harmony Velvets ramble work of its initial days" toward simple tuning in and Europop. Joshua Klein in "Washington Post" said that, "prior years every other person got on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German groups Can and Neu!, the Mexican parlor music ace Esquivel and the strongly unhip Burt Bacharach." Regarding their later work, for example, "Moment 0 in the Universe" (2003) and "Margerine Eclipse" (2004), commentators have contrasted the discharges with the band's prior guitar-driven style.
