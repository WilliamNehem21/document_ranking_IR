The cash approved for maritime extension in 1905 was diverted to building three battleships (with the third to be set down after the first was propelled), three scout cruisers (later diminished to two, which turned into the ), fifteen destroyers (later decreased to ten, the ), three submarines (the "F 1" class), and two submarine tenders (later decreased to one, ). This move was made with the extensive scale backing of Brazilian government officials, including Pinheiro Machado and an almost consistent vote in the Senate; the naval force, presently with a huge ship advocate, Rear Admiral , in the persuasive post of clergyman of the naval force; and the Brazilian press. All things considered, these progressions were made with the stipulation that the all out cost of the new maritime program not surpass as far as possible, so the expansion in ship tonnage was purchased with the past end of protected cruisers and diminishing the quantity of destroyer-type warships. The three war vessels on which development had started were rejected start on 7 January 1907, and the plan for the new battleships was affirmed on 20 February. Papers started covering the Brazilian warship request in March, and Armstrong set out the primary man of war on 17 April. The full requestÃ¢ÂÂincluding each of the three gunboats and the two cruisersÃ¢ÂÂwas accounted for by the "New York Herald", "Day by day Chronicle", and the "Times" soon thereafter.
