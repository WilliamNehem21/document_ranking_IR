Since 1925 there have been six arrangement printed, with the plan continuing as before until 1980, however the shading and watermarks have changed. The Irish word "pingin", for penny, is utilized in both ÃÂ£.s.d and decimal money, but since it has a similar significance in each, the incentive on the name does not demonstrate whether the mark was issued previously or after decimalisation.

For instance, the 3d esteem was blue somewhere in the range of 1940 and 1969, and stone shading from 1971 until 1980; it transformed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Moreover, the 1, 5 and 8 pence qualities are found in two unique hues relying upon the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark assortments. With the exception of the 6th issue, which has the word ÃÂire in the structure, there is no unequivocal nation character on any of the others. The initial four arrangement utilize just Irish words.
