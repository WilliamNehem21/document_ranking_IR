"Pathways" was a basic achievement. Inside Mac Games analyst Jon Blum wrote in 1993 that "Pathways" was "a standout amongst the best Macintosh diversions I've at any point played". "PC Gaming World" portrayed "Pathways" as "a cell creep, unadulterated and straightforward". While depicting the diversion before acquiring a firearm as "dreary" and scrutinizing the modest number of spare focuses per level, the magazine adulated the "straightforward, exquisite and simple to utilize" UI and "magnificent" illustrations and sound. "PC Gaming World" inferred that while "to some degree powerless on genuine amusement play", "Pathways" was "an occupation deserving of a solid suggestion". "Macworld"s Steven Levy remarked that the ongoing interaction and designs were very smooth. He singled out the animals for explicit acclaim, comparing them to "something that may have originated from a mind converge of Tim Burton, Anne Rice and Hieronymus Bosch" rather than basic line illustrations. Grumblings and reactions of the amusement incorporated the trouble level; Blum discovered a few sections excessively troublesome and that it was conceivable to invest hours playing before understanding that the player had committed an irreversible error. Jones conceded that the amusement was more diligently than he planned. The title got a few honors, including Inside Mac Games' "Experience Game of the Year" and "Macworld"s "Best Role-Playing Game", and was recorded on the "MacUser" 100.
