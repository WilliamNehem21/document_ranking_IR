The fight on Malvern Hill was a reverberating Union strategic triumph. The triumph was expected in no little part to Henry Hunt, the Union boss artillerist, who did capable work in amassing and focusing the Union weapons. Troop situation before the fight by the military's primary geographical specialist, Col. A. A. Humphreys, was likewise done competently. The ground on Malvern Hill was utilized viably and the Union line had profundity with a sound measure of rested troops accessible to guard it. Fitz John Porter, the true administrator throughout the afternoon, assumed a vital job in this. He posted his men well on June30, and positioned fortifications close to the Union line. Darius Couch, whose powers involved portion of the Union focus, situated his fortifications skilfully too and coordinated with George Morell, whose units shaped the other piece of the Union center. The infantrymen performed well too. As Brian K. Burton notes, "[the infantrymen] remained behind the firearms more often than not and did not progress excessively far amid countercharges. This conduct permitted the heavy armament specialists an unmistakable field of flame." Furthermore, if a greater amount of anything was required, infantry or cannons, it was accessible. At the cutting edge of the Union triumph, notwithstanding, was the mind-boggling capability of their big guns, as later records by officers from the two militaries more than once bore witness to.
