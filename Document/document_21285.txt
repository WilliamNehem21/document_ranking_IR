The "retiarius" held the dagger in his left hand. The gladiator could use the dagger to cut his net free if it got snagged on his trident. He might fight with the trident in one hand and the dagger in the other, but this negated the advantage of distance afforded by the longer weapon when wielded by itself. The dagger also served as a backup should the "retiarius" lose both net and trident. He attacked with the dagger when he had the element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle the "secutor" to the ground. Fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations, perhaps with daggers. Should the "retiarius" win and be ordered to kill his rival, he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat. Evidence shows that "retiarii" could be quite successful combatants; a tombstone from Gaul reads, "[For] the "retiarius", L. Pompeius, winner of nine crowns, born in Vienna, twenty-five years of age. His wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse." Nevertheless, the gladiators themselves were prone to boast: A graffito at Pompeii shows the "retiarius" Antigonus, who claims a ridiculous 2,112Â victories, facing a challenger called Superbus, who has won but a single fight.
