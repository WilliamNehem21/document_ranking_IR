In June 1941, soon after the initiation of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler announced that the "Waffen-SS" could select outsiders for administration on the Eastern Front. He needed an army to be raised from every one of the involved nations of Western Europe, however Himmler was just keen on enlisting "Germanic" individuals into the "Waffen-SS". Himmler chose that there were substantial quantities of potential expert German yet nationalistic enlisted people accessible from the "Germanic" races in involved nations, and coordinated Berger to investigate this labor source. Because of Himmler's choice, the Wehrmacht was allowed to enlist Frenchmen, Spaniards and Croats, while Dutch, Flemish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish men were Berger's area. The "national armies" each numbered 1,000, with the exception of the Netherlands Legion, which had a most extreme quality of 2,000. In November 1941, the Netherlands Legion and Flemish Legion had finished light infantry preparing and were sent to join the second SS Infantry Brigade on the Leningrad Front. While they swore an individual vow to Hitler and were liable to SS tenets and guidelines, they were not individuals from the SS, and wore national images instead of the sig runes. Berger even ventured to such an extreme as to prescribe to Himmler that Flemings never again be treated as outsiders, however be given full citizenship rights as Germans.
