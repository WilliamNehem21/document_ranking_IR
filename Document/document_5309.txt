A few Russian animal groups, in light of inadequately protected vertebral remains, were alluded to "Elasmosaurus" by N.N. Bogolubov in 1911. One was "E.helmerseni", which was first depicted by W.Kiprijanoff in 1882 from Maloje Serdoba, Saratov, as "Plesiosaurus helmerseni". Some material from Scania, Sweden, was alluded to "helmerseni" in 1885 by H.SchrÃÂ¶der. Vertebral and appendage stays from Kursk at first alluded by Kiprijanoff to "P.helmerseni" were likewise moved by Bogolubov to the new species "E.kurskensis", which he viewed as "indistinguishable with "Elasmosaurus" or identified with it". He additionally named "E.orskensis", in light of "extremely extensive" neck and tail vertebra stays from Konopljanka, Orenburg; and "E.serdobensis", in view of a solitary neck vertebra from Maloje Serdoba. Nonetheless, the legitimacy of these species has been addressed. Welles considered "E.kurskensis" as an uncertain plesiosaur in 1962. Persson noted in a 1959 survey of the Swedish ""E."helmerseni" material that, while the species was presumably firmly identified with "Elasmosaurus" appropriate, it was unreasonably fragmentary for this theory to be evaluated; he later commented in 1963 that, in regards to the last three species, "their nonexclusive and explicit definition is flawed", in spite of the fact that he declined to explicitly mark them as invalid by virtue of not having seen the fossil material. Also, in 1999, Evgeniy Pervushov, Maxim Arkhangelsky, and A.V. Ivanov considered "E.helmerseni" to be a vague elasmosaurid. In 2000 Storrs, Archangelsky, and Vladimir Efimov agreed with Welles on "E.kurskensis", and marked "E.orskensis" and "E.serdobensis" as uncertain elasmosaurids.
