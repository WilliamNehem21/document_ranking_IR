Residencies in Italy were allowed by rivalry (") for an empty seat, the candidates being appraised on their distributions by a council of teachers. Fermi connected for a seat of scientific material science at the University of Cagliari on Sardinia, yet was barely ignored for Giovanni Giorgi. In 1926, at 24 years old, he connected for a residency at the Sapienza University of Rome. This was another seat, one of the initial three in hypothetical material science in Italy, that had been made by the Minister of Education at the encouraging of Professor Orso Mario Corbino, who was the University's educator of test physical science, the Director of the Institute of Physics, and an individual from Benito Mussolini's bureau. Corbino, who additionally led the determination council, trusted that the new seat would raise the standard and notoriety of material science in Italy. The advisory group picked Fermi in front of Enrico Persico and Aldo Pontremoli, and Corbino helped Fermi select his group, which was before long joined by remarkable understudies, for example, Edoardo Amaldi, Bruno Pontecorvo, Ettore Majorana and Emilio SegrÃÂ¨, and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had designated as his collaborator. They were before long nicknamed the "Through Panisperna young men" after the road where the Institute of Physics was found.
