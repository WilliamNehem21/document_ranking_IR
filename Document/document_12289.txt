Sarah Rodman, composing for "The Boston Globe", named "Single Ladies" the fourth most compelling melody of the decade, and expressed, "[BeyoncÃÂ©] joined leotards with coarse commitment bling bedeviling into one delectable attractive yet-outdated bundle. The video had the entire world moving and waving along by means of YouTube." VH1 positioned "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its rundown of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book "Eating the Dinosaur" (2009), Chuck Klosterman composed that "Solitary Ladies" is "ostensibly the main tune obviously advertised toward urban lone rangeress parties". Jody Rosen of "The New Yorker" credited the songs that buoy and dart over the pound for making another sound in music that didn't exist on the planet before BeyoncÃÂ©. He further expressed, "On the off chance that they sound 'typical' presently, this is on the grounds that BeyoncÃÂ©, and her numerous adherents, have retrained our ears."
