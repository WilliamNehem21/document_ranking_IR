Canning's genuineness (or absence of it) and Fielding's treatment of the case were brought up in a profoundly basic assault printed by "The London Daily Advertiser". Around the same time that Gascoyne requested Canning's capture a commercial showed up in the "Open Advertiser", asking its perusers "to suspend their judgment on account of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the entire, which is presently being set up by Mr. Handling, is distributed." Fielding had scholarly of Hall's scrutinizing by Gascoyne and had conveyed Canning to his home in Bow Street, to "filter reality out of her, and to convey her to admission on the off chance that she was blameworthy." Satisfied with her record, and unconcerned with Hall, his investigate of Squires' supporters was distributed as "A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning", in which he upheld the ethical idea of the youthful house cleaner and assaulted those her spoilers. Duplicates sold so rapidly that a second print run was requested two days after the fact. John Hill saw "A Clear Statement" as an immediate assault on Gascoyne, and shot Fielding with "The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered", which derided his foe with so much remarks as: "Sir's identity, you, that are in this way directing unto the Government? Resign into yourself and know your station." Fielding, notwithstanding, had little impact in the adventure from subsequently, trusting that Canning's supporters had started to consider him to be an impediment to their case.
