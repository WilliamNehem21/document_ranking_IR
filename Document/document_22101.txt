At the time, Acclaim Entertainment was in financial jeopardy. The company was a major publisher in the 16 bit era of games, but the company's sales suffered as it was slow to migrate from older game systems like the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System to next-generation platforms. The company lost $222 million in the 1996 fiscal year due to sales falling to $162 million compared to $567 million the previous year; in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, the company lost a further $19 million. The company laid off 100 of its 950 workers since March 1996 and its stock had dropped from a high of $13.875 a share to as low as $3. "Turok", Acclaim's first Nintendo 64 title, became the company's best hope of a turnaround, as there were only ten Nintendo 64 games on the market, and "Turok" was the only shooter. "Turok" was the only major Nintendo 64 software demonstrated at the September 1996 European Computer Trade Show, with Nintendo themselves absent from the show. Alex. Brown Inc analysts figured that selling one million copies of "Turok" could bring Acclaim as much as $45 million. Due to cash flow issues, much of the money planned for marketing "Turok" was contingent on strong sales of "". Endangering "Turok"s sales was its high priceâ$79.99 in the US, Â£70 in the UK, and $129.95 in Australiaâand Entertainment Software Rating Board's "mature" rating, which suggested lower sales as parents would not buy the game for their children.
