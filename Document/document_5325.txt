Estimating long, the western jackdaw is the second littlest individual from the family "Corvus". A large portion of the plumage is a gleaming dark, with a purple (in subspecies "monedula" and "spermologus") or blue (in subspecies "cirtensis" and "soemmerringii") sheen on the crown, brow, and secondaries, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, primaries, and tail. The cheeks, scruff and neck are light dim to grayish-silver, and the underparts are slate-dim. The legs are dark, similar to the short hefty bill, the length of which is about 75% of the length of the remainder of the head. There are rictal bristles covering around 40% of the maxilla and 25% of the lower mandible. The irises of grown-ups are grayish or gleaming white while those of adolescents are light blue, getting to be earthy before brightening at around one year of age. The genders resemble the other alike, however the head and neck plumage of male winged animals blurs more with age and wear, especially just before shedding. Western jackdaws experience a total shed from June to September in the western pieces of their range, and after a month in the east. The purplish sheen of the top is most unmistakable soon after shedding.
