Van Eyck marked, dated and added his saying to the focal board, a reality possibly found when the edge was evacuated over the span of a mid-twentieth century reclamation, and affirmed with the 1959 disclosure of the mark which is set alongside the words "" ("Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437. As I Can"). "Completed" ("complevit") may propose the fulfillment date, yet as ace painters of the time regularly had workshops to help on real works, the wording can be viewed as forcefully socially driven; maybe a presumptuous ace painter demonstrating his workshop associates had minimal material inclusion in the boards, and that he was basically in charge of its plan and execution. This view is strengthened by the way that it is the main non-representation to contain van Eyck's saying, "". Until the revelation of the mark the piece was differently dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s. Since the boards are so certainly ascribed they are frequently utilized as a touchstone to date van Eyck's different works; there are various obvious expressive improvements, including the sort of recolored glass windows and moldings around the arcades, and his capacity at dealing with point of view, which can be utilized to decide whether different works at any rate pre-date the triptych.
