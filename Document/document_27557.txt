On 14 March 1915, "Preussen" went to Kiel for periodic maintenance, and she was replaced as the squadron flagship by the battleship . The latter vessel held the position for the remainder of the squadron's existence, with the exceptions of 19 September to 16 October 1915, 25 February to 7 April 1916, in September that year, and from 22 January to 10 February 1917; during each of these periods, "Preussen" temporarily resumed the flagship role. Starting in April 1916, the ships of II Squadron were tasked with patrolling the Danish straits; each ship of the squadron was to rotate through the duty, the others remaining in the Elbe or serving with the main fleet. "Preussen" began her first stint on 21 April, replacing "Hessen"; she was accordingly absent during the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft three days later. On 4 May, "Preussen" was relieved and she returned to the Elbe, though she was transferred back to the straits on 21 May, remaining there until 8 June. As a result, she missed the Battle of Jutland, fought on 31 May â 1 June in the North Sea. Her sister ship "Lothringen" also missed the battle, as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in the fleet sortie.
