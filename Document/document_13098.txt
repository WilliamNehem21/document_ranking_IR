The corolla flares open into five projections, two upper flaps and three lower projections. The upper projections are 7Ã¢ÂÂ 16ÃÂ millimeters (ÃÂ¼Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ in.) long by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 9ÃÂ millimeters (Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ in.) wide and for the most part oval, obovate, or cuneate. The lower flaps are also molded and are 7Ã¢ÂÂ 20ÃÂ millimeters (ÃÂ¼Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ¾ÃÂ in.) long by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 18ÃÂ millimeters (Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ¾ÃÂ in.) wide. The focal lower flap is generally marginally longer than its neighbors. The majority of the petal flaps have adjusted finishes. The botanical cylinder that houses the conceptive organs and is unmistakable at the base of corolla flaps is white or lilac in shading and 4Ã¢ÂÂ 6ÃÂ millimeters (Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ¼ÃÂ in.) long. The white shade of the botanical cylinder can reach out to a variable separation onto the corolla flaps, especially in a stripe on the lower center projection. The shade of the corolla flaps for the most part shifts from pink to purple, however has been depicted by authorities as being "purple, red, blushing lavender to pale blue purple, dim pink to lavender, pinkish-purple, profound violet-purple, dull purple, splendid mauve-pink, brilliant purple-pink, maroon with [white eye], [and] ruddy pale with white eye."
