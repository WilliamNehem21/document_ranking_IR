Broad timber cutting in the Sandy River bowl started in the mid-19thÃÂ century in light of an interest for wood from the Portland metropolitan zone. Logging escalated in the lower bowl through the 20thÃÂ century as sawmills ended up built up in Sandy, Boring, Brightwood and different settlements in the district, and railroad goads stretched out into the timberlands. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt marked into law the Bull Run Trespass Act to prohibit exercises, for example, outdoors and animals brushing in the Bull Run Reserve. With the exception of movement identified with the waterworks, the secured zone changed little until the 1950s, when the United States Forest Service started to advocate signing in the Reserve. After the U.S. Congress passed the Multiple Use Ã¢ÂÂ Sustained Yield Act of 1960 focusing on timber creation in the national woods, the Forest Service during the 1970s worked about of timberland streets in the watershed. Before the street building and overwhelming logging, "The watershed [had] remained practically sacred for almost 60ÃÂ years, its overflow ensured by a to a great extent solid scope of hundreds of years old trees," as per an individual from the Bull Run Advisory Committee, a logical board dispatched by the City of Portland in 1977 to survey issues identified with Bull Run.
