Griswold continued editing and contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22Â months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with "The International Magazine". There, he worked with contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of "The Criterion", Griswold anonymously reviewed the first edition of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass", declaring: "It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of "the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license", a "degrading, beastly sensuality." Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left "this gathering of muck to the laws whichÂ ... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity." Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of "Leaves of Grass". He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to "that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.
