Another critical scene concerns mutilations that the soldiers cause upon one another: Horus harms or takes Set's balls and Set harms or detaches one, or once in a while both, of Horus' eyes. Now and again the eye is attacked pieces. Set's mutilation connotes lost virility and quality. The evacuation of Horus' eye is significantly progressively imperative, for this stolen Eye of Horus speaks to a wide assortment of ideas in Egyptian religion. One of Horus' significant jobs is as a sky divinity, and hence his correct eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The burglary or demolition of the Eye of Horus is accordingly likened with the obscuring of the moon over the span of its cycle of stages, or amid shrouds. Horus may reclaim his lost Eye, or different divinities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may recover or recuperate it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde contends that the custom about the lost balls is a late minor departure from Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like circle that rises up out of Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. Assuming this is the case, the scenes of mutilation and sexual maltreatment would frame a solitary story, in which Set attacks Horus and loses semen to him, Horus strikes back and impregnates Set, and Set comes into ownership of Horus' Eye when it shows up on Set's head. Since Thoth is a moon divinity notwithstanding his different capacities, it would bode well, as per te Velde, for Thoth to develop as the Eye and venture in to intercede between the quarreling gods.
