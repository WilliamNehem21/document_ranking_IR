Scott discussed a continuation of the series in March 2012, saying that "Prometheus" leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that "Prometheus" could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. By August 2012, a sequel was announced to be in development for release no earlier than 2014. Lindelof chose not to work on the new film, citing other commitments. Titled "", the sequel premiered in London, England on May 4, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017. Set eleven years after the events of "Prometheus", "Alien: Covenant"s story follows the crew of the Covenant space ship who land on an uncharted and seemingly uninhabited planet. The film stars Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Jussie Smollett, Amy Seimetz, Carmen Ejogo, Callie Hernandez, Alex England and Billy Crudup. On release, "Alien: Covenant" earned a worldwide box office gross of $240.7 million (compared to "Prometheus" $403.4 million), and received generally favorable reviews. A sequel to "Alien: Covenant" is in development. In 2013, a comic book series was announced by Dark Horse Comics that serves as a spin-off to "Prometheus". The series, titled "Fire and Stone", is an "Alien vs. Predator" crossover featuring content exclusive to "Prometheus". The first issue of "Fire and Stone" was released on September 10, 2014.
