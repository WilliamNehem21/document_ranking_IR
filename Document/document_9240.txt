The competition started on Monday, 9 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. what's more, day by day programs were accessible for sixpence. On the primary day, in radiant climate, ten matches were played, which finished the first round. Full match scores were distributed on the notice board inside the structure. F.N. Langham, a Cambridge tennis blue, was given a walkover in the first round when C.F. Buller, an Etonian and surely understood rackets player, did not show up. Julian Marshall turned into the principal player to win a five-set match when he battled once more from being two sets down against Captain Grimston. Spencer Gore, a 27-year-old rackets player from Wandsworth and at the time a land specialist and surveyor by calling, won his initially round match against Henry Thomas Gillson in straight sets. The five second-round matches were played on Tuesday, 10 July, again in fine climate. Charles Gilbert Heathcote had a bye in the second round. J. Lambert turned into the principal player in Wimbledon Championships' history to resign a match, surrendering to L.R. Erskine in the wake of losing the initial two sets. Julian Marshall again won a five-set match, this time against F.W. Oliver, while Gore vanquished Montague Hankey in four sets.
