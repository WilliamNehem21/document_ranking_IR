USÃÂ 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin out of the blue north of downtown Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that keeps running along the Montreal River. The thruway crosses the stream into Gogebic County and passes an appreciated focus in transit into a business area north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, USÃÂ 2 meets its solitary business course in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business course was beforehand a full circle that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the outskirt into Hurley and back to the principle expressway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has evacuated the signage on their side of the fringe, which decreased the circle to a business goad that closes at the state line. USÃÂ 2 proceeds with eastbound through UP forests to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the network of Ramsay, the roadway crosses a part of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake, meeting MÃ¢ÂÂ28 at a stoplight nearby. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two parts of the Presque Isle River. USÃÂ 2 and MÃ¢ÂÂ64 union and run simultaneously throughout the second part of the Presque Isle in the network of Marenisco. This simultaneousness has the most minimal traffic volume along the whole length of the roadway inside the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a day by day normal utilization along the stretch of 770ÃÂ vehicles, contrasted with the general normal of 5,188ÃÂ vehicles for the thruway. Toward the finish of the simultaneousness, MÃ¢ÂÂ64 swings northerly to keep running along Lake Gogebic.
