Suspected anthropogenic dangers that can fundamentally influence "Nothomyrmecia" incorporate territory devastation and discontinuity by railroad lines, streets and wheat fields. In the town of Ceduna, west of Poochera, neighborhood populaces of the subterranean insect were nearly disposed of after the region was bulldozed and consumed amid the establishment of an underground phone line, albeit adjacent locales had bigger populaces than those found in the annihilated site. Provinces may not endure tree-clearing, as they rely upon overhead overhangs to explore. Bushfires are another significant risk to the survival of "Nothomyrmecia", possibly obliterating important sustenance sources, including the trees they rummage on, and diminishing the number of inhabitants in a province. These ants may have recouped from past bushfires, yet bigger, increasingly visit flames may annihilate the populace. "Nothomyrmecia" ants can be protected from flames in the event that they stay inside their homes. Environmental change could be a risk to their survival, as they rely upon cold temperatures to scavenge and gather nourishment. An expansion in the temperature will keep laborers from scavenging, and not many regions would be appropriate for the species to live in. The virus twists passing over the Southern Ocean permit "Nothomyrmecia" to profit by the cool temperatures they requirement for evening time scavenging, so an expansion in ocean temperature could likewise possibly undermine it.
