In February 2009, Cooper hosted "Saturday Night Live" with musical guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one sketch. Later that year, he appeared in a supporting role in the film "He's Just Not That Into You". Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy "The Hangover" (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, one of the three friendsâalongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakisâto wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. "The Hangover" was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. "The New York Times" A. O. Scott wrote: "Mr. CooperÂ ... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie AwardsâBest Comedic Performance. The newspaper "The Daily Telegraph" opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with "Shave": "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered."
