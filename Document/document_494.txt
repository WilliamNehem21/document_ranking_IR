With the conceivable exemption of an outside calfskin covering, the Shorwell head protector had not many ornamental components. The nose-to-scruff and sidelong groups included thickened edges made by pounding the metal. These edges may have been brightening, yet they may likewise have been expected to fill in as "stop-ribs", forestalling edged weapons, for example, swords from looking downwards and striking the wearer on the shoulders or face. Three copper composite bolts are found on the dexter side of the forehead band, encompassed by what might be skin item. These may have worked to hold a connection tie, or a cheek watch made of something like cuir bouilli. The utilization of copper amalgam bolts, rather than the iron ones utilized on the remainder of the cap, may mirror an enriching impact saved for a non-basic component. It is conceivable that the outside of the protective cap may have been canvassed in cowhide or material, an enhancement potentially demonstrated on other Frankish caps, however it is excessively gravely decayed for this to be resolved. Any such cowhide could itself have been enriched; the calfskin or skin covers of some contemporary casings and sheaths show awed structures or examples brought up in help.
