The school introduces a symmetrical front to New Road and the palace hill, with four little peaks between a bigger peak at either end. There are two quadrangles, with steps driving down from the upper quadrangle (toward the east) to the lower quadrangle (toward the west). Private settlement for understudies and colleagues is situated in the lower quadrangle, while the lobby, library, and regulatory workplaces are in the upper quadrangle. The structures are two stories high, with dormers above. There are pools in the focal point of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the more drawn out of the two); the essayist Simon Jenkins said that these are "nearly puddles", and considered them to be relics of Harrison's Mediterranean arrangement. The essayist Peter Sager, in any case, felt that the lake speaks to the channel bowl that recently involved the site. The principle entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the lobby on its east side. The square-mullioned windows confronting the quadrangles are orchestrated in close-set gatherings of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the normal room has a bigger inlet window. A dynamic model by Hubert Dalwood, from 1962, has been situated on the grass inside the school. Dalwood additionally planned the wellspring in the pool in the upper quadrangle, despite the fact that his arrangement for a splash of water was not executed, "leaving the model with no undeniable reason".
