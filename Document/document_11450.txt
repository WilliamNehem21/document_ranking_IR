In the four years that pursued, Bayard tried to construct support for another keep running at the selection. He and Tilden went after help among Eastern moderates due to their help for the best quality level. The best quality level was less famous in the South, however there Bayard stacked his years-long backing in the Senate for genius Southern traditionalist approaches against Tilden's political machine and riches in the challenge for Southern representatives. A hit to Bayard's motivation came in February 1880 when the "New York Sun", a paper well disposed to Tilden, distributed a transcript of a discourse Bayard made in Dover, Delaware, in 1861. As the conditions of the Deep South were withdrawing from the Union, a youthful Bayard had broadcasted "with this severance, or insurgency, or defiance, or by whatever name it might be called, the State of Delaware has nothing to do", and encouraged that the South be allowed to pull back from the Union in harmony. To numerous in the South, this affirmed their perspective on Bayard as their hero, however incomprehensibly it debilitated Bayard's help with different Southerners, who expected that a previous Peace Democrat could never be worthy to Northerners. In the meantime, Bayard's firm position on the cash question pushed a few Democrats to help Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, who had not been related to either outrageous in the goldÃ¢ÂÂ silver discussion and had a military record that spoke to Northerners. As the tradition opened, Bayard was still among the main hopefuls, yet was a long way from sure of triumph.
