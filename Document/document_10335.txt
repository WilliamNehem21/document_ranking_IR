In 1923, in a joint effort with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first incredible achievement, however at first it was a "succÃÂ¨s de scandale". "FaÃÂ§ade" was first performed out in the open at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work comprised of Edith's refrains, which she discussed through an amplifier from behind a screen, while Walton directed a troupe of six players in his going with music. The press was commonly censorious. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy refers to as run of the mill a contemporary feature: "Empty talk That They Paid to Hear". "The Daily Express" abhorred the work, yet conceded that it was naggingly significant. "The Manchester Guardian" composed of "determined bedlam". "The Observer" censured the stanzas and rejected Walton's music as "innocuous". In "The Illustrated London News", Dent was considerably more thankful: "The group of onlookers was at first slanted to regard the entire thing as a ludicrous joke, yet there is dependably a shockingly genuine component in Miss Sitwell's verse and Mr Walton's music ... which before long prompted the gathering of people to tune in with winded consideration." In "The Sunday Times", Ernest Newman said of Walton, "as a melodic joker he is a gem of the principal water".
