The idea was depicted as "basic and splendid", "cunning", "shrewd", and "a one of a kind stage [for advertising] which is likewise a touch of fun". Teacher Martin Binks, executive of the Nottingham University Institute for Entrepreneurial Innovation, stated, "It is splendid in its simplicityÃÂ ... publicists have been pulled in to it by its noveltyÃÂ ... the site has turned into a marvel." "Mainstream Mechanics" stated, "There's no substance. No cool designs, giveaways or hot Paris Hilton recordings for watchers to salivate over. Envision a TV channel that indicates only ads, a magazine with only advertisements. That is The Million Dollar Homepage. An amazing case of the intensity of viral advertising". Wear Oldenburg of the "Washington Post" was one of only a handful few without applause for the site, considering it a "shabby, awesomely rewarding showcasing enormity, a publicizing barren wasteland of spam, flag promotions and pop-ups." Oldenburg proceeds, "it would seem that an announcement board on creator steroids, a publicizing train wreck you can't "not" take a gander at. It resembles getting each spring up promotion you at any point got in your life, immediately. It's what could be compared to all of a sudden feeling like you need to clean up."
