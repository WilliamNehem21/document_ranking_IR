Ann trusts the figures to be the apparitions of Quint and Jessel, trying to proceed their enthusiastic and rough sexual experiences through Miles and Flora. Notwithstanding, she is worried to find that others evidently can't see the phantoms. She at that point starts to presume that Miles and Flora, having been prepped by and associated with the exercises of Quint and Jessel, might be intentionally looking to bring the pair back. She sets out to leave Bly, in any case, when bidding a fond farewell to Miles, discovers that he, as well, sees the figures. Minutes in the wake of leaving, she requests to be reclaimed. Afterward, Ann alarms, trusting Miles and Flora to have gone out. She discovers them by the lake, yet they are playing generally; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She hurries to mediate, and thinks about the figure which switches back and forth among Quint and Miles. At the point when Ann over and over strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she never again wishes to see Ann. In the wake of requesting the staff and Flora far from Bly, Ann holds up with Miles to defy Quint. The pair are frightened, yet when Quint arrives Ann advises Miles to request that Quint disregard him. Miles (talking with Quint's voice) yells at Ann, yet inevitably (in his own voice) tells the spooky Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann grasps Miles, whose body goes limp.
