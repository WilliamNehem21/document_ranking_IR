The last round of dealings began at the imperial kraal on the morning of 30 October. The discussions occurred at an "indaba" between the "izinDuna" and Rudd's gathering; the ruler himself did not visit, however was adjacent. The "izinDuna" squeezed Rudd and his colleagues with respect to where precisely they intended to mine, to which they answered that they needed rights covering "the entire nation". At the point when the "izinDuna" challenged, Thompson demanded, "No, we should have Mashonaland, and straight up to the Zambezi tooÃ¢ÂÂtruth be told, the entire nation". As indicated by Thompson's record, this incited disarray among the "izinDuna", who did not appear to know where these spots were. "The Zambezi must be there", said one, mistakenly pointing south (as opposed to north). The Matabele agents at that point delayed the discussions through "hesitation and showcases of topographical obliviousness", in the expression of the history specialist Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson declared that they were finished talking and rose to leave. The "izinDuna" were to some degree frightened by this and requested that the guests please remain and proceed, which they did. It was then concurred that "inDuna" Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's advancement to the lord.
