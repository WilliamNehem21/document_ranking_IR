The Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn. It probably weighed about , the weight of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 replica. The framework, which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments, originally consisted of seven iron strips, each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick. A brow band, long and wide, encircled the head. Two strips of the same width ran from front to back, and from side to side. The long nose-to-nape band extended in the front and in the back; the extension over the nose was straight, whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards, so as to fit the nape of the wearer. The lateral band ran from ear to ear; both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band, but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection. It was affixed to the outside of the dexter (wearer's right) side of the brow band, the inside of the sinister (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-nape band. The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron, only one of which now survives. Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band from the centre of the lateral band. Here they were wide, and, while tapering towards a width of , rose at a 70Â° angle towards the lateral band, which they overlapped at a 50Â° angle just beneath the crest. The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth, since decayed.
