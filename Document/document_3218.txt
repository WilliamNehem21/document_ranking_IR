O'Reilly's last five star cricket went ahead a four-coordinate visit by an Australian group to New Zealand in mid 1946. O'Reilly was the bad habit skipper of the group, which was driven by Bill Brown. The principle installation amid the visit was a four-day coordinate against a delegate New Zealand side in Wellington, reflectively assigned as the main Test between the two nations in 1948. The unsure idea of the visit saw the Australians wear jackets named ABC for Australian Board of Control, instead of the typical crest. New Zealand were clobbered; in the wake of winning the hurl and choosing to bat on a downpour influenced pitch, they made 42 in their first innings and 54 in their second to lose by an innings and 103 runs. O'Reilly took 5/14 in the main innings, and 3/19 in the second, ruling with Toshack. It was his last Test and his last five star diversion. O'Reilly commanded in the other visit diversions too; he took coordinate aggregates of 9/103 and 8/128 against Auckland and Otago separately, and finished with 28 wickets at 10.60 for the visit. Having just chosen to visit New Zealand after much thought, O'Reilly resigned toward the finish of the Test, tossing his boots out of the changing area window.
