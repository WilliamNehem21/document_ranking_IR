Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding drove the official examination; he presumed that Parsons had been blending explode of mercury in an espresso can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the underlying blast, which declined when it came into contact with different synthetic compounds in the room. Forman considered this presumable, expressing that Parsons regularly had sweat-soaked hands and could without much of a stretch have dropped the can. A portion of Parsons' partners dismissed this clarification, saying that he was exceptionally mindful about wellbeing. Two associates from the Bermite Powder Company portrayed Parsons' work propensities as "carefully perfect" and "incredibly mindful". The last articulationÃ¢ÂÂfrom synthetic architect George SantymersÃ¢ÂÂdemanded that the blast more likely than not originate from underneath the planks of flooring, suggesting a sorted out plot to execute Parsons. Harding acknowledged that these irregularities were "mixed up" yet depicted the way in which Parsons had put away his synthetic concoctions as "criminally careless", and noticed that Parsons had recently been explored by the police for wrongfully putting away synthetic concoctions at the Parsonage. He likewise found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, proposing that Parsons was narcotized.
