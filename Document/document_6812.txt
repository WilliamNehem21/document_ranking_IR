In the 1918 midterm congressional decisions, held just before the truce, Republicans barely assumed responsibility for the Senate. Harding was delegated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no legislators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, sure that he could compel what turned into the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by speaking to the general population. When he came back with a solitary settlement building up both harmony and a League of Nations, the nation was overwhelmingly on his side. Numerous congresspersons loathed Article X of the League Covenant, that submitted signatories to the barrier of any part country that was assaulted, considering it to be driving the United States to war without the consent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 legislators who marked a round-robin letter restricting the League. At the point when Wilson welcomed the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to casually talk about the settlement, Harding capably examined Wilson regarding Article X; the president avoided his request. The Senate discussed Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a noteworthy discourse against it. By at that point, Wilson had endured a stroke while on a talking visit. With a weakened president in the White House and less help in the nation, the bargain was vanquished.
