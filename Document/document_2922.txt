The opening soprano solo in E significant, "I realize that my Redeemer liveth" is one of only a handful couple of numbers in the oratorio that has stayed unrevised from its unique structure. Its basic harmony violin backup and its reassuring rhythms obviously conveyed tears to Burney's eyes. It is trailed by a tranquil melody that prompts the bass' declamation in D major: "Observe, I disclose to you a secret", at that point the long aria "The trumpet will sound", checked ' ("stately yet not quick"). Handel initially composed this in da capo structure, yet abbreviated it to dal segno, likely before the main execution. The all-encompassing, trademark trumpet tune that goes before and goes with the voice is the main huge instrumental solo in the whole oratorio. Handel's unbalanced, continued worrying of the fourth syllable of "honest" may have been the wellspring of the eighteenth century writer William Shenstone's remark that he "could watch a few sections in "Savior" wherein Handel's decisions fizzled him; where the music was not equivalent, or was even "inverse", to what the words required". After a short solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the main two part harmony in Handel's last form of the music, "O demise, where is thy sting?" The song is adjusted from Handel's 1722 cantata ', and is in Luckett's view the best of the Italian borrowings. The two part harmony runs straight into the theme "However thanks be to God".
