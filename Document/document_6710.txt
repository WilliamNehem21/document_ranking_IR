Just as artistic styles, Clarke pastiches numerous Romantic abstract kinds: the parody of habits, the Gothic story, the silver-fork novel, the military experience, the Byronic legend, and the verifiable sentiment of Walter Scott. Truth be told, Clarke's epic maps the abstract history of the mid nineteenth century: the novel starts with the style and types of Regency England, an "Austenian universe of light, brilliant, shining discourse and polite culture", and step by step changes into a dull, Byronic story. Clarke joins these Romantic sorts with present day ones, for example, the dream novel, drawing on crafted by J. R. R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, T. H. White, and C. S. Lewis. As Maguire notes, Clarke incorporates rings of intensity and books of spells that start in these writers' works. Conversely, Sacha Zimmerman proposes in "The New Republic" that while Tolkien's reality is "altogether new", Clarke's reality is additionally captivating on the grounds that it is frightfully near the reader's. Albeit numerous commentators think about "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell" to the Harry Potter arrangement, Annie Linskey battles in "The Baltimore Sun" that "the reference is misdirecting": not normal for J. K. Rowling's books, Clarke's is ethically uncertain, with its mind boggling plot and dull characters.
