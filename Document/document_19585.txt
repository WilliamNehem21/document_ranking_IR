Roman gladiators fell into stock "categories" modelled on real-world precedents. Almost all of these classes were based on military antecedents; the "retiarius" ("net-fighter" or "net-man"), which was themed after the sea, was one exception. Rare gladiator fights were staged over water; these may have given rise to the concept of a gladiator based on a fisherman. Fights between differently armed gladiators became popular in the Imperial period; the "retiarius" versus the scaly "secutor" developed as the conflict of a fisherman with a stylised fish. The earlier "murmillones" had borne a fish on their helmets; the "secutores" with their scaly armour evolved from them. However, because of the stark differences in arms and armour between the two types, the pairing pushed such practices to new extremes. Roman art and literature make no mention of "retiarii" until the early Imperial period; for example, the type is absent from the copious gladiator-themed reliefs dating to the 1st century found at Chieti and Pompeii. Nevertheless, graffiti and artifacts from Pompeii attest to the class's existence by this time. Fights between "retiarii" and "secutores" probably became popular as early as the middle of the 1st century CE, and the net-fighter became one of the standard gladiator categories by the 2nd or 3rd century CE and remained a staple attraction until the end of the gladiatorial games. In addition to the man-versus-nature symbolism inherent in such bouts, the lightly armoured "retiarius" was viewed as the effeminate counterpoint to the manly, heavily armoured "secutor". The "retiarius" was also seen as water to the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fire, one constantly moving and escaping, the other determinedly inescapable. Another gladiator type, the "laquearius" ("noose-man"), was similar to the "retiarius" but fought with a lasso in place of a net.
