In August 1968 the unit made a "Complete Encounter Capsule", which was an austere, soundproofed room, wide and long, with green-painted dividers, a green one end to the other tangle on the floor and a roof containing a single direction reflect. It was vacant separated from a sink and latrine. In one of the most punctual employments of tape in treatment, TV cameras were prepared through the reflected roof and through gaps in the dividers. Fluid sustenance was given through drinking straws that were incorporated with the entryway. The Capsule's motivation, Barker composes, was to give "a position of undisturbed security where a little gathering of patients could concentrate on issues they felt imperative enough to warrant the rejection of the standard physical and mental diversions." Though cooperation in the STU program was required, entering the Capsule was intentional, and every patient could pick how long he spent inside. Gatherings numbered somewhere in the range of two and seven and remained in the space for as meager as 24 hours or for continued periods up to 11 days. Since Barker trusted that they were increasingly disposed to uncover their internal identities whenever unclothed, the detainees entered the Capsule bare. To additionally empower correspondence, they were managed with LSD-25. The room was lit consistently, making day unclear from night. While individuals from the program were inside the Capsule, different patients worked the room and looked out for those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and keeping up a fitting room temperature.
