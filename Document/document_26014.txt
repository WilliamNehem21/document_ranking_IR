In 1933 "Astounding" was acquired by Street & Smith, and it soon became the leading magazine in the new genre, publishing early classics such as Murray Leinster's "Sidewise in Time" in 1934. A couple of competitors to "Weird Tales" for fantasy and weird fiction appeared, but none lasted, and the 1930s is regarded as "Weird Tales"' heyday. Between 1939 and 1941 there was a boom in science fiction and fantasy magazines: several publishers entered the field, including Standard Magazines, with "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder Stories" (a retitling of "Wonder Stories"); Popular Publications, with "Astonishing Stories" and "Super Science Stories;" and Fiction House, with "Planet Stories", which focused on melodramatic tales of interplanetary adventure. Ziff-Davis launched "Fantastic Adventures", a fantasy companion to "Amazing." "Astounding" extended its pre-eminence in the field during the boom: the editor, John W. Campbell, developed a stable of young writers that included Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and A.E. van Vogt. The period starting in 1938, when Campbell took control of "Astounding", is often referred to as the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Well-known stories from this era include "Slan", by van Vogt, and "Nightfall", by Asimov. Campbell also launched "Unknown", a fantasy companion to "Astounding", in 1939; this was the first serious competitor for "Weird Tales". Although wartime paper shortages forced "Unknown"'s cancellation in 1943, it is now regarded as one of the most influential pulp magazines.
