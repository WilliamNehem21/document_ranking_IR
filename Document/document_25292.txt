The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22â24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in EckernfÃ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the High Seas Fleet. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, after which the fleet conducted the annual autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September. The exercises included landing exercises in northern Schleswig with IX Corps. On 1 October 1907, "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"âRear Admiral) Ludwig von SchrÃ¶der came aboard "Preussen", taking command of the squadron, as Fischel had become the chief of the "Marinestation der Nordsee" (Naval Station of the North Sea). The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November.
