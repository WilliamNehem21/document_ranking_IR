The city has begun moving far from the car and towards mass travel. From 2004 to 2009, the yearly number of unlinked open transportation trips expanded by roughly 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed recommendation 2 (Transit Now) which expanded transport administration hours on high ridership courses and paid for five transport quick travel lines called RapidRide. In the wake of dismissing a streets and travel measure in 2007, Seattle-zone voters passed a travel just measure in 2008 to build ST Express transport administration, broaden the Link light rail framework, and grow and improve Sounder suburbanite rail administration. A light rail line from downtown traveling south to Sea-Tac Airport started administration on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first fast travel line with middle stations inside as far as possible. An expansion north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further augmentations are wanted to reach Northgate and Lynnwood toward the north, Federal Way toward the south, and Bellevue and Redmond toward the east by 2024. Voters in the Puget Sound area endorsed an extra duty increment in November 2016 to grow light rail to West Seattle and Ballard just as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.
