No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron landed at Sattler Airfield south of Darwin on 12ÃÂ January 1945 and got its new air ship in the blink of an eye a short time later. It started to move to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) on 6ÃÂ February and ended up operational there as a component of No.ÃÂ 80 Wing toward the finish of March. The squadron directed ground assault forays against Japanese positions on close-by islands until the finish of the war and furthermore wound up in charge of Morotai's air safeguard from 28ÃÂ May. Albeit no Japanese air ship were experienced here, a few Spitfires were shot somewhere near enemy of air ship shoot amid ground assault fights. Activities were prevented on occasion by faculty deficiencies, and a considerable lot of the aviators who were presented on the unit were made a decision by the squadron's officer to have been insufficiently prepared. On 30ÃÂ July No.ÃÂ 80 Wing was disbanded and the squadron turned into the primary flying unit relegated to the recently shaped No.ÃÂ 11 Group. This gathering was in charge of battalion obligations in a lot of Borneo and the eastern NEI. No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron dropped handouts on Japanese positions after Japan consented to surrender on 15 August and came back to Australia in October 1945. It was disbanded at Oakey Airfield on 12ÃÂ November that year. The unit endured 13 lethal losses amid the war. In late 2010 the squadron was granted fight respects for its World War II administration in the Pacific, New Britain and Morotai.
