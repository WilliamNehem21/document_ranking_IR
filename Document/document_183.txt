Flame is another vital component in the support of the Everglades. The dominant part are brought about by lightning strikes from rainstorms amid the wet season. Their belongings are to a great extent shallow, and serve to cultivate further plant development: sawgrass will consume above water, yet the roots are saved. Flame in the sawgrass bogs serves to keep out bigger hedges and trees, and discharges supplements from rotting plant matter more proficiently than disintegration. Substantial consumed territories additionally influence waterflow, since wind and water are undaunted by the annihilated sawgrass; water may stream a few times quicker in as of late consumed regions. Amid the wet season just dead plant matter and the tips of plants are singed; in any case, the impacts of flame are substantially more critical in the dry season, as flame might be nourished by natural peat and consume profoundly, wrecking root frameworks. The main hindrance to the spread of flame in the Everglades is the nearness of water. It takes around 225ÃÂ years for one foot (0.3ÃÂ m) of peat to grow, yet the peat isn't as thick as it ought to be for the 5,000ÃÂ years of the Everglades' presence. Researchers point to flame as the reason.
