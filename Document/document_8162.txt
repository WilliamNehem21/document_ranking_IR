In a reference to a lyric titled "Discourse toward the Western Indians", Arent DePeyster, British commandant from 1774 to 1779 at Fort Michilimackinac (a previous French fortification in what was then the British Quebec region), noticed that "Baptist Point deSaible" was "an attractive negro", "knowledgeable", and "settled in Eschecagou". When he distributed this lyric in 1813, DePeyster introduced it as a discourse that he had made at the town of Abercroche (presently Harbor Springs, Michigan) on July4, 1779. This commentary has driven numerous researchers to accept that Point duSable had settled in Chicago by 1779; however letters composed by merchants in the late 1770s propose that Point duSable was right now settled at the mouth of Trail Creek ("RiviÃÂ¨re duChemin") at what is currently Michigan City, Indiana. In August 1779, amid the American Revolutionary War, Point duSable was captured as a speculated factional at Trail Creek by British troops and detained quickly at Fort Michilimackinac. An officer's report following his capture noticed that Point du Sable had numerous companions who vouched for his great character. The next year, he was requested transported to the Pinery. From the late spring of 1780 until May 1784, Point duSable dealt with the Pinery, a tract of forests asserted by a British officer, Lt.Patrick Sinclair, on the St. Clair River in eastern Michigan. Point duSable and his family lived in a lodge at the mouth of the Pine River in what is currently the city of St. Clair.
