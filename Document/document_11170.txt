In 1938 Olivier joined Richardson to film the government agent spine chiller "Q Planes", discharged the next year. Plain Nugent, the pundit for "The New York Times", thought Olivier was "not exactly so great" as Richardson, yet was "very worthy". In late 1938, attracted by a compensation of $50,000, the on-screen character made a trip to Hollywood to take the piece of Heathcliff in the 1939 film "Wuthering Heights", close by Merle Oberon and David Niven. In under a month Leigh had gone along with him, clarifying that her outing was "halfway on the grounds that Larry's there and in part since I mean to get the piece of Scarlett O'Hara"Ã¢ÂÂ the job in "Run with the Wind" in which she was in the long run cast. Olivier did not appreciate making "Wuthering Heights", and his way to deal with film acting, joined with an aversion for Oberon, prompted pressures on set. The chief, William Wyler, was a hard slave driver, and Olivier figured out how to expel what Billington portrayed as "the carapace of drama" to which he was inclined, supplanting it with "a tangible reality". The subsequent film was a business and basic achievement that earned him a selection for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and made his screen notoriety. Caroline Lejeune, composing for "The Observer", thought about that "Olivier's dim, cranky face, unexpected style, and a specific fine self-importance towards the world in his playing are perfect" in the job, while the commentator for "The Times" composed that Olivier "is a decent epitome of HeathcliffÃÂ ... sufficiently noteworthy on a progressively human plane, talking his lines with genuine qualification, and constantly both sentimental and alive."
