Before Hendrix was 19 years of age, law experts had twice found him riding in stolen vehicles. Given a decision between jail or joining the Army, he picked the last mentioned and enrolled on May 31, 1961. Subsequent to finishing two months of essential preparing at Fort Ord, California, he was doled out to the 101st Airborne Division and positioned at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He landed on November 8, and soon a short time later he kept in touch with his dad: "There's only physical preparing and provocation here for about fourteen days, at that point when you go to hop schoolÃÂ ... you get hellfire. They work you to death, objecting and battling." In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his better half Betty Jean Morgan's home in Seattle, requested that his dad send it to him as quickly as time permits, expressing: "I truly need it now." His dad obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words "Betty Jean" to Fort Campbell. His obvious fixation on the instrument added to his disregard of his obligations, which prompted insulting and physical maltreatment from his friends, who in any event once concealed the guitar from him until he had asked for its arrival.
