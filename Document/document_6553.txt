Toward the beginning of February 1904, the Japanese Navy propelled an unexpected assault on the Russian armada at Port Arthur. "Sevastopol" was hit by one shell, either six or eight creeps in distance across, that injured two men on her scaffold. She before long turned in interest alongside different boats of the Russian armada, all discharging their forward firearms, however she neglected to score any hits. On 26 March 1904, "Sevastopol" was coincidentally slammed by , harming a propeller. After the assault on Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron attempted to break out a few times. Amid one endeavor on 23 June, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, instructing the Pacific Fleet, withdrew in the wake of experiencing the Japanese armada. Moving toward the harbor, "Sevastopol" moved somewhat out of arrangement and hit a mine that slaughtered 11 and caused extreme flooding, yet figured out how to get inside the harbor and tie up. She was under fix for about a month and a half, amid which time a flame broke out on deck, killing two and injuring 28. The Russian warships were too enormous to fit into the dry dock at Port Arthur, so expansive caissons were worked to give access to the boats' bodies. On 9 August, with the Japanese Third Army attacking the external safeguards of Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base. Despite the fact that "Sevastopol" was not completely fixed, she cruised with the remainder of the armada with one weapon in her toward the back turret staying inoperable. They later drew in the Japanese armada in what might turn into the Battle of the Yellow Sea.
