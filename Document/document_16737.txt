As HSSPF, Meyszner was not restricted to police matters. His subordination to Bader was "personal and direct" but this did not mean the police and security apparatus he commanded was subject to day-to-day direction from Bader's headquarters staff. Military jurisdiction over Meyszner and his organisation was restricted to matters involving the military security of the territory and military operations. Meyszner's duties also extended to any matter related to the "strengthening" of the German minority in Serbia, which included authority over the security forces of the puppet regime and collection of revenue and the consolidation and utilisation of existing Volksdeutsche volunteer units in the "Waffen-SS". Almost as soon as he arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner met with "SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer" Werner Lorenz, the Chief of the "Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle" (Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans, or VoMi), founded to manage the interests of the "Volksdeutsche" outside the borders of the Reich. The VoMi was also responsible for orchestrating the Nazi ideology of "Lebensraum" (living space) in Eastern Europe. Meyszner also met with "SS-ObersturmfÃ¼hrer" (SS-Lieutenant colonel) Sepp Janko, the leader of the "Volksdeutsche" in the Banat and with "SS-BrigadefÃ¼hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" Artur Phleps, to discuss the formation of the new division, the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen". Plans for more general conscription of the "Volksdeutsche" did not meet with approval from Berlin.
