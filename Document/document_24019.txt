The diet of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks ("Allocasuarina" and "Casuarina", including "A.Â torulosa" and "A.Â verticillata"), but also "Eucalyptus" (including "E.Â maculata" flowers and "E.Â nitida" seeds), "Acacia" (including gum exudate and galls), "Banksia" (including the green seed pods and seeds of "B.Â serrata", "B.Â integrifolia", and "B.Â marginata"), and "Hakea" species (including "H.Â gibbosa", "H.Â rugosa", "H.Â nodosa", "H.Â sericea", "H.Â cycloptera", and "H.Â dactyloides"). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced "Pinus radiata" and to other introduced trees, including "Cupressus torulosa", "Betula pendula" and the buds of elm "Ulmus" species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine ("Pinus halepensis"), alongside native species.
The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is very fond of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle "Tryphocaria acanthocera", and cossid moth "Xyleutes boisduvali". Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.
