Charles guaranteed Strafford that "upon the expression of a ruler you will not endure throughout everyday life, respect or fortune", and the attainder couldn't succeed if Charles retained consent. Moreover, numerous individuals and most friends were against the attainder, not wishing, in the expressions of one, to "submit murder with the sword of equity". Be that as it may, expanded strains and an endeavored upset by royalist armed force officers in help of Strafford and in which Charles was included started to influence the issue. The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a huge edge (204 in support, 59 contradicted, and 230 went without), and the Lords submitted (by 26 votes to 19, with 79 missing) in May. On 3 May, Parliament's Protestation assaulted the "mischievous direction" of Charles' "discretionary and domineering government"; while the individuals who marked the request embraced to shield the ruler's "individual, respect and domain", they additionally vowed to safeguard "the genuine transformed religion", parliament, and the "rights and freedoms of the subjects". Charles, dreading for the security of his family despite turmoil, consented reluctantly to Strafford's attainder on 9 May subsequent to counseling his judges and clerics. Strafford was decapitated three days after the fact.
