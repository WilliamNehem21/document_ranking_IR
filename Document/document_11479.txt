An indigenous recorded source uncovers that regions managed by the focal government were composed along these lines to the Seleucid Empire. They both had a triple division for their commonplace progressive systems: the Parthian marzbÃÂn, xÃÂ¡atrap, and dizpat, like the Seleucid satrapy, eparchy, and hyparchy. The Parthian Empire likewise contained a few subordinate semi-independent kingdoms, including the conditions of Caucasian Iberia, Armenia, Atropatene, Gordyene, Adiabene, Edessa, Hatra, Mesene, Elymais, and Persis. The state rulers administered their own regions and stamped their own coinage unmistakable from the illustrious coinage delivered at the royal mints. This was much the same as the prior Achaemenid Empire, which additionally had some city-states, and even far off satrapies who were semi-autonomous however "perceived the matchless quality of the lord, paid tribute and gave military help", as indicated by Brosius. Be that as it may, the satraps of Parthian occasions administered littler domains, and maybe had less renown and impact than their Achaemenid ancestors. Amid the Seleucid time frame, the pattern of nearby managing administrations with semi-self-ruling principle, and in some cases through and through insubordinate standard, wound up ordinary, a reality reflected in the later Parthian style of administration.
