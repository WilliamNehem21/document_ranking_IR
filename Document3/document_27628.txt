After commissioning in 1901, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" joined her sister ships in the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). After her sister ran aground and had to be docked for repairs, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" replaced her as the I Squadron flagship, which was commanded by Prince Heinrich, the brother of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when "Kaiser Friedrich III" returned to service. In the meantime, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was present for the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June and the dedication of a monument at the "Marineakademie" (Naval Academy) in Kiel. At the end of July, she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters, and while docked in CÃ¡diz, they rendezvoused with the "Brandenburg"-class battleships returning from East Asian waters. The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, though the late arrival of the "Brandenburg"s delayed the participation of the I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training. The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight, followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower Elbe. Gunnery drills took place in Kiel Bay before the fleet steamed to Danzig Bay, where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December, which included a stop at Oslo from 7 to 12 December.
