Among contemporary audits, "Time" magazine proclaimed "Something" to be the best track on "Nunnery Road", while John Mendelsohn sent in "Moving Stone": "George's vocal, containing not so much adenoids but rather more grainy Paul tunefulness than any time in recent memory, is one of numerous features on his 'Something,' a portion of the others being increasingly fantastic drum work, a dead appealing guitar line, impeccably stifled strings, and a curiously decent song. The two his and Joe Cocker's adaptation will get the job done pleasantly until Ray Charles gets around to it." Writing in "Saturday Review" magazine, Ellen Sander depicted "Something" as "absolutely a standout amongst the most wonderful melodies George Harrison has ever stated" and included: "He feels his way through the tune, naturally slicing through its body and into the center, emoting so plainly thus nimbly that right now he rings 'I don't have the foggiest idea, I don't have any acquaintance with,' it is appeared even what isn't known can be comprehended." Lon Goddard of "Record Mirror" portrayed the tune as "another lovely Harrison organization" in the style of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", saying that "It jumps scales in its substantial symphonic course of action, at that point floats down to George's straightforward yet compelling guitar style." In his audit of the single, Derek Johnson of the "NME" commended the track as "a genuine quality hunk of fly" with a "strident lead guitar which oozes a mean and grouchy quality". Johnson expressed his lament that Harrison "isn't highlighted all the more normally as an artist", and finished up of "Something": "It's a melody that develops on you, and imprint my words, it will Ã¢ÂÂ bigly!"
