Long's hypotheses about creature medical procedure collected negative consideration from mainstream researchers just as the abstract; scholar William Morton Wheeler wrote to "Science" in February 1904 that Long's story was "a progression of accounts which for rank and inconceivable adaptation of the creature can barely be outperformed." Other researchers concurred about the irregularity of Long's cases, and openly reprimanded him for not giving proof as to his perceptions in a logically acknowledged arrangement. Since quite a while ago reacted thusly, demanding that "If researchers and near analysts are really searching for new actualities in the creature world, I have enough to fill a few ordinary releases of "Science", all of which is upheld by my very own perception, yet by the declaration of other fair men whose word can be taken decisively." As to the woodcock story, Long given a few records from other men who had seen to such an extent; an Ohio man, for instance, supposedly found after shooting a comparable flying creature that it "had clearly broken its leg over the knee joint. There was a gauze around it, made out of a hard dirt like substance, interlaced with grass or a woody fiber or something to that affect. The bone appeared to have been set legitimately and had sew superbly." None of Long's observers had the capacity to give examples to contemplate, notwithstanding, and "Science" pursued Long's exposition with the note, "We Hope that this exchange won't be conveyed further."
