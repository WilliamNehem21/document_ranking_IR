An official novelization of the amusement, titled "Lord of War", was declared in July 2009, alongside a novelization of "Divine force of War II". It was composed by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman, and was distributed on May 25, 2010, by Del Rey Books. In a meeting for "Play" magazine, Vardeman said a folklore book written during the 1930s got him inspired by Greek folklore, and the opportunity to take a shot at the "Lord of War" novel "was an open door not to be missed". He said giving the perusers a strong plot establishment was important and the novel required additional material with the goal that it didn't just pursue the activity of the diversion. In spite of the fact that he has not played the diversion, he said "Divine force of War" depended on the conventional Edith Hamilton Greek folklore, basically "the acknowledged folklore on steroids". Vardeman called Kratos a significant character, proceeding, "This contention of thought processes makes him an incredible, whenever pained, saint." He affirmed his work on the second "Divine force of War" novel, saying there are numerous potential story thoughts for Kratos and that "it would be a disgrace" if there were not extra books to fill in the subtleties of his missions, for example, accounts of the time while he was a flunky of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King. "Divine force of War" was named for the International Association of Tie-in Writers Scribe Award as best adjusted novel in 2010.
