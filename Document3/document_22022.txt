After graduating, Hoffman worked in off-Broadway theater and made additional money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a "Law & Order" episode called "The Violence of Summer", playing a man accused of rape. His first cinema role came the following year, when he was credited as "Phil Hoffman" in the independent film "Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole". After this, he adopted his grandfather's name, Seymour, to avoid confusion with another actor. More film roles promptly followed, with appearances in the studio production "My New Gun", and a small role in the comedy "Leap of Faith", starring Steve Martin. Following these roles, he gained attention playing a spoiled student in the Oscar-winning Al Pacino film "Scent of a Woman" (1992). Hoffman auditioned five times for his role, which "The Guardian" journalist Ryan Gilbey says gave him an early opportunity "to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling". The film earned US$134 million worldwide and was the first to get Hoffman noticed. Reflecting on "Scent of a Woman", Hoffman later said "If I hadn't gotten into that film, I wouldn't be where I am today." At this time, he abandoned his job in a delicatessen to become a professional actor.
