On 14 December 1939, Quisling met Hitler. The German chief guaranteed to react to any British intrusion of Norway (Plan R 4), maybe pre-emptively, with a German counter-attack, however discovered Quisling's arrangements for both a Norwegian overthrow and an Anglo-German harmony unduly idealistic. In any case, Quisling would in any case get assets to reinforce "Nasjonal Samling." The two men met again four days after the fact, and thereafter Quisling composed an update that expressly revealed to Hitler that he didn't view himself as a National Socialist. As German intrigues kept, Quisling was purposefully kept in obscurity. He was likewise weakened by a serious episode of disease, most likely nephritis in both kidneys, for which he denied hospitalization. Despite the fact that he came back to take a shot at 13 March 1940, he stayed sick for a little while. Meanwhile, the Altmark Incident entangled Norway's endeavors to keep up its lack of bias. Hitler himself stayed in two personalities about whether a control of Norway ought to require a welcome from the Norwegian government. At last, Quisling got his summons on 31 March, and reluctantly ventured out to Copenhagen to meet with Nazi insight officers who approached him for data on Norwegian safeguards and resistance conventions. He came back to Norway on 6 April and, on 8 April, the British Operation Wilfred initiated, carrying Norway into the war. With Allied powers in Norway, Quisling anticipated a naturally quick German reaction.
