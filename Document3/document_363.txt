The time of 1954 was to be HMAS "Australia's" rearward in administration, with the ship directing Royal and Vice Regal assignments as a portion of its last obligations. In February and March, HMAS "Australia" filled in as a major aspect of the escort for the Royal Yacht "Gothic" amid the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's crowning ceremony visit. The cruiser was given the Gloucester Cup on 25 March as the ship "viewed as preeminent all in all proficiency, tidiness, seamanship and specialized preparing" amid the time of 1953. As one of the ship's last obligations with the Navy, "Australia" was entrusted with transporting Field Marshal Sir William Slim, the Governor-General of Australia, alongside his better half and their staff on a journey around the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef and the Whitsunday Passage. The voyage left on 4 May, and after two days "Australia" shot its 8-inch weapons for the last time. While in the Coral Sea, a Dutch maritime ship was found to be weakened off the bank of Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, and was thusly towed by "Australia" to Cairns. McNicoll was later named a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch government for his salvage of the ship.
