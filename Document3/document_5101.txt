The nineteenth century pastor and curator Harry Longueville Jones questioned the need to supplant the old church and denounced its "despairing destiny", depicting the purposes behind its end as "guises". In his view the main piece of the congregation that required fix was the "ruinous" western end (which had been "seriously developed in the principal occasion"), yet this part was spared while the "great bits of the structure" were obliterated. Moreover, the expense of the new church was more than twofold the expense of fixes to the medieval church, which could have "endure[d] for a long time to come". He included that it may have been believed to be protected, as it was so near Lord Boston's home and in this manner "under the shadow of the master of the area", and he censured the "detestable hour" in which "the merciless hand of the destroyer was permitted to be lifted against it by those whose first obligation it was to see that it took no damage". He expressed that "when structures, committed to God's administration by the devotion of previous ages, are permitted to be treated as such by the comprised experts of the landÃÂ ... the foundations to which they are connected can't be relied upon to discover more prominent support on account of the whimsical and oblivious huge number." He likewise noticed that the new church was just somewhat bigger than its forerunner.
