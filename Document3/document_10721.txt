Dorset has various limestone edges which are for the most part shrouded in either arable fields or calcareous prairie supporting sheep. These limestone zones incorporate a wide band of Cretaceous chalk which crosses the province as a scope of slopes from north-east to south-west, fusing Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, and a tight band running from south-west to south-east, joining the Purbeck Hills. Between the chalk slopes are huge, wide vales and wide flood fields. These vales are specked with little towns, homesteads and coppices, and incorporate the Blackmore Vale (Stour valley) and Frome valley. The Blackmore Vale is made out of more established Jurassic stores, to a great extent muds sprinkled with limestones, and has generally been an inside for dairy horticulture. South-east Dorset, including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth, involves more youthful Eocene stores, for the most part sands and dirts of poor farming quality. The dirts made from these stores bolster a heathland living space which supports every one of the six local British reptile species. A large portion of the Dorset heathland has Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) status with three regions assigned as universally essential Ramsar destinations. In the furthest west of the district and along the coast there are visit changes in shake strata, which show up in a less clearly successive path contrasted with the scenes of the chalk and the heath. In the west this outcomes in a bumpy scene of differing character that takes after that of neighboring province Devon. Marshwood Vale, a valley of Lower Lias mud at the western tip of the province, deceives the south of the two most astounding focuses in Dorset: Lewesdon Hill at and Pilsdon Pen at .
