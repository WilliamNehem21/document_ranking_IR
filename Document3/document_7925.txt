On her arrival from Germany to Normandy and Anjou, she styled herself as ruler and the girl of King Henry. Amid the common war for England, her status was questionable. The Anglo-Saxon rulers of England had practiced impressive formal power, yet this convention had decreased under the Normans: at most their rulers managed briefly as officials for their spouses' sake when they were away voyaging, instead of in their own right. At first somewhere in the range of 1139 and 1141 Matilda alluded to herself as going about as a "feme sole", "a lady acting alone", featuring her self-sufficiency and freedom from her better half Geoffrey. She had a magnificent incredible seal made, which was round like the seal of a ruler Ã¢ÂÂ rulers utilized an oval seal Ã¢ÂÂ yet which indicated Matilda enthroned as a sovereign and titled as the Queen of the Romans. The seal did not demonstrate her on horseback, be that as it may, as a male ruler would have been delineated. Since she was never delegated at Westminster, amid the remainder of the war she seems to have utilized her title of Lady of the English, instead of that of the Queen of England, albeit a few counterparts alluded to her by the illustrious title.
