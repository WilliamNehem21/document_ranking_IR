The genus is distinguished from other cheirogaleids by the toothrows on its maxilla (upper jaw), which are parallel and do not converge towards the front of the mouth. The fork-marked lemur dental formula is ; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molarsâa total of 36Â teeth. Their upper first incisor (I) is long and curved towards the middle of the mouth (unique among lemurs), while the second upper incisor (I) is small with a gap (diastema) between the two. The upper canines are large, with their tips curved. Their upper anterior premolars (P) are caniniform (canine-shaped) and more pronounced than in any other living lemur. The next upper premolar (P) is very small, with a single, pointed cusp that contacts the lingual cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side), which circles the base of the tooth. The two cusps on the last upper premolar (P) are a large paracone and a smaller protocone. Like other cheirogaleids, their first lower premolar (P) is caniniform and large, while the cingulids (ridges) on the three lower premolars are more developed compared to most other cheirogaleids. The first two upper molars (M) have a developed hypocone, and the buccal cingulum (a crest or ridge on the cheek side) is well developed on all three upper molars. The molars are relatively small compared to other cheirogaleids, with the second upper and lower molars (M and M) having reduced functionality compared to those of mouse lemurs.
