In 1934, MDSRC had prescribed enlarging the whole of USÃÂ 113 from to . Beside the Pocomoke City Bypass, augmenting and remaking of the U.S. Roadway in that state did not happen until after World War II. USÃÂ 113 was broadened and reemerged from the north end of Berlin to the Delaware state line in 1947 and 1948 and from Pocomoke City to south of Snow Hill in 1948. The roadway through Berlin was reemerged in 1949. The U.S. course from the north end of Snow Hill to Newark was augmented and reemerged in 1951 and 1952. State powers remade or augmented seven extensions along the previously mentioned extended segments in 1952 and 1953. USÃÂ 113 through Snow Hill was remade and enlarged in 1953 and 1954. The last two bits of USÃÂ 113 to be recreated were through Newark and Ironshire toward the southern end of Berlin somewhere in the range of 1954 and 1956. Rather than enlarging the current interstate, the U.S. Roadway was based on for the most part new arrangement, with the northern portion through Ironshire built as the main carriageway of a future isolated interstate. The County Commissioners of Worcester County consented to acknowledge for upkeep the circumvent expressways, Newark Road and Shire Drive, from Maryland SRC in March 1957.
