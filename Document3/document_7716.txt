Since no contemporary Roman sources notice his name, the precise personality of the "Astronomica"s creator is an enticing inquiry, yet his name was likely Marcus Manilius. This vulnerability has prompted Marcus Manilius being befuddled throughout the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, referenced by Pliny the Elder in his "Naturalis Historia"); Flavius Manlius Theodorus (fl.c.AD376409, a delegate in AD399) and BoÃÂ«thius (the 6th century Roman representative and creator of "De consolatione philosophiae", whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus BoÃÂ«thius). In spite of the fact that the lyric recommends that the author was a native and inhabitant of Rome, some have fought that Manilius was a non-Roman; as indicated by Katharina Volk, a Latinist who has practical experience in Manilius, this conviction is commonly founded on either "the writer's evidently sub-par Latinity" or "the desire to consider Manilius to be the individual from a Greek scholarly milieu at Rome". The nineteenth century classicist Fridericus Jacobs and the nineteenth and twentieth century student of history Paul Monceaux have contended that he was an African, in light of on his composition style, which they state looks like that of other African creators. Volk counters this view, contending that Manilius expresses "from ... a customary Roman viewpoint" and "takes plan of action to Roman history to represent the prophetic certainties he talks about".
