This contradiction finished in September 1962. As a major aspect of the development of the military in light of Indonesia's strategy of "encounter" with its neighbors, the RAAF was guided by the Australian Government to lead a dire assessment of short departure and landing flying machine and overwhelming lift helicopters that could be acquired to improve the Army's strategic portability. A group of seven RAAF officers headed by Group Captain Charles Read, the chief of operational prerequisites, was quickly dispatched to the United States and evaluated the Sikorsky S-61, Boeing Vertol 107-II and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The group made a decision about the Chinook to be obviously the most appropriate of these sorts, and prescribed that few be procured; this was in accordance with the Army's inclination. The Government in this way acknowledged a proposal made by the RAAF to obtain a bundle of twelve Caribou fixed-wing flying machine and eight Chinooks, and submitted a request for these flying machine inside long stretches of the assessment. The Chinook request was dropped by the Government when it was found out that it would take quite a long while for the helicopters to be conveyed, and the RAAF's requests of Caribous and Bell UH-1 Iroquois strategic transport helicopters were extended.
