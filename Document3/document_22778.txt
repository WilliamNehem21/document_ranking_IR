The inner temple is accessed by a small staircase leading into a ruined chapel with five statue niches. The chapel and offering hall were surrounded by storerooms; as elsewhere in the temple, there were more storerooms to the north than south. The "antichambre carrÃ©e" a square antechamber separated the chapel from the offering hall. The room measures on each side, and is the smallest such chamber from the Old Kingdom. It has been largely destroyed. It was originally entered through a door on its eastern side, and contained two additional doors leading to the offering hall and storeroom. The room contained a single column made of quartzite fragments of which have been found in the south-west part of the temple quarried from the Gabel Ahmar stone quarry near Heliopolis. Quartzite, being a particularly hard stone a 7 on the Mohs hardness scale was not typically used in architectural projects. It was used sparingly as a building material at some sites Old Kingdom sites in Saqqara. The hard stone is associated with the sun cult, a natural development caused by the coloration of the material being sun-like. Remnants of a granite false door bearing an inscription concerning the souls of the residents of Nekhen and Buto marks what little of the offering hall has been preserved. A block from the door has been displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
