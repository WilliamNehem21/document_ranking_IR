Not all pundits were inspired with the collection. Blabbermouth.net commentator Borivoj Krgin pretentiously named the collection as "another disappointment on the band's part to step up and rehash themselves." Krgin portrayed King as "the more fragile and less innovative of the two principle musicians" (King and Hanneman), feeling the collection pursued "a commonplace heading that quite often sounds worn out and constrained" because of King being the collection's primary lyricist. Krgin likewise singled out Araya for analysis, and considered the vocalist an "empty shell of his previous self, flaunting a singing style that is dreary, without imagination and now and again for all intents and purposes unlistenable." Krgin granted the record 6 out of 10, and finished the survey by seeing that "Slayer's quickly reducing record deals ("Diabolus In Musica" has moved under 300,000 duplicates in the US contrasted with 600Ã¢ÂÂ 700,000+) as a sign that the band is in desperate need of another rent on life." "The Washington Post" gave it a blended audit, expressing, "obviously, what Slayer says should be about as essential as how it says it: The riffs are all overdriven and choking, and that is a cognizant choice. In its least complex structure, a tune like "Outcast" could be mistaken for Motorhead pushed through the sharp edges of a garden cutter, yet that is undercutting Slayer; guitarist Kerry King effectively battles the score that normally originates from playing substantial shake and-roll."
