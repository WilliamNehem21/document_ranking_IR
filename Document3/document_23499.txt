Early reviews of "To Autumn" focused on it as part of Keats's collection of poems "Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems". An anonymous critic in the July 1820 "Monthly Review" claimed, "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,âto be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,âand to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." Josiah Conder in the September 1820 "Eclectic Review" mentioned, "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." An anonymous reviewer in "The Edinburgh Magazine" for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit."
