"Versus XIII"s development was headed by the team behind the console "Kingdom Hearts" games. Like "XIII", the game was a PS3 exclusive. As early as 2007, Square Enix considered re-branding "Versus XIII" as a numbered entry in the main series due to the rapidly growing scale of the project. The game was eventually re-branded in 2011 as "Final Fantasy XV". As part of its later marketing, "Final Fantasy XV" was deliberately distanced from the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" brand to remove the consequent limitation on their target audience, although lore and design elements were retained. The game was also moved fully onto eighth generation consoles and developed using the company's new Luminous Studio engine. The PS3 version was abandoned due to concerns about the console's continued viability. "Final Fantasy XV" eventually had help from multiple developers, including HexaDrive, XPEC Entertainment and Umbra. In contrast to "Final Fantasy XIII", Tabata decided against creating any sequels to "Final Fantasy XV", instead expanding the base game through DLC. The first season of DLC was well received, so a second season was commissioned. All but one of these later DLC episodes was cancelled in 2018 following the decision by the team to focus on a new intellectual property.
