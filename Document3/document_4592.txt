Darwin was all around arranged to contrast this with de Candolle's "warring of the species" of plants and the battle for presence among natural life, clarifying how quantities of an animal groups kept generally steady. As species dependably breed past accessible assets, good varieties would improve creatures at enduring and passing the minor departure from to their posterity, while troublesome varieties would be lost. He composed that the "last reason for such an excess of wedging, must be to deal with appropriate structure, and adjust it to changes", so that "One may state there is a power like a hundred thousand wedges attempting power into each sort of adjusted structure into the holes of in the economy of nature, or rather framing holes by pushing out more fragile ones."
