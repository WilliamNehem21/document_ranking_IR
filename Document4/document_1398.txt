The film contains further self-referential material, as a film about an essayist experiencing issues composing (composed by the Coen siblings while they were experiencing issues stating "Mill operator's Crossing"). Barton is caught between his very own craving to make important craftsmanship and Capitol Pictures' have to utilize its standard traditions to acquire benefits. Audrey's recommendation about after the recipe would have spared Barton, however he doesn't notice it. Be that as it may, when he puts the secretive bundle on his composition work area (which may have contained her head), she may have been helping him after death, in different ways. The film itself toys with standard screenplay equations. Likewise with Mayhew's contents, "Barton Fink" contains a "decent wrestler" (Barton, it appears) and a "terrible wrestler" (Charlie) who "stand up to" one another toward the end. Yet, in normal Coen style, the lines of good and underhandedness are obscured, and the alleged saint in actuality uncovers himself to be hard of hearing to the pleadings of his "regular man" neighbor. By obscuring the lines among the real world and strange experience, the film subverts the "straightforward profound quality stories" and "guides" offered to Barton as simple ways for the essayist to pursue.
