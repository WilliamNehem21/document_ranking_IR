Fannie Taylor and her significant other moved to another plant town. She was "apprehensive" in her later years, until she surrendered to disease. John Wright's home was the main structure left remaining in Rosewood. He lived in it and went about as an emissary between the province and the survivors. After they left the town, practically the majority of their property was sold for duties. Mary Jo Wright kicked the bucket around 1931; John built up an issue with liquor. He was excluded and provoked for helping the survivors, and reputed to keep a weapon in each room of his home. He passed on in the wake of drinking an excessive amount of one night in Cedar Key, and was covered in a plain grave in Sumner. The sawmill in Sumner torched in 1925, and the proprietors moved the task to Lacoochee in Pasco County. A few survivors just as members in the crowd activity went to Lacoochee to work in the factory there. W. H. Pillsbury was among them, and he was provoked by previous Sumner inhabitants. Never again having any supervisory expert, Pillsbury was resigned right on time by the organization. He moved to Jacksonville and passed on in 1926.
