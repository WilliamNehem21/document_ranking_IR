The mind blowing fairywren is a little, since quite a while ago followed fledgling long. Displaying a high level of sexual dimorphism, the rearing male is unmistakable with a splendid blue temple and ear coverts, a violet throat and more profound rich blue back wings, chest and tail with a dark bill, eye band and chest band. The blue rearing plumage of the male is regularly alluded to as matrimonial plumage. The non-rearing male is darker with blue in the wings and a somewhat blue tail. The female looks like the non-rearing male yet has a chestnut bill and eye-fix. Youthful guys will shed into reproducing plumage the primary rearing season in the wake of incubating, however this might be inadequate with leftover tanish plumage and may take one more year or two to consummate. Both genders shed in harvest time in the wake of rearing, with guys accepting a shroud non-reproducing plumage. They will shed again into matrimonial plumage in winter or spring. Some more established guys have stayed blue all year, shedding straightforwardly starting with one year's marital plumage then onto the next. Rearing guys' blue plumage, especially the ear-coverts, is profoundly brilliant due to the straightened and bent surface of the barbules. The blue plumage additionally reflects bright light emphatically, thus might be much increasingly conspicuous to different fairywrens, whose shading vision reaches out into this piece of the range. The call is depicted as a spouting reel; this is harsher and more intense than different fairywrens and shifts from individual to person. A delicate single "trrt" fills in as a contact call inside a searching gathering, while the caution call is a "tsit". Cuckoos and different gatecrashers might be welcomed with a risk pose and churring danger. Females discharge a "murmur" while agonizing.
