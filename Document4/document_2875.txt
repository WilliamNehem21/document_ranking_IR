The two air sports that are most firmly identified with skimming are hang floating and paragliding. Albeit every one of the three games depend on rising air, there are huge contrasts which are recorded in detail in . The primary distinction is that both hang lightweight flyers and paragliders are more straightforward, less refined and less expensive flying machine that utilization the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang lightweight flyers have no defensive structure around the pilot. Be that as it may, the separating line between fundamental lightweight planes and advanced hang-lightweight planes is winding up less unmistakable. For instance, hang lightweight planes regularly use texture wings, formed over a system, yet drape lightweight flyers with unbending wings and three-hub controls are additionally accessible. The lower velocities and lower skim proportions of ordinary hang lightweight planes implies that shorter crosscountry separations are flown than in present day lightweight planes. Paragliders are increasingly essential specialty. They are likewise foot-propelled, however their wings for the most part have no edges and their shape is made by the stream and weight of air. The velocities and float proportions of paragliders are for the most part lower still than the average hang lightweight planes, thus their crosscountry flights are significantly shorter. Radio-controlled coasting utilizes scale-models of lightweight flyers for the most part for edge taking off; anyway thermic aeromodelling make are likewise utilized.
