Gordimer's reaction to the novel's unbanning was, "I was not interested in the feelings of the first oversight board of trustees who neither read nor comprehended the book legitimately in any case, and to those of the council of artistic specialists who made this disclosure, since both are a piece of the restriction framework." She ascribed the unbanning to her universal stature and the "genuine consideration" the book had gotten abroad. Various unmistakable creators and artistic associations had challenged the prohibiting, including Iris Murdoch, Heinrich BÃÂ¶ll, Paul Theroux, John Fowles, Frank Kermode, The Association of American Publishers and International PEN. Gordimer protested the unbanning of the book since she felt the legislature was attempting mollify her with "exceptional treatment", and said that something very similar would not have happened had she been dark. In any case, she described the activity as "something of a point of reference for different journalists" in light of the fact that in the book she had distributed a duplicate of a real handout composed and conveyed by understudies in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the experts had restricted. She said that comparable "transgressions" later on would be troublesome for the controls to clasp down on.
