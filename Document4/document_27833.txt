As the first widely read political novel in the United States, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to "Uncle Tom's Cabin" include "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair and "Silent Spring" by Rachel Carson.
Despite this undisputed significance, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" has been called "a blend of children's fable and propaganda." The novel has also been dismissed by a number of literary critics as "merely a sentimental novel," while critic George Whicher stated in his "Literary History of the United States" that "Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book."
Other critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that "To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may ... prove a startling experience." Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day.
