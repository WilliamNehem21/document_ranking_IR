Blackbeard and Bonnet left Delaware Bay and returned to the Caribbean in November, where they successfully continued their piracy. On 17Â November, a 200-ton ship named the "Concorde" was attacked by two pirate craft nearly away from the island of Martinique. The lieutenant on board described the pirate vessels as one having 12 guns and 120 men and the other having eight guns and 30 men. The crew of the "Concorde" put up a fight, but surrendered after the pirates bombarded them with "two volleys of cannons and musketry". Blackbeard took the "Concorde" and sailed south into the Grenadines, where he renamed the ship "Queen Anne's Revenge", possibly as an insult to King George I. Some time after 19Â December, Bonnet and Blackbeard separated. Bonnet now sailed into the western Caribbean. In March 1718, he encountered the 400-ton merchant vessel "Protestant Caesar" off Honduras. The ship escaped him, and his frustrated crew became restive. When Bonnet encountered Blackbeard again shortly afterwards, Bonnet's crew deserted him to join Blackbeard. Blackbeard put a henchman named Richards in command of the "Revenge". Bonnet, surprised that his colleague had betrayed him, found himself as a guest aboard the "Queen Anne's Revenge". Bonnet confided in a few loyal crew members that he was ready to give up his criminal life if he could exile himself in Spain or Portugal. Bonnet would not exercise command again until the summer of 1718.
